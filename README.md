# Description 

This repository contains files and codes used in the thesis "Exploring Modelsâ€™ Performance for Abusive Language Detection: The Case of Obfuscated Abusive Terms" in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MA Linguistic
(Text Mining) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Februari 2024. 

The study focuses on exploring SVM and BERT models performance in detecting abusive language, particularly focused on introducing various obfuscation techniques targetted swear words. The obfuscation techniques applied are inspired
by the real-world scenario within the DreamsLab Project (https://krr.cs.vu.nl/). 

# Structure of repositories
- code, contains all of the code script use for data preprocessing, experiment, and data analysis.
- data, contains the two used dataset for the experiment.
- keyword, contains the abusive lexicon use for the obfuscations.
- predictions, contains the models' predictions on the two used datasets, both for standard and obfusated version
- svm, contains saved SVM model.
