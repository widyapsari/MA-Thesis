good informative video i think something that wasnt mentioned that could affect a womens wage is the likelihood of them taking time off or quiting their job all together i think men get paid more because they are much less likely to be out of work for children for maternity leave from a companys point of view its just more reliable to pick a man to do the job and in a general sense they are a more financially sound choice,NOT,NOT

trish this is so amazing im so excited for you from one vegan to a now vegan in my opinion any reason to change your diet to veganism is a good reason i went mostly for ethical reasons but losing weight and toning up happens regardless if youre trying this out for two weeks in order to feel a little slimmer for your shoot try to only drink water lemon water will help a ton to lose bloating that might occur when increasing your vegetablefruit intake eat when youre hungry please please do not restrict freelee is right you can eat as much as you want if youre eating a plant based diet raw or not the first week you might be a little gassy or a little bloated but dont let this discourage you by the end of week two your body will have adapted a lot more to the new diet so you should be waking up looking nice  tight i hope you see this as i want you to be successful in this as it can be a total and complete game changer quinoa  beans and any dark green vegetable will be high in protein i encourage you to look up vegan recipes to play around with its fun and dont be afraid to try different vegan restaurants in your area they can open your eyes as to how wonderful food on this lifestyle can be good luck trish and keep digging around youtube and the internet for vegans that inspire you muah xx,NOT,NOT
trish this is great news going vegan can be really hard at first so dont beat yourself up and give up on veganism if you make mistakes i made mistakes when i first went vegan such as accidentally eating parmesan cheese on my spaghetti at a restaurant and eating sour cream that was mixed in with guacamole its okay just pick yourself and carry on what matters is that youre trying dont just eat fruits and vegetables though i recommend morning star garlic and quinoa vegan burgers on a bun with lettuce tomato onion ketchup and sour cream get some cans of chick peas they are delicious and hummus and pita bread its so good you can make a great meal with hummus on bread with fresh veggies they also have vegan frozen pizzas that you can sprinkle vegan cheese shreds on it make smoothies in the mornings or have toast with vegan butter bagels with pbj the options are endless please dont just eat fruits and veggies and starve yourself and give up on veganism good luck we support you,NOT,NOT

here are my tips for you the most important tip is to eat until you get full do not try and eat as much as freelee you will feel sick  keep it simple  dont try to follow in sort of guidelines what i mean by this is do not eat a bunch of raw foods because its not pm yet  if following raw till  trust me you will end up over eating because you didnt have what you are craving just about everything can be made vegan if you get a craving have a little bit for example i crave pizza chocolate waffles etc what i do is look up vegan recipes where to find those vegan teams and eat them if i crave chocolate i buy the bar and i eat a square or two and then tuck it away for a rainy day  while any exercise is good exercise i recommend you do a little more than normal ex taking a morning walkjog as well as dancing  educate yourself it well help you build a deeper connection that way you stay on track if you get off track get back on youre gonna do great,NOT,NOT
ye but men dont take tasks for their tasks because you cant when i was younger my dad couldnt come to my matches or to the store with me because his boss didnt let him he let woman working with him do so but not men of cource men are going to get more money if they cant leave work to spend time with their children he couldnt be with me most weekends so of course he got more money if mens jobs are less flexible then they are going to work more therefore gain more,NOT,NOT

the stat that said that women still did the majority of child care despite both parents being in full time jobs my initial thoughts were  how many hours overtime is the man doing  what are the couples professions is one say a receptionist and one is an industrial engineer it was not stated but elsewhere in the vid it shows that woman as a group earn less per year than a man so you can infer that the full time woman is still probably working less hours in a lower paid job than her husband that said both parents should take a more equal role in child rearing than still seems the case today,NOT,NOT

thank you for not jumping to the conclusion that it is discrimination or oppression like sjwsthe wage gap in specific careers really boils down to flexibility in hoursand women focusing on children is often the result of interplay between couples or lack of couples a lot of mothers would rather be the primary caregiver rather than the father it does not mean that the men are lazy how dare those dads not raise kids more or the mothers are lazy how dare those moms focus on the easy task of raising kids of instead of nonchild care chores and work its just their preferences,NOT,NOT

i went to a very good high school but it was soooo politically biased my junior english teacher and history teacher in high school were and are best friends extremely intelligent women and now great mothers but they were also the type of feminists to project any information that made them mad even if it wasnt entirely true the wage gap misconception was definitely the most glaring of those offenses by teaching all of their students this misconception both my history class and english class got into debates about feminism also because it was relevant to the curriculum and people used this wage gap as their base of support that showed the inequality among men and women in the workplace today in the process my school basically trained a bunch of smart kids to not think critically and just assume statistics were true or false based on if it agrees with their political views or not clearly this video proves that the wage gap many of my friends and teachers had in mind is not real but is in the form of a much more reasonable statistic if one was to actually look further into the data instead of getting excited about the it thinking it is true and then ignoring the critical thinking process because they want the information to be true all because it supports their cause while i do believe that there should be equality in the workplace there is no way that we can ignore what is actually causing much of the inequality in average pay to sum up this huge comment thank you vox and everyone involved with this video for creating a piece related to feminism with good critical and analytical thinking skills instead of spewing incredibly biased and false feminist stories while you made a lot of feminists look bad for yelling wrong information at people for so long you also made the movement look much better because you acknowledged as a very feminist channel that something many feminists believe is true is not thanks again,NOT,NOT

im sorry but i think these facts should be examined carefully st companies do not only want to reduce costs they are willing to hire better professionals paying them more nd women tend to chose low paying majors not just because of simple individual will culture sex roles family etc are mediating variables that influences these decisions same in men men are raised hearing they should beare good at math and fixing things also they are socially rewarded by compliments etc by being good at these fields no doubt they chose engineering and math as a major their toys as kids are astronaut dolls and mechanics women toys are babies and nurse barbie women are raised as the caring ones the mommy ones no doubt they chose social work and early education it is sexism people dont make decisions out of nowhere culture and society are playing a role there rd we need to examine why men are willing to be on call in a job men have the pressure to be the provider in the family thats why they are willing to be on call willing to have a better salary women dont have these pressure and the ones who have it are not the standard this video has some points but i think every idea exposed here needs to be discussed in a deeper way it shouldnt be this simple to talk about a subject this complex,NOT,NOT

no thats not how it works these are all reliable facts but these have all been already considered its still true that women often earn less for the exact same work over the exact same time instead watching stupid videos on youtube that actually have a rightwinged agenda you should inform yourself properly,NOT,NOT
watch matt lush here on youtube he is a vegan also he knows alot  try veggie grill in la,NOT,NOT
this video doesnt address hiring  promotion policies or the fact that two people doing the same job may be paid differently usually the woman earning less some women are completely willing to work long hours and yet they still get paid less also according to the acfe women are less likely to commit fraud so maybe companies should consider hiring more women into higher level positions,NOT,NOT
i seriously dislike freelee as a vegan i prefer to watch the unnatural vegan instead and other youtubers who use science and evidence to back up reasons for going vegan beyond animal rights and how to make sure you dont have a bad transition track your nutrition and research places to eat to help give yourself a safety guard from accidentally meatanimal products ,NOT,NOT
say anything with gumption and theyll believe you,NOT,NOT
well done trisha if i was you id look up some accidentally vegan junk foods that you like now a lot of pringles flavours dark chocolate etc do some research and i really recommend getting pinterest theres so many great vegan recipes on there also hotforfood is an amazing youtube channel with tones of amazing recipeswell done on trying this lifestyle so wonderful cause youve such a huge influence ignore all the negative vegans and embrace us positive ones  also i wouldnt try to be super super healthy straight away maybe just do the vegan version of your current diet  and i wouldnt expect instant results this diet is slow and steady not a fad one youll get there in the end and stay there  love your videos always make me smile ,NOT,NOT

i personally think she really does have identity issues sorry i know issues doesnt sound right but i cant think of the right word i think we need to come at her more gently because its so clear that trisha has so many different problems and i do believe that shes actually working hard to change herself but theres so much going on and she just wants to belong maybe shes not trans but shes very much confused i dont think she was doing this just for money she is a very confused and damaged person that needs to really focus on herself and people need to cut her some slack,NOT,NOT

notice how the gap in pay jumped up in the ssomething big must of happened then whispers equal pay act of  also people need to note that jobs do not have equal amount of men or womenmeaning theres mostly men in the tech field theres mostly women in nursing theres mostly men on oil rigs or theres mostly women social workers with each field paying differently there should of been a comparison of same jobs from the same companies as different companies do pay different salaries for different jobs when the initial survey or study was done,NOT,NOT
yes it is fair that your child be excluded because they are biologically a male,ABU,ABU

good job vox the video is both factually correct and proposes the solutions to solve the gender gap that exists in the same profession on the same position this an intellectually honest and interesting video the problem is that it will not solve the infamous  cents to a dollar since women will still be more likely to take part time job or be home stay mother and against what feminists say it is valid and respected choice so this  should be dropped all together,NOT,NOT

what was the point of putting this up when its like month old video and you obviously did not stick to being vegan,NOT,NOT
it sounds like shes describing a gender fluid person  im so confused,NOT,NOT
sure the estrogen treatments will bring the testerone levels down but even with that theyre still going to have a lot more testerone in their bodies than the average female walking around a lot more and then of course you have the difference of bone structure so of course they have an advantage theyre men saying theyre transgender or taking estrogen doesnt change that their chromosomes are still xy and always will be god bless them and i hope one day they come to the truth,ABU,NOT
we need to show this to everyone and give this amazing woman an award for being so awesome,NOT,NOT

lol thats not really true she twists the data to show what she wants but you cant really expect her to present on wage gap while shes agaisnt feminism while i was working in service early college years i was doing basically nothing but was paid more than my female counterpart the problem with wage gap is that women have lower hourly wage than men this can of course change if youre manager and negotiate about your potential income but if youll come somewhere for some basic noschool position and theyll offer you less only because youre a women thats the problem,NOT,NOT
lol most of these vegan nuts are pro abortionexplain that,NOT,ABU

wow this is great my tip would be to eat as much as you want within a meal avoid snacking between meals and dont be too fanatical about exactly what it is youre eating ie how healthy it is  as if you can find things you enjoy and also make you satiated the longer youre going to stick with it and actually become less obsessive about what youre missing out on also dont worry about what others think or say about your choices just know within yourself  and be happy within yourself that you are doing this for the right purposes ,NOT,NOT

what i would like to know is how many single women live on starvation pay after pension compared to single men because these women continue to pay men about  cdn per hour for construction for example and vehicle maintenance people about  an hour while most of these wealthy male pensioners can do their own work i suspect most women on pension earn about half of what men receive and therefore have serious troubles paying for food clothing medicine medical care etc in old age compared to what men have it seems no government will ever dare tally the differences in each province or state with regard to single female pensioners versus male because they dont want to admit that old men are living like kings compared to old women who in many cases are starving,NOT,NOT

when i saw the title what people miss about the gender wage gap i thought it would talk about how blatantly the wage gap is calculated by just dividing the average earning of a male by the average earning of the counterpart female but nooo this video along with certain feminists yes not all feminists are alike just like how all muslims arent terrorists politicians and celebrities completely ignore the fact that some women choose different careers and work hours hey by the way the number of employed men that are alive should also different from the number of existing employed women well thats just a hunch and im  so judge what you will furthermore just for a second lets assume that the wage gap is in fact real and women get paid c for every dollar a male makes that said why for what reason dont all companies hire only women since it is c cheaper than hiring a male dont companies want the most bang for their buck and not spend more money than they have to this would save tens of thousands maybe millions of dollars every year if their workforce only was comprised of women well who knows anyways i am not trying to diss women here please that is not the message i am trying to get across if that is how you feel i apologize moreover i do concede that women do work less than men in most cases due to their schedule and that is what this video talks about and that is what we should be worrying about and for that reason i did not dislike the video but nor did i give it a thumbs up so fighting to get rid of the stereotypical notion that women should be at home solely responsible for the kids is the real war we should be fighting and we are we are progressing but we are obviously not there yet and everyone should be contributing this also isnt just about women but everything that concerns another humans well being paraphrased from mlk so there isnt anything wrong about a feminist or any advocate for that matter as long as you are well educated so what im trying to say is earning does not equal wage cookiopuss ps youtuber neither is the earth flat and thanks for reading all of this if you did,NOT,NOT

this is still where you are incorrect about any kind of earnings gap pertaining to gender the gap doesnt exist at all to say that it is still only  makes anyone with this claim incorrect this is why politics suck a specific political stance will try to generalize everyone and think they are compatible within the generalization we are not like apples and oranges the comparisons are more like beets and bananas there has been a controlled scientific study that took a singular case under extreme measures to further disprove such a myth the males and females were of same age applying for the same position ethnicity and even the experience behind it the employer was told that the first  being hired could not have an increased starting pay if negotiated for it and needed  females as well as  males  from each gender had to fit low class criteria the same rule also applied for black skinned and white skinned and so it had less discriminative power the other  of each gender were going to be split the same way but of middle class this was a closed off  year experiment do you know what happened within this study the men did  more work than the average employee all  asked for more hours after  weeks this does not including job training and  asked for a raise after the first year while the counterpart female was  less productive than the average employee  females one lower class black and one middle class white took  days off after  years only one of the females asked for a raise after  in a half years additionally  of the males were looking for another part time job while working with the one they had no wonder the gap is seen as a large problem between genders males just seem to work harder and they are reprimanded for it,NOT,NOT

so you have to somehow make companies and corporations to change their work ethic for women to shrink the pay gap the median shows that there are less woman making high wages compared to men and vox even admits that having kids greatly effects it having kids is a choice isnt itneeding flexible hours to accommodate taking care of your kid was a thing that happened to choice why must we actively try to change the wage gap if it doesnt even determine how successful a woman can be a solution could be to have more woman that dont have kids and dedicate lots of their time to work the wage gap is essentially not even oppressive but rather showing of how family systems tend to work it all comes down to whether or not you will settle down for a family or continuously put your knife to the grindstone,NOT,NOT
yes omg beans and rice and lentils are so versatile in cooking so many dips and falafels are surprisingly vegan going vegan also encourages a lot of home cooking like curries and other rice dishes dips and cool potatoes so try to make time for that too just remember that a lot of junk food may be vegan but that doesnt mean its healthy also for chocolate most dark chocolate should use soy instead of cow milk also drink loads of water just for the general toning of your body and keep dancing good luck trisha congratulations ,NOT,NOT

my mom simply stays home and actually takes her of her kids kids need a lot of attention but also restrictions to develop properly women are just designed to care for their kids breasts i dont want to say that women shouldnt be able to work but if they decide for a kid they should be able to invest time into their kids and not be forced to put them in a crche many people have problem with the teenagers today and i think a partial reason for that is parents spending less time parenting im  diligent and smart and i think part of that is because my mom set me rules because thats what a kid needs before it is able to realize itself that watching tv all day is a bad idea hrmusahrm,ABU,NOT

how does a man know he feels like and therefore wants to be a woman how does he know what a female feeling feels like asking a man to describe female feelings is like asking a blind person to describe color whats the perceived difference between male and female feelings anyway if we can agree that theres no definition on feelings and their connection to your biological sex is it about the physical manifestation of gender do trans men just want their own boobs and vagina to play with and to go into womens toilets are they homosexuals that cant face reality and believe finding men attractive must make them women im interested to learn,NOT,NOT
i dont get the hate from the usual subjects according to their standards trisha is trans and we must accept that despite her not making any effort to transition if she claims that she is trans or any other gender identity that is obviously the only thing that matters and we have to play along with that so as to not trigger an instance of dysphoria otherwise we are obviously being transphobic at least gigi is being principled by playing along because the rest of the left sure isnt lmao,NOT,NOT

great video my only recommendation is that for a data heavy presentation like this you make you citations more accessible a lot of them would be really interesting to follow up also when you present try to sit up because when you lean over you have less control of the air coming out of your body and it leads to excessive vocal growls at the end of every sentencewhich is a common nervous issue great use of diagrams and i appreciated the slight pauses inbetween dense bits of data also a great job of breaking down statistics i have a much better understanding of what issues are related to wage gaps now after seeing this video,NOT,NOT

look into demiboy demigirl nonbinary and gender non conforming im not saying youre trans or youre not as a transmasculine demiboy i think that i have no room to judge anyone ive been judged way too much myself for that but i think you really really need to educate yourself and not harm a community that has been harmed way to much sorry its hard to know when youre trolling and when you arent anymore and thats your own fault please educate yourself not just for your sake for once,NOT,NOT
its okay to be confused i confused body dysmorphia for gender dysphoria and i was under the transgender label for two years i was lost and didnt have answers to my questions i am now happy and going by sheher born gender its okay to be confused and try to find yourself whats not okay is saying you are trans when you are  comfortable with being the born gender you are its okay if you want to be t and you want to be more masculine however i dont think this is the right label now when you are finding yourself its okay to go through things and see what fits and what doesnt but i would suggest making that a personal journey off camera and coming back when you find yourself the trans community and the lgbt community in general get a lot of hate because people throw labels they know nothing about on themselves as a trend trans people are no longer valid in societies eyes because of transtrenders  not saying what you are going through is a trend but its something that takes more time and shouldnt be determined by the fact that you like gay men and you feel like you would be more respected if you had a penis its true you may not be just a cis women and i hope that you are able to find and love yourself because thats all anyone deserves i dont think you should be hated but i dont think you should jump into this label either because it will only cause backlash for you and the trans community with that said i hope you do well and find who you really are  in the end you are the one who knows yourself best,NOT,NOT

hi blaire i wanted to comment about the trisha situation i can admit honestly that up until now i did not always agree with your message mainly i didnt understand where it was coming from truly i am in a similar spot as some other younger trans people and i have to say things like this do not help its improper representation of trans people and its awful how trisha felt the need to capitalize as you mentioned but when this is one of the more trending videos this is what people associate us with and it is hurtful because it does indeed feel like trisha is mocking our very real struggles also i have learned so much about how to discuss these things across your videos overall that helped me shape my own understanding i just wish at the end of the day we honestly could help eliminate these problems im just surprised that gigi being a trans woman herself would support trisha i know her heart is in a extremely good place but it makes me wonder if gigi actually thinks that,NOT,NOT
so what im getting from this she has more guy friends and likes them more than her female friends so shes a guy thats the case with many girls she doesnt like attention all the time but she likes to dress up sometimes thats the case with a lot of humans in general she identifies as a man because she likes gay guys and therefore if she identifies as a guy shell somehow attract them girls can be attracted to less masculine men and be cis she wants to be more assertive and recognizes male privilege and recognizes she wouldnt be called a bitch for being ambitious as a guy ok obviously,NOT,NOT
trish honey how are you gonna back out of this one,NOT,NOT

i understand youre an edgy troll but this video is really hurtful ive been subscribed for years but after this i cant continue to support you youre misinterpreting what it means to be transgender and using it as a way to get attention,NOT,NOT
the fact of the matter is that when you look at the big picture women generally do not want the same job types as men far more men go into stem jobs like engineering mathematics science and technology those jobs pay way more as a result when you look at the total amount of money earned between men and women men make more but when you account for the differences in job types and education the wage gap vanishes to a much smaller amount  cents per dollar  not the  cents claimed to illustrate this point further white people only make  cents for every dollar that an asian person makes the reason is not because there is some discrimination going on it is the exact same reason that men make more than women as a whole this is because even more asians go into stem jobs than average caucasians wage gaps really have very little to do with discrimination it just so happens that women for whatever reason do not choose to go into higher paying jobs and do not choose to work as much overtime etc and it just so happens that asians go into high paying jobs even more that is why whites make  cents for every dollar than an asian makes and that is why women make  cents per dollar that men make its just looking at the total amount of money that a group makes it is not accounting for differences in what types of jobs different groups go into it does not account for voluntary overtime differences and it does not take into account educational differences etc its only looking at the total income of men versus women  and this produces a very misleading result,NOT,NOT

if a woman you know is earning less than a man for the exact same job you should call a lawyer women have equal opportunity in modernised countries which means that they are free to pursue the same careers that men do the fact that less women choose to do this is where the wage gap comes from its a result of a personal decision from a woman and if its problem then more women should be transferring to the higher risk jobs that men dominate through fair process not discrimination and closing that gap we dont need to look into the wage gap because there is no difference in womens earning for the same job there is no discrimination in this gap between incomes and therefore it isnt an issue this isnt a feminist argument this is a study of the choices women make and they make those choices not because of some form of oppression or patriarchy but because they have the freedom to choose their job and less women choose high risk high paying jobs it doesnt prove anything other than that im not saying people cant research it its quite interesting to observe human choices but im saying that this can never be used to advocate a feminist issue because the way it is misrepresented over and over again makes it sound like one and anyone who uses it as such is either intellectually dishonest or retarded,NOT,NOT

this got me thinking about intersexed people have they been allowed to compete i mean if someone is born both sexes then they might have an unfair advantage or not depending where they get placed to compete mens or womens sports i believe what used to be done in this situation was to just throw them into womens sports i do remember some news stories about this and i have to say it is rather unfair its not only unfair to the women but to the intersexed as well it would seem a solution would be start another division for intersexed but with so few births being so who would fund it on top of that it wouldnt be fair for transgendered to be thrown in with the intersexed division because of whos taking what hormone could have an unfair advantage so would a fourth subset for transgender athletes be needed again who is going to fund it it gets kind of crazy the transgender thing is one issue but what about those who are intersexed this idea of sports competition seems more legit because intersexed people arent choosing to be another sex like how it is said about transgendered should sports be off limits to the intersexed and if so wouldnt that be unfair so technically this is the same problem different issue,NOT,ABU

men are expected to be the bread winner theyre expected to work hard and always earn more money get more promotions etc etc women arent expected to work therefor when they do work they arent expected to work harder and they like men get paid for what they do meaning they get paid less,NOT,NOT
but what about the fact that men are more often considered for promotions that identical resumes with the only difference being gender result in the female being offered lower pay or flat out rejected why is it that the national womens soccer team pulled in more views on their world cup victory but was paid a fraction of the mens team who didnt even come close obviously theirs a lot of factors that come into all these calculations and a lot of good points are raised in this video such as the dangerous work conditions but i think with the information accessible it is still hard to discern where the issue lies women are more likely to be stay at home parents whereas boys are often more encouraged to pursue these high paying careers likewise that men are more willing to work longer hours and are very possibly more qualified i believe that their might still be a gender wage gap at play but its a lot more complex than a lot of people put it out to be in my opinion more research and information should be gathered in order to finally put this question to rest,NOT,NOT
wow thanks for this info i never knew the truth,NOT,NOT
yes there is,NOT,NOT
the biggest argument for there not being a pay gap is the equal pay act of  which made it illegal to discriminate against womens pay every year there is an average of  law suits over the violation of this law roughly  percent win thats  people a year can actually prove that they were discriminated against in the workplace thats mind bogglingly few people,NOT,NOT

i mean with the system that we have its impossible to ever get to a discussion about the wage gap im not a woman i dont know what its like in the workplace as a woman im still a student i havent even worked before if you go on the internet and look for studies you will find what satisfies your agenda but you wont necessarily find things that accurately show the practical lives of women in the workplace unless you actually go through women to women telling everyone that they are experiencing all sorts of discrimination which are relatively unique to women men have their own problems theyre treated awfully in dangerous work they dont even get the proper care they need when injured they work longer hours and are even pressured at times to do so to the point where they want to do so a system in place to ensure that both men and women are paid the same for the same positions of the same jobs with the same level of commitment should be in place everywhere and there is really no denying that i couldnt care less about labels such as feminists or mens rights activists i care about the truth whether or not it challenges my own deeply held beliefs its really hard to face them but you have to do it or others and yourself will suffer,NOT,NOT

to the comments about this being old footage it honestly doesnt matter whether or not she has eaten animals since this doesnt matter because the journey to veganism is not easy for most people trisha may relapse multiple times what matters is that she is making the effort towards being vegan its important that she keeps going back to it and getting educated so that she can figure out what works best for her and eventually get to the place she wants to be if youre vegan yourself think about how hard it truly was to transition probably you had to make many enormous life changes so you could become vegan trisha is just really starting this journey finally realizing how veganism is a good thing and she should let it into her life cut her some slack this is an opportunity for education not for belittlement if you dont welcome her into the community she wont want to or have the resources to stay,NOT,NOT

also thats not true you cannot eat as much as you want even on a vegan diet there are vegan cakes cookies cupcakes ice cream and you cant just eat all of them just because theyre vegan you will still gain a ton of weight so the whole you can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet is absolute bullshit,NOT,NOT
finally huntyyyyy okay okay so im gonna start off by saying you probably gained weight on a vegetarian diet because of the dairy which is arguably worse then meat okay so some snacks you could do are potatoes literally potatoes are your best friend my favorite is japanese sweet potatoes because yes another thing is if you want to make something that requires eggs use flax seed eggs as a vegan alternative which you can get a target  as far as milk i prefer sweetened almond milk over soy milk,NOT,NOT

ok but why do we perceive female dominated professions as requiring less skills and money etc for example computer programming and coding was considered a low level menial job when it was female dominated yet now coders make oodles of money and the job has a lot of respect we respect physicians yet in russia where medicine is a predominantly female workforce they have no respect for the profession there librarians were once respected and well paid and even now when they have more skills and education than ever before they are laughed at and paid like shit ever since females started dominating the profession teaching was also the same i dont think women are paid less for simply being women i think we value male work over female work if you compare education levels for different jobs you will find that in female dominated industries they will be lower paying than similar levels of education than in male dominated industries since women have taken over the field of biology the median wage has gone down  wages for designers fell by  when females started to gain ground in the industry of the  top highest paying professions  are male dominated,NOT,NOT

hi freelee ive been watching through a lot of your videos recently and you have been such an inspiration that i really think i wanna go vegan in the near future luckily im moving back onto campus in  weeks where ill have access to a full kitchen and away from my large family that i live with who makes having a different eating lifestyle a difficult task but my main concern is will i be able to make sure my body is getting what it needs i have problems with my appetite and rarely feel hungry the act or even just the thought of eating most of the time makes me nausous and dizzy its extremely unhealthy i know and i wanna work towards fixing it have you encountered anyone who had this problem what kind of tips can you recommend on ways to make sure ill be eating enough to live heathily on a vegan lifestyle it would mean the world to me if you could point me in the right direction or if anyone else has any words of wisdom,NOT,NOT

women should be the ones most upset with this to work for equality and to train hard for a sport only to have the success taken away from you and then not being able to speak up because you will be considered transphobic a person has the right to be what they want to be but a biological born male should never compete in women sports period its just not fair,ABU,ABU
riley dennis mtf lesbian trisha ftm gay drag queen omg i think this just became a legit thing,NOT,NOT
always always be smart and ask questions when you go out to eat dont buy animal products just because the rest of ur friends are you have to keep motivated and with veganism your have to eat a larger volume of food to get more calories because plant foods are less calorie dense which is sometimes the reasons why you can get full easier since ur stomach is much more filled up than with a small piece of meat at the bottom of your stomach and also keep track of vitamin intake youre most likely going to lack in vitamin b so maybe purchase a supplement or fortified foods to help overcome that and also a lot of plant foods contain nonheme iron which is harder to absorb than heme ironin meats but to fix that you need to keep up your vitamin c levels  orange juice vitamin gummies in order to absorb it more efficiently and protein should be fine if you eat more lentils and quinoaespecially quinoa because it is a perfect proteinthats my advice for u good luck,NOT,NOT

s new urban dictionary troll  trisha paytas,NOT,NOT
this is legendairy ,NOT,NOT
i agree there is no real discrimination but i think that family contributes to this gap women are the primary caretakers of children therefore they take more time off work and men as the breadwinners often have to find a second job to support their families i believe there needs to be done to minimize that gap since too many men are experiencing too much stress and too many women are earning less which means also less savings and a smaller pension for them in the future,NOT,NOT
yay this is such heartwarming news,NOT,NOT
they ate men this is bullshit,ABU,NOT

blaire i love you but the cringe is strong with this one will most definitely be buying the pronoun shirt,NOT,NOT
i expceted vox to get this completely wrong,NOT,NOT
the wage gap is just the average meaning its a generalization of the who earns more money key word is earns first of all women work more low paying jobs its not sexist if a women chose to be a nurse and not a engineer nothing is stopping them from choosing to be an engineer in fact they are helped into it by affirmative action if a woman does become an engineer and works less hours it isnt sexist if she is working in a lower paying field like mechanical not civil it is not sexist nothing is holding women back they just dont value money as much as most men they usually prefer a job with more stability rather than a private business if a man is a doctor and a woman is earning less as a nurse they made different life choices it isnt a super natural invisible entity called patriarchy its free choice,NOT,NOT
if u want to lose weight with a vegan diet than keep it clean no processed foods all whole plant based meals,NOT,NOT
i love when femenist say that men steal their jobs then right after they bring out the wage gap if that were the case then why would business even hire men in the first place,NOT,NOT

maybe i am a feminist bc i knew women have it way more harder than men i simply scared of childbirth and pain of period we have to deal it every month and to see men are free from that burden im just jealous like women are more prone to sexual harassment abuse bc women are weaker im sad bc everywhere i only see that women are viewed as sex object when it comes to logical and analytical skills men tends to be more good i sometimes jealous of the boys bc they can understand math and science more quickly than me or sometimes the girls maybe im way too objectify to the genders but idk im just sad why we get all the hard things this is just my thoughts peace i really really want to be a boy lol,NOT,NOT

then again equality doesnt exist,NOT,NOT
it logically makes no sense to have children if we are paid less and treated like second class in our relationships,NOT,NOT
the weaknesses of the video are as follows they still insinuated that discrimination was a factor as they failed to mention otherwise they didnt talk about wage negotiation they neglected to mention that most women choose to raise children and yes there are studies that give a clear indication that both men and women prefer this to working so it is indeed a privilege for women to do so and perhaps most importantly they failed to mention that these industryspecific differences are literally everything to do with specialisation and earned promotion,NOT,NOT

if the gender wage gap had any reasonable meaning companies would increasingly and almost only hire women to lower their wage costs nobody does that therefore closing the gender wage gap is a target entirely based on ideology in particular the premise that men and women are equal in the sense that they should achieve the same income on average this is equal in saying that a construction worker should earn on avg the same income as a stock analyst because they are both humans and therefore equally capable of earning the same the gender wage gap was and still is ideological bullshit,NOT,NOT

jesus these comments are a mess the video is implying that the primary solution lies in incentivizing businesses to give more flexible working hours which is something that can narrow the earnings gap and potentially be better for everyone you dont have to be a diehard feminist to see the logic here in the standard household where women work but also take on a bit more responsibility for childcare the option of say a  shift for mothers means that they can better align their working schedule with childcare it also gives more flexibility to work ot,NOT,NOT

freelee is kinda the reason i stopped eating meat i wasnt really interested or thought about it much until i started seeing all the vegan channels that are starting and everyone was always talking about how freelee is a bitch in the comments of other videos i watched so of course i had to see how much of a bitch she was and stuff she said just kinda made sense you know im not fully vegan but im going to be living on my own soon and buying my own groceries so i plan to make that transition then,NOT,NOT

w let me fry some eggs n steak for this,NOT,NOT
i thought about this for a min in particular the first question especially bc this logic would then apply to other wagegaps whether it ethnicity disabilities age and even something as small as employee physical appearance tall attractive people are statistically paid more so why not hire only short ugly people the reason is people inherently believe that the short ugly female etc person is worse at their jobs and deserves less pay or much more often they believe that the tall attractive white male will do a better job and therefore deserves more basically favouritism so to put it another way the first question implies that the hiring manager knows that a man and woman will perform the same task to the same ability but in reality prejudices impact how they perceive someone completing a task so the hiring manager will believe a white man will and does perform the job better and deserve more compensation,NOT,NOT

lies lies lies,NOT,NOT
i think that firstly there is a huge mix up between the unequal pay for the same job wich is illegal and the gender wage gap the actual ctsdollar wich is a real problem that being said yes it can be explained with the job differences of course there is an explication but the problem is that womens dont actually chose not to be an ingeneer or a computer scientist they are more or less unconsciously banned from those kind of jobs because historicaly these are men jobs and thats exactly what is unfair and what we have to fight against because a women isnt less legitimate to be an ingeneer and neither naturally more skilled to be a nurse btw imo this channel is dangerous because they always avoid the real debate instead they focuse on prooving smthing else which is easier and then claim to have solved the debate,NOT,NOT

i wouldnt say its not fair yeah you won because of that surprise,NOT,NOT
its exactly as she says about how being able to define the gender wage gap is hard to summerise when there are so many contributing factors to these causes of a wage gap other studies show evidence of the gap because of the areas they research the cause of the gap while other studies conclude that there is no gap because of where they focus their research and evidence on its very hard to come to a decision or view point when there are so many contradicting factors to consider,NOT,NOT
i have a big giveaway on my channel go check it out,NOT,NOT
sec  states that any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of section  section  of this title shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than  or to imprisonment for not more than six months or both no person shall be imprisoned under this subsection except for an offense committed after the conviction of such person for a prior offense under this subsection this makes it illegal to pay women less than men based simply off of their gender therefore it makes the entire wage gap idea simply wrong due to this section that came straight out of the equal pay act that was approved by congress in the year of  on june th while the average man is more likely to take more dangerous jobs that offer more money while women are more likely to take less paying jobs such as psychology early education social work human services etc now take note that the wage gap is the average earnings of men and women working fulltime and it doesnt account for different job positions hours worked different jobs or even the same job it just accounts for the overall gain because of this it looks as women are payed less when placing the overall profit of men compared to women because the more dangerous jobs pay more while the ones women are more likely to take areobviously not but hypothetically speaking lets say that women are paid less on average it is said that women make  cents compared to every dollar a man makes which if you do the math can average down to  dollars lost in an average womans lifetime or  dollars each year if this were true then employers would only hire women so they could save  dollars every year that could go to something else would they not business owners arent stupid and they would certainly do almost anything it takes to have extra money in the bank so why arent they simple the wage gap is a myth created by feminists to bolster their sad excuse for a movement,ABU,NOT

see i have trouble with this video it does present facts but is very biased how does pay and bonuses compare between men and women in executive roles how does pay compare between men and women managers and supervisors how does pay compare between men and women in technical fields engineering programming etc really i could probably make a video espousing the benefits of tobacco smoking how it helps focus the mind increases productivity reduces stress in stressful situations is a mild appetite suppressant so can help with weight loss without leading to an eating disorder doesnt cause mental instability like hard drugs do afterwards you might be totally convinced that smoking is amazing at the same time the video would be misleading because it doesnt present the risks of smoking so yeah men and women working in low level jobs are going to be paid the same or are they men tend to gravitate to higher earning jobs and women tend to gravitate to caring jobs but i need to see like for like comparisons in a sample of specific fields before i would be convinced making a video like this is just fluff for sexists and misleading for others,NOT,NOT

one piece of data that i would really like to see is some measure of the actual productivity vs wage gap thing that might be hard to get for some fields but for others like sales or something there ought to be a straightforward way to get actual productivity metrics to compare in order to defeatconfirm the theory that the wage gap is actually due to a performance gap,NOT,NOT

the wage gap was so misrepresented and basically a lie that outlets like vox are trying to salvage any last bit of legitimacy from it the problem is that the implied argument about fairness was never true why because the argument was tried in my view to try and subsidize female workers at the expense of male workers  that was the plan all along  something for nothing,NOT,NOT

to be fair there are misogynist people in some positions of power who tend to not promote women as readily not employ them or discriminate against them in other ways it really does happen and its not a thing that should happen and this could explain parts of a wage gap however most people arent like that and you dont tackle an issue effectively by exaggerating it to the point of absurdity and thus ruining your credibility in the public eye like most feminists these days do,NOT,NOT

freelee look at trishs instagram post about chicken and waffles,NOT,NOT
question whats with the obsession of ending the wage gap as the video outlined its not that women are getting paid less for the same work and instead its more that theyre doing less work or working in lower paying fields this is the outcome of those womens choices they chose to go into that lower paying jobfield and they chose to work less hours so why does it matter why do we have to try and force changes just so the government can look at national earnings of the sexes and see that theyre balanced theres no inherent value to that,NOT,NOT

masculine woman checking in i have had people insist that i should be trans ftm because i like traditionally masculine hobbies like building houses fixing cars hunting etc i dont act girly so for some reason that must mean im trans im not perfectly content with being a woman and it really bothers me when people latch onto things like trans gay etc just to get that boost of popularity that comes with it even had someone insist re demand i not engender my child while i was pregnant with my son i digress people need to stop latching onto buzzwords for their five seconds of fame because it really harms the people who are legitimately trans or gay or whatever they are falsely claiming just my two cents,NOT,NOT
yay trisha im so glad youre going vegan the grapes are good but if you want a significant source of nutrients from them then you probably have to eat like one bag per day so i recommend not making the grapes into a meal but just having a few cups every day as a snack the bananas are good as well very good just make sure you eat them when they ripen because the bananas you showed in the video werent ripe and that amount was good for like one or two days if you really want to go seriously then those will not be enough for one day technically you are supposed to eat at least  bananas a day so take that into mind also freely eats like two or three of those bunches for breakfast the carrots are a good source of vitamin a but you should use those more in cooking than eating them raw just because its better to get all of your carbs in in the morning and then your vegetables are better later in the evening steaming the carrots corn green beans and other vegetables you like and pairing them with brown rice tastes very good watermelons are a good source of vitamin a c and will hydrate you but again the watermelon is better off as a snack and not a meal same with the cantaloupe most of the food you picked out is good for snacking and not really for meals you are going to want to pick up some dates mangoes potatoes brown rice almond milk or any other dairy substitute pasta is good chickpeas and lentils it is definitely recommended you eat raw in the morning and most of the afternoon and then cooked food in the evening if you think eating raw is too hard then just throw it all the fruit you want in a blender add a shit ton of water some almond milk if you want and some coconut sugar if you want also look up vegan recipes you can have for dinner and maybe even some desserts if you want dont worry about overeating as long as you are eating fruits and vegetables because you can have as much as you want without gaining weight of course after eating you will be bloated but it will mostly be water and after urinating your belly will go down its also good if you buy vegan multivitamins meant for vegans because if you are not very educated in nutrition you could end up with deficiencies i recommend the deva oneaday multivitamin  mineral i am glad you are taking this step and remember to eat if you are hungry and dont worry about calory intake you will not gain weight as long as you are eating right and remember always to carb the fuck up,NOT,NOT

welp quit watching after she said if women are paid so much less why dont businesses hire only women buddy friend pal if youre still repeating that nonsense argument you clearly have nothing to contribute women are paid less because their work is valued less than mens therefore businesses dont hire only women because they value womens work less would you hire a bunch of workers you believed are much lower quality workers simply so that you can pay them lower wages if you still lack this basic understanding of what the wage gap is then do not talk to me about why its fake if youre going to argue against something know what it is first sigh,ABU,NOT

im pretty sure that if a women picks a dollar up off the ground that its actually only worth  cents while if it were a man it would be a whole dollar as such i found myself in a particular issue when my  year set of twins  male  female brought up the wage gap difference to fix this i found that the average  tooth fairy gift per tooth would be balanced by my daughter being provided more coins to equal the values they are both super happy that i had talked to the tooth fairy for them the tooth fairy tends to leave a little extra though providing the  for my daughter while this is a little more than the proper balance of money from the wage gap which my son isnt too okay with i see no problems with it when they get older and i have to pay them to clean their rooms ill probably end up doing the same thing as the tooth fairy that way everything is fair,NOT,NOT

nice and eyeopening thanks im also years late but apparently thats how youtube recommendations work on the other hand even if  of the worse paying majors were male i still would like to see teachers early childhood educators included psychologist and social workers earn more there is no sexism in this wish either just the thing that these people do a lot to individuals and in my opinion should be valued more this claim that women chooose to study things that lead to lower wages sounded a bit like blaming women for earning averagely somewhat less but then who would do these jobs also if some men didnt do the dangerous jobs who would trust me there are men who would never work on an oil rig and there are women who would never even touch an elderly gentleman or lady or care for them professionally if they cant do this on their own i forgot the word for the home where they live then no i do not compare these jobs and you should neither do that because they are enterily different and not comparable i would like to add the situation in my country beginner teachers earn circa  usd per month without the taxes nurses or social workers who work with the elderly or homeless for example earn even less i now simply dont trust my owm calculations because it seems so few like  dollarshour compared to american wages yes things are a bit cheaper there and we have free universities but my point is that these people do not earn enough money regardless of their gender edit for correction of sentencestructures i struggle with english,NOT,NOT

the sex based pay gap is a lie the inference by feminists is that a man and a woman working side by side doing the same job dont get paid equally that is a lie the pay gap is an average of all male and female workers across all careers the reason men as a whole make more than women as a whole is simple you dont see as many women choosing to work dangerous demanding hazardous jobs how many maternity ward nurses are dying from black lung like coal miners do how many social workers are  week long shifts non stop like oil rig workers or working construction on buildings with only a harness for    weeks without break men also tend to work more hours every week so obviously theyd be paid more equal pay isnt possible unless theres equal effort so ladies if you want the pay gap to decrease stop going to school to be a florist and join a fire academy otherwise shut the hell up and stop saying things like being a mother is the hardest job in the world if you can do your job in your pajamas then no its not the hardest job in the world,NOT,NOT

coming from a genderfluid person to me it sounds like she might be genderfluid or maybe nonbinary also people using the pronoun they dont have disassociate personality disorder i use theythem pronouns personally for several reasons  it feels a lot more neutral to me and i prefer that sometimes people using her and he make me feel highly uncomfortable and i know its not right so i use theythem because i feel like it fits me more also they is used as a singular pronoun a lot in english when you dont know someones gender you use theythem like if someone said oh its my friends birthday today a perfectly normal response would be oh tell them i said happy birthday ergo theythem can be used as a singular pronoun and a lot of people feel more comfortable with that and thats aokay,NOT,NOT
this is a very misleading video and clearly has a lot of the people in the comments confused first off the title of this video is clearly wrong within the video it states that there is a wage gap but that it is produced by choice from this position you must then ask why women are choosing lower paid jobs there are multiple answers to this firstly the patriarchal society in which we live has tended to pay male dominated industries more this is not necessarily because these industries are of more value it is due to unions and wage debates over decades secondly women are told from a young age that they will be a nurse teacher or any other female dominated industry this is through all kinds of life also the idea that women should be the ones looking after a child are outdated this is a joint task for both parents,NOT,NOT

this video is misinformed and misconstrues a georgetown study titled women cant win despite making educational gains and pursuing highwage majors women still earn less than men to manipulate its audience one main finding of the study is discrimination even when women do everything rightchoose a highpaying field of study pursue a highpaying major within that field and get a job in a highpaying occupationwomen still get paid less than their male peers if a man and woman who are equally qualified get the same job the woman still only earns  cents for every dollar the man is paidmore than cents to be sure but a far cry from earnings equality to not include this principal finding of the  page study is disrespectful to the truth of the gender wage gap which might not be that every woman earns  cents to every  dollar a man earns but it still exists at a  cent deficit according to the sited georgetown study shame to prageru for disrespecting the truth and mission of this study spreading factually incorrect data with conviction and manipulating its millions of viewers,NOT,NOT

trisha really seems to struggle with her identity i dont know her or her content that well only hear about her a little from emelia fart and shane dawson but from what ive seen im thinking she might have histrionic personality disorder  as i cant comment on bpd seeing as how i dont know how much she fears abandonment maybe someone can inform me on that trisha definitely shows signs of radical attention seeking behavior and seductive mannerisms she covers quite a few of the symptoms of a histrionic cant take criticism well had a breakdown because ethan from hh goofed a little bit on her seems to make rash decisions now she believes shes trans which isnt something anyone should take that lightly being overly concerned with physical appearance even though here she claims she walks around wearing no makeup but thats moreso when shes alone which is different etc cant say for sure though since i dont watch her content directly nor do i know her personally she does generally give me a bad vibe like i can tell i wouldnt want to meet her in person ever,NOT,NOT

simple truth men in same jobs do not make same pay either this is fact this is called negotiation men do not force their employers to pay equal to compensate for their varying negotiating ability save for strikes and union representation if women want true equality they just have to learn to negotiate better without coercion of the law or using their feminine character in any way learn to play the game they so desperately wish to a be a part of in a truly fair way,NOT,NOT
why dont women just have less kids i dont think any would really mind if a family has one or two children instead of  or three children also women with a lot of kids almost never work if you have three kids then u really shouldnt expect to go back to work until right around when the gap shrinks again,NOT,NOT

whats a crow mukbang,NOT,NOT
i am not a feminist and this video does set some facts but without drawing the conclusions from them i have to say that  as a woman i observe that men are sometimes if not regularly macho towards women even in a way that they may perceive as normal or harmless i dont believe its always purposely mean but therefore they do not respect women entirely while its much more more rare that a woman would have any kind of despise towards men just for being men women usually value men as much as themselves  if its true that women often make choices that lead them to less well payed jobs its partly because they are surrounded by social messages that tell them some jobs are for men and they wouldnt fit in it im not saying its caused by all men nor that all women suffer from it but its true for a certain prcrentage of people and may explain the unexplained wage gap in this video which is ridiculously presented as unexplained while the answer is im sorry quite obvious and quite real once again im not saying that women are all oppressed by men but men make the more social oppression as they make the more sexual assaults take this as a remark from someone who doesnt care about gender when looking at someone but about respect and truth,NOT,NOT
as a gay man i dont find this offensive i just see a person explaining how they feel and just trying to figure out their identity as a person,NOT,NOT

yaay it might be hard for some to flip a switch and go vegan but since youre so determined to do this lifestyle for the next two weeks and hopefully enjoy it and continue it can be made simple eat enough calories please do to get the full satisfying experience of feeding your body the healthiest and foods in abundance watch the oil you can easily replace oils with water and its literally the same effect with less grease  just because its vegan doesnt mean its healthy i know vegan cookies are a temptation but make sure to eat clean and by that i mean eat simple use youtuber mommytang for some awesome simple vegan food ideas im so proud of you for doing this and i hope everything goes amazing,NOT,NOT
omg im so happy shes becoming vegan,NOT,NOT
sorry to say it but this will never stop simply because we have opened pandoras box and told people that they can basically do and be whatever they want and its acceptable so why wouldnt they cross this line its a matter of time before transgender men start going into the wnba those poor girls dont stand a chance and that sucks,ABU,NOT
yes trish finally i am so proud of you dont listen to the haters you can do this i believe in you eat lots of plant starches and dont worry about protein if you feel you need more protein i recommend the spicy chicken boca burgers theyre soooo good keep researching online watch freelees videos watch earthlings watch bite sized vegans videos keep doing that research girl you got this,NOT,NOT
the wage gap has been reduced since  thats a given noone claimed there to be a  wage gap in  in fact back then the wage gap was closer to  to  on a long term effect laws and policies have lowered the gap considerably you can argue that women have different jobs than men but the fact is that they dont work  less hours so they shouldnt be paid  less regardless of what their occupation is you see the exact same thing when you compare the  poorest americans with the other  of americans the hour difference is nowhere near being equal to the wage difference,NOT,NOT

awesome work pbn question what  biggest environmental studies ed referred to,NOT,NOT
it is always entertaining the mental gymnastics the trans youtubers present males impersonate females and want to date males  the shortcut is they are actually gay females impersonate males and want to date females  the shortcut is they are actually lesbians the idea that children are born with an innate gender identity which develops prenatally and is impervious to environmental influence is not supported by any credible science body and brain are interconnected scientists have found no separate innate gender area of the brain which is fixed at birth childrens brains are very plastic they develop through interaction with people and the environment and they are constantly absorbing information and influences which shape them,NOT,NOT
its cause they werent counting ethots,NOT,NOT
this is actually a pretty fair treatment of the gender wage gap the disparity certainly does exist but its cause is rooted primarily in the different life decisions men and women make namely child care as this video suggests  not misogyny which is what many mainstream feminists would have us believe,NOT,NOT

no one gets to be right all the time that being said let us pretend for a minute that a job interview is happening where the choice has not already been made about who will be getting the job long before the first interview was even held because some of the same qualities which men use to get ahead in business are discouraged in women within the business environment women do not have the same bargaining power over wages which men have during an interview for a new job the interviewer does not ever offer up front the maximum amount of money that the business has set aside which they can afford to pay the new employee men can bargain more from a position of strength to get that higher wage because this behavior is acceptable for men if a woman ever wants to be guaranteed she will be paid what is right for her skills education level and qualifications then she has to start her own business ladies christy wright has started a program called business boutique which is all about teaching women how to start and run their own business google her online for more information here is your way to get paid what you want hire who you want and set their wages fairly i hope you compete some of these other businesses right out of business,NOT,NOT

youre setting a terrible example for the trans community outsiders see crazy people like you and think everyone is like that,NOT,NOT
the main reasons theres a wage gap between men and women  women have more paid time off work compared to men when they have children this creates a debt to the companies that pay them  more women leave work or reduce their hours to spend more time in a homemaker role compared to men making it difficult for firms to earn back the extra debt that women create compared to men meaning that women are taxed as a gender to pay back the debt that is created by the entire gender which is also why the wage gap closes towards their later years because they can put more time into work instead of homemaking  men are more competitive and aggressive due to our naturally higher testosterone levels which means men are more likely to take risks apply for the higher paid jobs more productive in highly stressful work environments more likely to have the skills for senior level positions and are wayyy better at asking and negotiating pay rises not saying women cant do these things just a higher proportion of men are capable of it than women,NOT,NOT

copied from chris does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didnt watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work eg business this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men  women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesnt account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from    men earned more out the gate  its a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from  all the way back to  i mean really  the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their s and s was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument  if you look at women born  same thing for women    if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument   these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women arent payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument   if you dont show up for work or cant work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesnt have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her  i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in  so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women arent paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they werent but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women the simple answer is no btw i cited every source i could in your video every point i made has your quotes and even the video times you quoted a lot of studies is it that hard too add them too the description,NOT,NOT

this is correct very good explanation vox but dont call it a wage gap because its an earnings gap two different things,NOT,NOT
the salary gap is affected by the choices of individuals so we must ask ourselfs what is driving each sex towards specific career paths im not satisfied with the simple awnser that the gender gap just cant be explain and that it simply is there are various factors that can be properly studied social standarscultural customs  companies and countries policies  so maybe in order to explain what drieves people to make certain decitions we have to look at theyre surroundings and see if there is were the problem lies,NOT,NOT

glad to see a left channel acknowledging that the wage gap is a choice by women through the careers they work and their choice to have children rather then systemic sexism where employers intentionally pay women less which believe it or not a lot of leftists and sjws believe,NOT,NOT
vox will make a five and a half minute video to sustain a feminist myth its an earnings gap and notice how they never compare people working the same jobs for the same employers yet youll never see a video about how theres only about an  disparity between men and women in being the recipient domestic abuse which is actually likely much less considering men are far less likely to report not to mention many care facilities for domestic abuse victims will turn male victims away simply on the basis of sex then theres also the rate of male rape victims and female theyre extraordinarily close hardly anyone in the media spotlight talks about that certainly not vox or on the subject of work itself how women have two to one odds to men for being chosen for stem fields in the name of equality plus we have built educational programs to encourage women into fields like physics science and math i can tell you with certainty that men do not receive these support systems also most important of all wage discrimination is made constitutionally illegal by the th amendment and reaffirmed by equal rights of the s also maybe this thing called evolutionary biology puts women in the role of primary cause y know theyre the ones popping out the babies if you want to be seen as a credible news organization vox then tell the full story and maintain some ethics in reporting,NOT,NOT

although im a total left winger i enjoy listening to prageru because at least they say it in an intelligent way and it forces me to develop a smarter rebuttal if i cant then i tend to agree with it the problem with people now days is that people only listen to what they want to hear and become very polarized i recommend watching vox videos if you are willing to do the same as me im sure right wing media makes the left wing sound stupid and vise versa but you look at educated thoughts on both sides neither sound as stupid,NOT,NOT
i reaaallllyyy want to go vegan but idk how because none of my family is vegan and im not exactly old enough to buy my own groceries yet i suggested it to my mom and she wasnt exactly open to the idea because it was an expensive diet any suggestions or ideas,NOT,NOT

so i came across this term  which i had to look up transmasculine it refers to a cis female who expresses herself with traits normaly considered maleish so im personally not sure if this is a legitimate nonbinary gender but if it is considered to be and nonbinary is included under the umbrella transgender or is it the other way around  then this trish certainly has a legitimate case for being transgender,NOT,NOT
its not surprising this obvious propaganda works on braindeads the culling will be swift and without mercy,NOT,NOT
does anyone know what happened to freelees instagram,NOT,NOT
i dont care what she said in that video but if you or anyone else say that trisha isnt trans that is horrible we dont know what is in her mind you of all people what if i told you no you are not trans nope you need mental help,NOT,NOT
why do they have to eat around the bush why cant they just say it is due to flexbility of the hours they kepts getting me lost,NOT,NOT
bruh isnt this when she did  becoming shane dawson vid lmao,NOT,NOT

check out  they have bomb vegan recipies,NOT,NOT
i commented once before and its going to sound like im saying this hostile and im not at all but you telling her how this works how a transgender should be where you have stated in a past video you still have your penis and what have you down there because you would mourn the loss so does that mean youre not fully transgender you still want to hold on to some male parts because you would mourn the loss so obviously you dont know exactly how it works either i dont either but apparently its still open for debate what transgender is and what it isnt and how many genders there are so again not with any animus at all here but who gives you the right to say shes not doing it right and youre doing it right not a hater just wondering why you feel youre an expert at it because you have a lot of followers would love to hear a true answer and not somebody cussing me out you want to be accepted like everyone else and be a normal person i got it but here youre squashing someone else who obviously is got issues and isnt dealing with it well but at least trying to express it i dont think you should be jumping down on a lost soul what gives you the right to say  what the fuck thats not how it works  ,NOT,NOT

maybe because men are going out of their way to work constantly and goes to work despite being hurt or sick theyre natural leaders and theyre always trying to do the best women have the potential they just dont go for the job that men go for,NOT,NOT
im going to cry am so happy omg i love you trishaw for doing this subbing again,NOT,NOT
thats amazing trish  freelee does a raw til  diet so she eats tons of raw fruits and veggies for breakfast and lunch and does light exercise and then eats a cooked dinner after  you can eat as many fruits and veggies as you want but beware of vegan junk food try to not eat after  and hydrate some meat and dairy alternatives to eat in moderation that are amazing are chao cheese gardein chicken and almost anything from starbucks without whipped cream java chips and with soy or coconut milk as a substitute i love you trishy and im so psyched youre joining the vegan family keep up your fiber and protein rice and beans for days smash in the fruit girl i hope you love your two week vegan experience and it becomes a longterm thing its not a diet its a lifestyle but it also doesnt have to take over your life ,NOT,NOT

lol gender wage gap is fake because if women got payed less than men for the same job theyd fire all the men,NOT,NOT
male logic translation women make choices that affect their income negatively while men do whatever it takes to clime the corporate ladder the wage gap is a myth here is proof if you are a ceo and you can hire women at  cents on the hour to the dollar an hour a man works for the same output in labor who will you hire if you want to get rich the answer will always be the woman since she is cheaper labor that is simple economics folks the reason that woman are not dominating the workforce because of this logical choice is because they make decisions that adversely affect their work performance taking time off to raise kids and inflexible schedules is bad for business so you make less for those reasons ladies no man is oppressing you you did it to yourselves so maybe quit blaming your bad choices on men ok also just so we are clear paying a woman less for the same work is discrimination and there are laws against it since you never hear of women winning lawsuits then these companies obviously are not in violation of said law so your wage gap argument is invalid,NOT,NOT

 gigi girl what are you doing that hat and scarf tho ,NOT,NOT
poor trish shes gonna get so much hate when she posts a video of herself eating meat,NOT,NOT
why is there a wage gap at all simple women make decisions that man cannot do women get pregnant men dont so they can continue to work unimpeded for the next  months even if they dont get pregnant women overall have more health concerns that take them away from work and another reason men make more is because various jobs often tend to use money to incentivize people to take them its why men dominate the careers that tend to expose oneself to unsanitary filthy disgusting conditions the most dangerous jobs in the nation are overwhelmingly male,NOT,NOT
finally im so happy,NOT,NOT
why do those on the right hate the idea of equal rights that includes hating feminism there is a gender wage gap even this video has to admit it,NOT,NOT
prageru is part of the misogynist patriarchy,NOT,NOT
theres a clever linguistics trick at around  she says the wage gap shrinks when we account for choice and then says the remaining  is due to choice that doesnt actually logically follow and the fact that such a blatant error made it through scripting performing and editing says that it was likely deliberate,NOT,NOT
it seems the two sides are talking past each other again even after explaining why the gender gap is there is clearly still a conversation to be had why is this the case that women are making these choices to be less prosperous then men and what role socialization has to do with it this problem however is a whole different problem from the original idea of women being paid less for the same work and has different implications still running back to the  wage gap buzzphrase is irresponsible and really the words coming out of peoples mouths should be more something along the lines of women are living less prosperously and ambitiously then men what could the implications of this be,NOT,NOT
the wage gap is what we call a myth,NOT,NOT
as a trans person i find this disrespectful tbh,NOT,NOT
i personally connect with some of what that chick is saying though calling herself trans no its like she is rubbing the fact shw is born the gender she identifies as in the faces of every trans person basically luaghing at their struggle i share some of the same feelings she mentions i often fantasize about being male however i am happy with my gender so no way can i call myself trans that chick definitely trolling or she really believes she is if the latter she has some unknown issue that hasnt been discovered and given a name yet,NOT,NOT
it really is a simple issues genetically they are males no matter how they feel or think they feel the science say they are if you have to get your prostate checked at  then you are still male bottom line i dont understand where the confusion lye in this situations those two should not be competing with girls,ABU,ABU

freelee i have a question how does it feel to be the coolest vegan ever,NOT,NOT
its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,NOT,NOT
this is what antifeminists have been saying all along the earnings gap exists because women choose lower paying fields and work fewer hours than men it has nothing to do with discrimination it has nothing to do with sexism if a woman chooses to have children it will hurt her earnings potential that is just a fact of life women are free to make this choice no one is forcing it upon them,NOT,NOT
unfortunately trisha is being a troll im so confused how people still even find her relevant this is exactly what she wanted everyone to do she has admitted so many times that she says these things to be a troll and have people make these videos and certainly not saying you shouldnt have bc i love all of your videos im just glad you uploaded anything lmao but i wish people would stop giving her what she wants so she can just sink into her vile little hole shes not a good person imo,ABU,NOT

game changers really changed my view of veganism and having a more plant based diet hopefully ill slowly transition to a more plant over red meat diet i tried watching the doc dominion too but it was so disgusting and horrible i couldnt take it in a way the meat industry takes money from people without them knowing that it will heighten cholesterol worsen their heart condition and more thank you vegans for doing what you are doing hopefully i can join you guys this year so sick of red meat,NOT,NOT

yes trisha im so excited for you the tips that i have are definitely get in those fruits ands veg  they contain mostly water and they are low calorie so you can eat a lot of them and feel full for a longer amount of time but dont for get about your rice and potatoes to get protein i would recommend lentils chick peas tofu you can season and cook it all sorts of ways oh and you need to try nice cream its a must all that it is is bananas and non dairy milk just put  bananas in a food processor with a splash of milk and blend it up my last tip you just to look on youtube and the internet search for vegan meal inspo hot for food is a great channel to look at and if youre scared of gaining weight just really listen to your body eat when youre hungry and then dont over eat and make sure its still clean foods i hope this helps i know its a little rambley,NOT,NOT

goddamn you even eat chickfila fabulously,NOT,NOT
this video is confusing to say the least but what she says makes some sense if we look at this from a crossdreamer perspective a lot of trans people live and present as their assigned gender even if their real identity is trans or nonbinary there are good and bad reasons for why they do so but the fact that they are not transitioning does not make them less trans her frustration of being a gay man in a womans body reflects the kind of pain many nontransitioning trans people feel i guess some will dismiss the whole idea as preposterous given her extreme femme appearance but many trans people make desperate attempts at living up to the stereotypes trying to fit in kirsten beck was a bearded navy seal fighting in afghanistan before she gave up fighting herself moreover characteristics like femme and butch are not restricted to one gender after all these were terms created in the lesbian community i dont know if trisha is trans but she deserves the chance to find out for herself,NOT,NOT

actually its all women and all men including those that dont work it also doesnt factor in anything from maternal leave to hours worked to length of career the study is just a statistic of what every woman in the us earns averaged out vs what ever man in the us earns averaged out including those that make billions and those that dont earn a nickle factoring those in tends to result in a lot of fields where women are payed vastly more than men perhour,NOT,NOT
who is the comedian ,NOT,NOT

i am a vegetarian going vegan because of you freelee baby steps baby steps thank you so much i am exited for my new and healthy life style i used to not agree with you and hate you but now i love you so much and i realized your message to people and i love your message i am extremely sorry for me hate comment on one of your videos i dont remember which video it was though thank you sooooooooooo much,NOT,NOT
freelee is such a beautiful person inside and out all she wants to do is help this world,NOT,NOT
so basically women arent paid less rather they work less hours and therefore earn less than someone who can work more hours seems fair enough  why does this need changing,NOT,NOT
i really like the last sentence u dont have to like u have to hear me ccuz sometimes i do like and sometimes i dont but its abot the message so it doesnt matter,NOT,NOT
good for you trish i wish u all the very best in this dont stress if u slip up cos its all part of the change u will master it in no time im sure and will have a tone of energy too and feel great also ive been vegan for   years now and am the healthiest ive ever been i never get sick and i caught a cold early this winter cos its winter in aus and it was like nothing and only lasted about a week anyway i make pizzas sushi pasta dishes rice dishes and chips and loads of fruit i havent missed dairy or junk in ages lfhc is the trcik as freelee has probably told u already but yeah just love rt its awesome dont be scared about the as many calories as you want thing it works,NOT,NOT

nah u both guys gtfo,ABU,NOT
sad as hell,NOT,NOT
all you and freelee do is throw shade at each other and now you love her,NOT,NOT
so if transgenderism has nothing at all to do with sexstereotypes aka gender which is literally centred around the concepts of man  masculine and woman  feminine then why cant trish be a trans man who enjoys the sexstereotype of femininity why should she cut her hair males can have long hair right why should any trans people do anything at all to their appearance in order to align with the sexstereotype of the sex they identify as make it make sense,NOT,NOT
overtime weekends afterhour calls hazard pay flex time negotiating pay raises desire for pay raises over gaining benefits,NOT,NOT
i want to go vegan but idk how to tell my parents,NOT,NOT
you can do it trish potatoes rice dominos vegan pizza chao cheese perfect for grilled cheeses and sandwiches you can have everything you want dont limit yourself to just fruits or you will screw up eat cookies and salads anything do your research it girl,NOT,NOT
listen to the distant screeches of the special snowflakes as they sprint here as fast as their chubby legs can carry them,NOT,ABU
this is actually a gender gap because those numbers reveal that women in general tend to have a lower position than men in a work place women earn less even with a proper education and the same performance as their male colleagues,NOT,NOT
one more comment female dominated jobs seem to reflect females natural abilities as a result of having babies unfortunately when a couple ie a male and a female decides to have children it is usually the females job that is sacrificed why because the males job pays more was it the females choice alone to have children so why does it always seem the female takes the hit careerwise,NOT,NOT
i dont get what she means when she first says that when you account for different choices women and men make the wage gap shinks to  c and than she says that this gap that does exist is again due to differnt choices that doesnt really make sence does it,NOT,NOT
 why is science so far into the left i thought science related jobs had good pay,NOT,NOT
im very much about bbs and i love showing them off im sorry no trans man would ever say that i know tons of fem trans guys but none of them would use that word to talk about their chest i used to love trish but this is wild love you review sex toys in lingerie but the fact that you talk about all of the ftm partners you have had makes it sound like its just sexualized to you or a fetish this is seriously going to do more damage to the trans community than jonathan yaniv the you can be whatever gender you want comment especially pissed me off because that makes trans seem like a choice nobody would choose that i dont want anyone thinking that i think this because she is feminine but the fact that she always has her chest out and id very confident about her body body positivity is awesome but no trans man would do that okay this rant is over im sorry it was all over the place though nobody is gonna read this far lol,NOT,NOT
so fucking proud of you you bamf,NOT,NOT
i dont really think there is a wage gap in the way people think i think men earn their increased pay compared to a woman unless its an exceptional case of a boss or manager who is truly sexist butthere is a deeper problem women are led to believe they are weaker too emotional and too volatile all their lives women dont just compete against men but they also compete against women lots of women in power seem to see themselves as an exception and supporting another woman is threatening to their perceived special position as a woman so the wage gap ends up being because women are not striving as high as men but a lot of it is because of psychological manipulation to believe they arent good enough,NOT,ABU

according to the broadcast why is womens soccer so white one of the main reasons for it is that that these youth players are preferring to play for clubs rather than just to play high school soccer they see the need to play for clubs because since the womens soccer is not as major as for the mens soccer team despite of how well they perform as compared to the men it was mentioned that some clubs were as high as  per teenage girl when we compare national team clubs to high school soccer it is notable that not everyone will have that type of money to pay for their girls to go off to play it all has to do with socioeconomic and the parents who have this type of money due to their higher incomes are white thus this is one big reason why there is so little diversity in the womens soccer team shifting to the video there is no gender gap the overall message is that there is only a  wage gap and not more as others make it seem they mention how basically it is the womens fault because of their career options which impacts how much money they make however what they dont realize is that out of all the job options they have there is only  of jobs that pay women and men equal so how are they expected to choose wisely when there is hardly any options for them to choose from it is sad to see how even with the same education the gap still remains just because women are seen as less reliant because they are not able to work at all times due to motherhood and all the other household responsibilities women have on top of work they mention how it is not sexism but all of the previous states otherwise how men are more capable of doing certain jobs and they are less of a burden for employers moreover according to adams et al of section  classism womens average pay is at  of mens compensation throughout their whole career women only make  of what men make it was mentioned in the reading how discrimination is part of it but also because women are not always able to work the full time and thus if you need to be absent for a period of time from work it is a stiff penalty in declining their career and slashing the pay the lack of daycare and flexible job options makes it really hard for a woman to work the same amount of hours as a man overall i think it is important to analyze this further and note how it is not that they are not telling us the truth or they are doing bad math they are sharing the actual facts and truth on what women have to deal with,NOT,NOT
i stopped eating meat  years ago and i dropped  pounds in a month i didnt starve myself or exercise like crazy it just fell off of me i went vegan over a month ago and suddenly my skinny jeans are now to big on me lol,NOT,NOT

i am not a feminist and i actually really liked this video i think the best part was you gave a somewhat practical solution to a practical problem i wish more left leaning progressives would do that because i might actually join them at that point the biggest problem with progressivism is that their best answer to problems usually revolves around cultural change or societal change society and culture are peoples responses to the world around them its not just a dial you can turn to your liking the only real way you can change a culture or society is by forcing people against their will to believe your ideology which historically is best done through a freedomless totalitarian government like stalin or hitler,NOT,NOT

i think what most are missing from this video is that the wage gap is inherently caused by culture and the disproportionate effect children have on women vs men the wage gap problem is an apples to oranges issue because its caused by forces primarily outside of the workplace but we see its effects as the average wages between men and women what vox is trying to say is that to fix this inequality we should approach it by giving women more opportunities to balance this extra demand placed on them or some how alleviate it through policy whether its better childcare maternity and paternity leave to allow the father more time to help or more flexible work hours its not about trying to pay women more to compensate but by giving them the tools to be on an equal footing which i think we can all agree with,NOT,NOT
this video makes me ashamed to be trans gtfo trisha you toxic asf,ABU,NOT
feminists bitch about being paid less than men okay well maybe if you got a job in any of the fields that men typically work in eg mining construction railroads etc then you would have the same pay rate i dont think that some lady who works at a hotel reception or hair salon should make the same as a man who is up to his elbows in shit to fix a broken pump at a sewage treatment plant,ABU,NOT

im so sick of hearing so much about the wage gap the only reason why there is a wage gap is because women are usually the ones that take care of the kids and then when the women go back to work when they are  they are starting a new job so they obviously dont get paid as much as the guy thats been working that same job for  years its not a wage gap its a gap between new workers and experienced workers my parents were both engineers working for the same company in the same job and my mom made less money than my dad purely because she was  years behind in experience,NOT,NOT

this video needs to be shown to someone who thinks the gender wage gap is real,NOT,NOT
 this video specifically asserts that there is not a a wage discrepancy due to sexism or anything like that  this video attributes the cause of what wage discrepancy to the different occupations women choose to take  this video recognizes that women are more likely to raise children and does not suggest that this should change  this video acknowledges that as jobs become more flexible child care becomes less of a conflict and thus narrows the otherwise natural gap  this video does not suggest that anything needs to be done other than maybe encourage possibilities that make occupations more versatile they dont argue that any sexism exists in the first place to fix but merely that the wage gap will disappear as jobs become more flexible come on people if you want to argue against the ignorance spouted about how sexist the world is make sure that youre actually targeting the right things if anything this video attacks the fallacy of the  cents figure,NOT,NOT

in order to conclude that the wage gap is a problem you have to start with the presupposition that  the only thing people care about is money and  women have no will of their own and are simply puppets subjected to the world men choose for them,NOT,NOT
facts are mostly correct but the main question remains  why are those choices what women choose its because society doesnt provide a level playing field for women the expectation especially from the right is that women should take care of the children and thus make all the sacrifices,ABU,NOT
theres one more important point here the cost of employment over a year career who takes more days off whos more likely to need a long leave of absence who does the school call when they need a parent for a sick child i think if you threw in this factor you would find that  gap,NOT,NOT
this aint it chief,NOT,NOT
if they have a penis then they should run against others with a penis case closed,ABU,ABU
this is a great and much needed video but we should make working times more flexible just to shrink the wage gap but instead to help a lot of peoples mental health as jobs with long working hours are largely responsible for stuff like depression anxiety and so on so we should be focusing more on that as it will also help shrink the wage gap as well,NOT,NOT
so the pay gap is basically between mom and others then isnt the issue when women get pregnant women have no other choice but take care of kids and work less while men have no choice but work harder if there is more support for working moms such as childcare and paternity leave this situation will be better,NOT,NOT

i wouldnt exactly say that you can eat as much as you want without gaining weight or even for weight loss normally the amount you want to eat is equal the amount you need if you dont have disordered eating habit though if you have been restricting for so long then you might want to eat more than you need which results in gaining weight but this shouldnt scare you off since you need your body to gain that weight in order to cure the metabolic damage and increase your basal metabolic rate and eventually youll be at an optimal weight for your body type hope this was helpful ,NOT,NOT

for making going vegan a bit easier just check out recipes from hot for food minimalist baker and marys test kitchen their recipes will give you a shit ton of inspiration and just so yummy also since you live in america it will be so easy for you because  their are a shit ton a restaurant and cafes that you can just eat at when u dont want to cook and  their are so many mock meats and yoghurt and mock stuff that taste great if you ever crave anything you can just buy a great substitute or find in a vegan restaurant or just cook it you have so many options it should be pretty easy biggest tip you have to eat a bit more then usual because vegan food is less caloricly dense most of the time you dont even have to change ur diet if you dont want to its just the art of substitution if you had like a yoghurt for breakfast just eat a vegan one or a breakfast sandwich you can make a vegan one or most probably buy one ok hope this helps sorry that this so long ,NOT,NOT

getting better and better every year thanks for another great video pbn,NOT,NOT
girl you took the bait,NOT,NOT
literally the ad before this video was degree for women and had some girl in a suit prepping in front of the mirror going to confront her boss about her male colleague making more than her and then it ended with a slogan about closing the wage gap this was a good video but i wish you had been more critical of the major public figures who purport the wage gap to be something it fundamentally it is not overt discrimination against women when its more about lifestyle choices,NOT,NOT
i live for your videos youre so blunt and real with everyone and its so fucking refreshing big fan keep the videos coming love you,NOT,NOT
the main argument here is that the wage gap exists because women do more housework and childcare duties therefore they cant focus on their careers as much as a man who does less childcare and housework the problem with this is that it assumes women are forced into this role by the patriarchy and they dont want to be the main childcare provider by their own choice which is largely not true of course there are individual situations where it may be the case that the man wants to do more or equal childcare to the woman and that couple is free to factor that into the way they situate their lives which im sure does happen already but by and large most women prefer to do more of the childcare and let the man do more of the breadwinning so they can spend their time with their child while theyre growing up and less slaving away at work while the child is with a someone else and both parents are doing this willingly as what they see as the best way to raise the child and of course no one wants to do housework generally speaking but whoever is home more will obviously be the one to do more housework in this case women are home more so they end up doing more im a woman in a thankfully childless relationship with a man and i make more and therefore he does more housework and takes care of the animals where as most of my coworkers who are nearly all female mothers prefer to work less and stay home with their kids like i described and i am an exception of sorts also the single mom issue is a totally separate situation that wasnt addressed in this video and i will say that they tend to be royally screwed because they cant focus all their time on children or on their careers which is why a free to hire government salary nanny would be a great thing to incorporate into the usa basing it off of how its done in france that way the single moms pay wouldnt go right back into baby sitting while theyre trying to make a profit on top of all their other bills and expenses that come with children,NOT,NOT
you know what i would call this a tom boy somtimes and a girl girl sometimes because what i heard was you like man hair and being a little more guy ish but maybe thats just me i hope you can figure it out t i really hope you find someone you care about and they care and except you ,NOT,NOT
discussing what a mess they are not chicks with dicks they are dudes with dicks,ABU,ABU
this video has a point but it doesnt tell the whole story often traditionally female fields are paid less because they are mostly women also women are less likely to ask for a pay raise partially bc they are more likely to be looked on as pushy or aggressive than a man would be it is often harder for women to get to higher level positions that pay more because they arent viewed as as good leaders and male bosses and even as a few studies have shown other women may discriminate against women when giving promotions many high paying male dominated fields also have problems with sexual harassment silicon valley is a good example which obviously discourages female workers the problem is not companies deliberately paying women less it is that it is harder for women to get into higher paying fields,NOT,NOT

everything christina said was true unfortunately she did not address the issue that many have with the gender wage gap the choices themselves why dont women pursue stem careers as much as men telling girls that they are discriminated against is definitely counterproductive but actively encouraging them to pursue these types of interests is necessary since they are unlikely to have female role models in these fields no women dont want to get paid the same to do social work as a petroleum engineer they want to be given every opportunity to become a petroleum engineer that a man has please check your privilege before discounting this statement,NOT,NOT

you know what i like this video its not just some ignorant feminists saying we earn less because sexism i tend to take arguments in which certain properties of a group of people are the focus rather than their defining qualities here they dont say women earn less because sexism but rather that women earn less because they take different jobs or that women and men in the same field dont make as much because women tend to work less or care more for children  and what not good job vox youre actually educating people,NOT,NOT

you bastards got it all wrong you guys are a bunch of feminists looking for something to go on with your agenda you are retarded and the wage gap has been illegal since  you dont take in mind that generally woman work less hours take more days off go to lower paying jobs also men for example have higher times in jail and have a higher suicide rate along with higher deaths at jobs not to mention that a lot of triggered feminists cause men even if the didnt and then ruin there lives in fact woman are probably more privileged then men i could go on for ever to be honest,ABU,NOT

you know i would hazard a guess that the reason women take lower paying jobs and work shorter less consistent hours is because of the social pressure and gender roles that dictate that they should females are encouraged to take lower paying professions because those professions are often more traditionally feminine typically female dominated areas will probably seem safer for women to take and typically male dominated areas will seem safer for men to take women may work fewer hours because they are expected to care for any children children they are expected to have,NOT,NOT

im very tired as of now and what im getting out of this is that most women who are earning less are doing so because many of them have children to take care of so theyre missing hours the solution is that work hours could be made more flexible is that what shes saying here if so couldnt a better solution be to raise the wage of women with children who are singleunsupported please note that i am not very educated in this field so im just making a solution based on what ive observed from this video p,NOT,NOT

first of all if you know trisha you know that she is definitely just shitposting and unfortunately for her its completely blown up and gone too far and now shes cant turn back without being completely cancelled second of all i find it shocking the way the lgbtq community prestigious members of the community have reacted to the news the way most people have reacted to her completely contradicts to what they normally preach about transgender people they will allow predators to convince themselves and others that they can get periods and pms even though they have male genitalia  but when a known troll comes out suddenly theyre offended i know trisha just as well as the next person but what if she actually does have gender dysphoria and this is how the hypocrites that are social justice warriors react if anything shes exposing the hypocrisy within the lgbtq online community,NOT,NOT

first of all congratulations your body wont magically transform in two weeks but youll feel so much better and youll see differences in your skin and overall health before i went vegan i struggled with multiple eating disorders i still struggle but the vegan lifestyle lets you eat in abundance which your body wants because the food you eat is your energy stay carbed up of course but also drink plenty of water at first i started to replace animal products with vegan products such as almond milk go veggie cheese earth balance vegan butter bagels daiya cream cheese boca burgers boca chicken patties gardien orange chickn oatmeal with maple syrup  peanut butter and vegan cereals humans are addicted to dairy and cheese so replacing them with a vegan option helps curve the cravings although all the food i mentioned is vegan junk food i just wanted to let you know that there is literally a vegan option for anything and that youre not missing out xo good luck,NOT,NOT
if you read the study they misrepresented the information,NOT,NOT

ik this is a vegan topic based video but you have to think of overpopulation and how to control it so instead of abused mass produced farm raised animals people who choose to eat meat could hunt for what they and their families consume its way better than all the wasteful ways of the meat production and its low in cruelly because the animals would develop in nature this would be hunting for survival purposes not trophy hunting,NOT,NOT

as far as frappuccinos go i mean theyre not healthy but if you want one every once in a while there are vegan options the actual base of all fraps is dairy free whether youre getting a coffee base or cream base or you can swap out the regular base for soy milk if you want you just have to focus on the flavour portion and skip anything with dairy example nothing chocolate and no caramal drizzle and obviously no whipped cream if you get the light version of any frap it automatically contains dairy so frappuccinos you can still get coffee mocha oprah chai espresso green tea strawberries and crme,NOT,NOT

i personally think that a good portion of the actual wage gap comes from men being more aggressive when it comes to requesting raises and are willing to over compensate when wanting the raise my wife for one was fine with just being a crew member i encouraged her to work harder and show her employers that she is worth more than what they are paying her within  months she was offered shift lead and i continued to boost her confidence and pushed her to stay on top of things giving her advice on how to prove herself she pushed and worked harder she out shined most of her co workers with in a year she was made management i helped her develop the tools needed to excel and succeed in the job she liked i encourage her and stand behind her whenever she feels that she isnt doing good enough and help her reach the stars because she means so much to me and i can see that her success makes her happy she never would have accomplished so much with out a mans outlook to guide her not saying she would have eventually gotten the position on her own but she would have taken much much longer the way she was handling it she is strong without me but she is even stronger with me we are partners and she outshines me now and i am so proud of her,NOT,NOT
i feel like an important choice this video skirts around is the choice to be a mother we as a country dont have laws protecting maternity rights also clarification i am not a feminist i find the idea degrading and counterintuitive i am however a deontologist who values all people,NOT,NOT
imagine if this were a man talking even though the points would be exactly the same the opposing side would totally smite down the ideas the videos make fighting identity politics at their own game nice,NOT,NOT
you can do it trish ,NOT,NOT
so basically the summary of this video is that wage gap exists because women work fewer hours with less paid time periods because they have children and because they tend to gravitate toward jobs with lower pay in other words men dont earn more because they are men but because they work more,NOT,NOT
prageru is smart they find the facts double and triple check them then they get someone who you wouldnt expect to present the information they dont get a white male talk about racism they get a black female whos seen the facts and believes them they get a female to talk about sexism it makes it harder to argue against them because people cant attack the speaker for being sexist racist or privileged it avoids ad hominem arguments being used against them and makes the facts look more credible,NOT,NOT
part of being an educational venue is presenting the facts and allowing the audience to draw the most reasonable conclusion prager university sets a mandate on what youre allowed to think right at the title,NOT,NOT

can someone please correct me if im wrong so there is no such thing as a wage gap however there is an income gap and this is based on choice people make with women birthing babies and all mostly staying home or only working part time hence earning an income equal to c for ever male dollar and there is no job that a women actually gets paid less then a man for the same work just looking for some clarification is all,NOT,NOT
ive been watching you since  months ago and i had no idea you had such a cute ginger cat  noice in other news trisha is grabbing at straws for attention as a grown ass woman when will she stop,NOT,NOT

if your going to be a raw vegan ya go ahead small in all the calories you can but if your eating bowls of rice all day its not going to help you loose weight fruits and veggies are low in calories and you can eat as much as you want of them until you get full but anything else you should have in moderation i would try some vegan places out so it spieces things up and you can get some ideas of what you can make for yourself,NOT,NOT
i think this is kind of a borderline episode moment for trisha i just really wish it didnt have to be published for the world to see ,NOT,NOT
seems that one study which was omitted is should be obvious that one which cites the fact that the greatest single explanation for the gap is the fact that women give birth to children and are more involved in raising them if fact when this factor is factored out the wage gap favors women it is much easier for women to exit and reenter the labor force than men women have a much greater number of occupations which are easier for them to exit and reenter than men women simply have many more employment options generally than men the wage gap is mostly a function of the fact that most men are employed continuously whereas that is less likely for most women,NOT,NOT
same thing happened when that guy beat the crap out of a girl in the mma so bad that he cracked her skull and gave her a concussion if youre gonna be unfair and use your natural born male testosterone to your advantage like this against women then it would be fair to make leagues for just them theyre ruining it for the women league now,ABU,ABU

nowadays people use the word troll very loosely not a lot of people know what it means anymore so it was very nice for trisha to remind us,NOT,NOT
having a bad experience being a woman does not mean ur transgender dude being a woman is tuff we get a lot of shit we have to deal w so much that men dont have to so i get wanting to escape being a woman but i think this stems from a place of self hatred and self esteem issues rather than being transgender i think youd feel so sad and lost if you transitioned my  cents xoxo,NOT,NOT
shut up please,NOT,NOT
or watch the video where freelee challenges shane she talks about vegan places near shanes house and i guess escuse me if im wrong you live near by ,NOT,NOT

trisha is clearly just a super lost person shes grabbing onto anything and everything to feel acceptance shes the definition of hotmess whos way too involved in internet fame its all she has and this is just sad its also super wrong though you cant just jump on something thats so serious as another thing to get you validation when so many are going through a real struggle that people need to support,NOT,NOT
if i was running a business and could get away with paying women less why couldnt i just pay everyone lower more profit for me right,NOT,NOT

this is why i love her yeah she has had her bitchy moments but she is here to help people go vegan and the only prof you need is the smile on her face throughout the whole video,NOT,NOT
please dont strictly follow freelees diet watch vegan gains video he just uploaded about you going vegan and check out what he has to say oh and btw thumbs up for trying a vegan diet,NOT,NOT
make sure to get some actually satiating foods like pasta and beans so youre not only eating fruit also you can add tvp to things for more protein also make smoothies with lots of greens,NOT,NOT
for protein nuts and beans or good good snacks that are vegan are regular lays chip fruits and vegetables granola barsand smoothies,NOT,NOT
if you want to put a quick stop to the gender earnings gap you ought to immediately and completely free up the markets and allow capitalism to thrive if a business pays people any less than they deserve that person leaves their job whenever possible to get better benefits somewhere else you pay a person too much your competitors can run more efficiently than you then and top your profits you might worry that structural sexism would throw a wrench in this system not to worry market forces are very robust against bigotry because again the company that pays its employees based exactly on how hard they work will outcompete and outemploy startups from locally to internationally the worst thing you can possibly do to exacerbate an earnings gap is to give subsidies to certain corporations and make unions and employment restrictions if a ceo entrepreneur worker or business as a whole earns money from subsidies welfare or union dues all of which are illegal to not contribute to these funds are socializedforcefully taken from citizens they have no reason to pay their employees fairly or price products fairly they dont need to work hard at all to earn this perverted capital yet it seems so many who decry this gap are more interested in collectivist egalitarian ownership of wages rather than allowing people basic property rights and the ability to get employed where they want to youll compromise against actual solutions towards the gap every single time which demonstrates you really dont care about this issue at all,NOT,NOT
going plant based is great but it also doesnt mean healthy eating boxed or frozen vegan foods is still unhealthy make sure youre eating as many raw fruits and vegetables as possible and also go carb i highly recommend high carb low fat veganism,NOT,NOT
your into was so cute and funny omg ilysm,NOT,NOT
i might be crazy but anyone else understand trish here and doesnt think she is trolling everything she said can be proved she has always been attached to gay guys she always had lgbtq friends she does either dress up like a drag queen or just roll out of bed i think she just shouldnt label what she is and just go for what she likes,NOT,NOT
women arent much of a hard workers  they like money but hard work isnt much of a thrill for them,NOT,NOT
the title says there is no gender wage gap then it goes on to explain there is indeed a wage gap smh,NOT,NOT

this made my day,NOT,NOT
thats so fucked up where are womens rights now,NOT,NOT
i am so proud of you for saying what is on your mind even when you dont have to,NOT,NOT
blaire can i havs some advice im currently identifying with genderfluid due to me feeling okay mostly with being a girl but honestly for some reason my name which is very girly bugs me i love cute skirts and dresses and femininity but i hate my birthname i feel weird about having a chest and i really wouldnt mind being a dude part of me wishes i could be im a cosplayer and it makes me so happy to cosplay in general l but one cosplay that was a boy my age boosted my confidence more than you could ever understand getting the your so handsome comments always makes me feel better than pretty ive gotton increaseing more uncomfortable with being called daughter or neice over the years am i just genderfluid or am i trans i feel like i dont want fo be trans and i feel like that may be contributing to the confusion i wanna be called and socially be a boy or just not a girl but i dont wanna be trans idk im confused,NOT,NOT
im so proud of you trisha,NOT,NOT
as long as you make me a sandwich,NOT,NOT
seems like a defeatist mindset then theres all of those magical variables no one can define in the end the gap still exists either way which defeats the supposed premise of the video this one seems odd,NOT,NOT
its not because youre lazy jays just have different priorities in life theyre taking time off of work to raise kids and do special things with them when men tend to stay and work to make money thats not sexist thats just a fact,NOT,NOT
i can agree that flexible hours would help however who stays home with the kids is a decision couples make maybe women need to insist on working as many hours in their jobs as their husbands additionally you broke this down into  simple categories  which didnt even go into trade jobs or labor jobs rather than specific jobs an example oncologists and neurosurgeons or any surgeon is going to make more money by far than a general physician some one with a social science degree who goes into business is going to earn less money than a person with a degree in economics or straight up business this is because more people go into the field of social science than business hours worked is another factor the more hours you work  even on a salary job the more likely  all other things being equal that you will either get a raise or a promotion it also seems that men are more likely to ask for a raise than women or take the risk of leaving one job for another there are a lot of things which play into the earnings gap and it is an earnings gap not a wage gap same job worked same hours same number of years yields a far smaller or even nearly zero difference in pay it is imo disingenuous to call this a  wage gap,NOT,NOT
this is so good im lost for words,NOT,NOT
is been proven time and time again that men have a physical advantage over women nothing sexist about it that is just plain facts of science and nature i dont care that they have gone through hormone therapy they even said in the video that everybodys body responds differently if there was no advantage what is it just a coincidence that they always finish one and two  i think not these parents say that all they care about is their childs wellbeing very hard to believe they are promoting distructive behavior and mental illness ,ABU,NOT
 of the people who disliked are angry feministsthe other  are idiotssad but true,NOT,NOT
she was only vegan for like  days she ate chicken and waffles on her snapchat,NOT,NOT
one of the moms they naturally have testosterone in thier bodies female ovaries produces high amounts of estrogen and small amounts of testosterone learn your facts kids,NOT,NOT
my first halloween in la was in weho i saw the most incredibly gorgeous men like absolutely beautiful i thought i was in heaven it took me a while to realize what was going on there was gay people in my small town but i wasnt really around the community growing up so when i found the community i fell in love high school musical looking muscular emotional in touch men it was confusing as fuck to me that they were with other men i was confused about myself i was so tall and had a large build and felt masculine sometimes especially next to some of these extremely feminine gay men i thought i was a lesbian for the longest time i thought feeling masculine equates to me liking woman i was attracted to woman but i was not a lesbian i fell for my gay male best friends it was hard not to they understood me i thought maybe i was male inside sometimes but chose to present female years later ive dated mostly men ive had sexual relations with both but none of thatin the end really has anything to do with feeling masculine im biologically female who has some masculine emotions traits and physical attributes at times i am female and so is trisha,NOT,NOT
it doesnt matter if its  cent or  cent its still not fair to women i have female friends in the work place that get paid less than men its hapoeninb in my school it doesnt matter if its one cent it still can make a big difference,NOT,NOT
bravo what a wonderful production this gave me with hope that we are bounding closer and closer to a time when most people will see compassionate eating as the way to go,NOT,NOT

honestly if this isnt a troll then her ramblings sound like someone having an identity crisis someone that doesnt fit in anywhere and everyone is kind of against her no one really accepts her anywhere by her own fault of her trolling and being an idiot so shes trying to find something to explain her confusion with who she is and where she fits in the world again by the  chance shes not trolling,ABU,NOT
yayyyy trisha i used to be against vegans and hated that they used you in videos to make you go vegan but  weeks ago i watched knives over forks and i went vegan just like that its the best thing ive ever done and ive lost kg in  weeks and i literally eat so much and whenever i want go trish xx,NOT,NOT

men were earning k while women were earning  percent less  k vox you are just making the whole misrepresentation worse  is  lower than  im sure  sounds much more convenient for you to make a point and surprise people but this is something that is taught in primary school  is  lower than   is  higher than  please dont try to educate people if you cant or dont want to get even this right,NOT,NOT
i have five points about the wage gap  if it were really true why woulnt companies just hire all women instead of men and make an additional  in profits for their share holders i am sure no one would complain if a company hired all women in fact it would be celebrated as a trail blazer  do we think that every plumber the vast majority of them are men by the way in new york gets paid the exact same amount for unclogging a toilet if not there is a wage gap  why is it not your responsibility to know what you are worth and negotiate what you think is fair if you get what you think you are worth there is no wage gap if you dont know or underestimate your worth it is your problem the last time i checked indentured labor is against the law so if you are not paid what you are worth it is your responsibility to find another job that pays you a fair wage  some people both men and women will accept less than the market wage in order to compensate for their lack of experience or education it is an opportunity for them to join the workforce and prove their worth this is essential for competition keeping wages in check and giving people a chance to enter their profession of choice  what are we doing about the wage gap between blacks  whites asians  nonasians vegetarians  nonvegetarians muslims  christians or any other classification of people we can think of,NOT,NOT
women making that kind of money is disgusting thats way too much for them to be earning,ABU,ABU

this is a complex issue yes gender discrimination happens and yes women are probably paid less than a man because of their sex however there are many things that contribute to the  for a  a man makes some of it is measurable such as education but some of it you cant measure the best way is to take a company with roughly the same experience same college education and than performance indicators to indicate if their is a true gender income inequality right wing will tell you it doesnt exist left will tell you it does but how many will admit its somewhere in the middle its probably not nearly as bad as the left portrays but it does exist probably in the tiniest amount,NOT,NOT

they are not girls you can identify as a baby or a cow or a baby cow but it would not make you one hormone therapy does not make you a girl it does not override the fact you had four times the testosterone developing your muscles and bones since birth not to mention they went through most of puberty as boys this is permanent they are winning not because they are talented but because they are boys racing in a girls race some the comments here are alarming haley  how is it cheating how are you that ignorant what are they teaching kids in school today are they afraid to tell them the truth so they lie and tell them hormone therapy takes away the advantage seriously so we are raising a society of imbeciles for the sake of not offending trans people wtf,ABU,ABU
if the wage gap existed where men make say  an hour and women make  an hour then why not only hire women why pay men the extra  when you can save that by paying only women,NOT,NOT
ppl who say women get paid less because they have kids yes because its their choice to have kids and get pregnant by themselves,NOT,NOT

i miss the gender pay gap because now women get paid more than a man for less overall work,NOT,NOT
if there is one woman in america working a legal job getting paid less than a male coworker with exactly the same hours education contract time in the job etc then she can sue the pants off her employer as well as publicly humiliate them on social media doesnt really sound like a patriarchal conspiracy,NOT,NOT

transitioning to avoid brushing your hair holy shit,NOT,NOT
u just want male privilege you literally just described yourself as gender fluid,NOT,NOT
i want you to be aware that some people start off pretty rocky when they first go vegan from either not being sure what to eat and how much or from your body cleansing its self once you start a healthy diet your body wants to release all the junk toxic food you have been eating before and thats why people feel tired sick gain weight etc and it gets mistaken that veganism is doing that to your body but really its the food you ate before releasing just stick with and youll feel amazing and get great results this is what happened to me in the beginning but i kept going and adjusting to what worked for me and im soooo glad i did because it was one of the best decisions of my life almost every problem i struggled with mentally and physically wishing all my luck towards you trisha,NOT,NOT
honestly what bothers me is treating the men as the bad guy in this statistic i mean the use the fact a lot of women want to have kids as the big reason for the gap or the fact many women would just stay home with the kids however there is sth that doesnt get adressed mainly  well if a woman stays home who do you think needs to earn more to support that yeah a man i swear it like this statistic tries to frame men as these greedy bastards cheating women out of their money but if the woman stays home with kids that leaves the man responsible to earn money for that woman with kids so this horrible image of a man cheating woman out of her money is in fact earning money for the family why is this never brought up,NOT,NOT
im so sick of yall hating on other people for eating meat people are raised eating meat so yall need to chill the fuck out because i am done and if we dont want to be vegan we dont have to and these hate comment on trisha is a fucking dick ass move and i fucking hate all of yall being assholes because of the way she is so the next time yall hate on others because they are not vegan think about before you became vegan because i know that every fucking single one of you are meat before and dont act like yall having now all im going to say is fucking stop assholes,NOT,ABU

i own a business and have men and women working for me women have beautiful work ethic much better work ethic than men but when it comes to physical tasks in our place i find men usually can work harder for longer periods of time but not always true but i believe thats why men are paid more though theres a higher demand for male employees i have better success in my business hiring males over female but we do a lot of physical labor i hire women for jobs in my business that i need people to be more trustworthy and meticulous however,NOT,NOT

hey i totally get this im sorry ppl dont understand,NOT,NOT
this video is ridiculous the problem is that women are paid less for doing the same job so when a field employs more women the average income in that field decreases because women are paid less than men the reverse is also true men get paid more for the same job so a fields annual income will average out higher because they hire mostly men,NOT,NOT

if u subscribe to prager u your an insecure ignorant sheep think for yourself,NOT,NOT
i need to ask a question i have compared my pay to women at the same job and it is the same pay so where is the gap i have looked at men in higher payed jobs and noticed they usually involve risk taking of some form so the gap must probably then exist in these levels of employment my question now is if you see fit to charge a man more for insurance because of risky behavior why dont you see it fit to pay men for these traits,NOT,NOT

the gender wage gap is described as the relationship between men and womens pay it is said that women are getting paid roughly  cents to the dollar that every man makes the wage gap is calculated by taking the average amount full time men and women make and dividing them by each other to get the difference in regards to womens soccer from the article pay disparity in us soccer there seems to be a pretty large pay difference between the players however there is also a benefit difference for instance women get a salary and possible bonuses along with health benefits and maternity leave whereas men do not reap these benefits but i would assume the article did not include mens salary they make more if they play often i chose to watch the video there is no gender wage gap and i do agree with some of the points that she brings up for instance she spoke about choices that men versus women might make that add to the variables of the pay they earn womens often choose jobs that are not considered to be the most high payingpersonally i do agree with some aspects that she brings in the video i chose to go to school to become an elementary school teacher i could have chosen a route with a much higher pay but i enjoy working with children and love the classroom environment being a school teacher i would be able to have summers and holidays off i believe it would be a profession where i could also raise a family without having to pay thousands of dollars for childcare,NOT,NOT

talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice its my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legallybinding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality given the fact that lawmakers ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation,NOT,NOT

hi freelee ive been thinking on going vegan for such a long time now id say probably  months but ive never gotten around to this because my parents dont support this opinion and all they cook is animal based products im  so obviously i cant move out lol i was wondering if you had any tips for going vegan even when everyone around you eats meat i naturally have never been obsessed over meat tbh like i never found the tastiness about it so that is not really what my problem is my problem is that my parents will not buy the large amounts of fruit that i need for the raw till  diet that i really want to get to is there a better way to still be a high carb vegan without doing the raw till  diet thank you for influencing me and making me realize that animal based products are disgusting ,NOT,NOT

unpopular opinion ive been vegan for a measly  years my problem with the community is the campaign that veganism is cheap demand and supply has risen yet the cost goes up with it im sorry to say but i dont believe the whole population is going to go vegan as long as a big mac is about a dollar while an apple is lb can we start urging the vegan companies we support to start becoming more financially accessible,NOT,NOT

i agree with everything you said except for when you said that if you think someone isnt lgbtq you just shouldnt call them by their preferred pronouns and name or believe them when they say they like someone ive thought that people have faked it before and i was wrong so i always just try to be respectful if they arent hurting anyone i dont care who you like or what your pronouns are ive some out to people i thought were friends and they said i was faking and im not and people have said that im faking having anxiety for attention when i actually go to therapy and have real problems also the part when you said that celebrities just come out to get more famous one person i can think of that didnt do that is brendon urie from panic at the disco he came out as pan he donates to lgbtq charities and he had the highest hopes foundation he also sings girlsgirlsboys at all the shows not everyone just wants to come out to be interesting some people just want their fans to understand them more and feel not as alone sorry for my rant thanks for coming to my ted talk,NOT,NOT

theres quite a bit to unpack here sure companies can hire only women and make their discrimination more blatantly obvious but i think taping a please sue me sign on their door wouldve been cheaper  maybe the wage gap is lower fair doesnt mean it doesnt exist  even with the same education credentials men still get paid more than women for the same job even aauw one of the sources she uses in the video said so also the point about men and womens common major choices is irrelavent because as confirmed yourself in the beginning of the video the issue is getting paid less for the same job  her final point men are more likely to work more hours doesnt debunk women getting paid less for the same work for the same hours now does it thanks for pretending youre going to address the issue for what it is and then dancing around it,NOT,NOT
trans girl i have no advantage basic biology im going to destroy this mans whole career,NOT,ABU
but its obviously not as explicit as one singular employer having one man and woman whom he pays an unequal amount its not that clear cut and youd be naive and frankly ignorant to believe so its a systemic issue we devalue womens jobs and have created an atmosphere where women are discourage from taking careers in fields such stem or medicine typically the higher paying jobs alternatively the explanation for the gap in positions would be that women simply arent smart enough to earn the top positions,NOT,NOT
i cant believe its being debated i understand that some trans women have less testosterone a similar amount to a biological woman but they still got a bigger bone structure and longer limbs giving them countless advantages in sport if i was president or what not that would be enough for me to put my foot down instantly,ABU,NOT

bbbbbbut there are   even five genders triggerednoreason,NOT,NOT
feminists so often portray the wage gap as being about discrimination in the business sector probably because the gap is highest there the problem i have is how they insist on applying this to all men and all women those guys collecting garbage probably dont have it better than women working part time in a law firm but we kind of pretend they do everything has to be because of the patriarchy after all its all men oppressing all women rather than just people who have more opportunities being more likely to get high paying jobs,NOT,NOT
womens wages also pan out equal to mens getting smaller later in life due to an increase in  divorce,NOT,NOT

i agree with the state rules of those  states it makes the most sense however i dont think trans people should be completely prevented from competing with the gender they are transitioning to its a slippery slip but it just reminds me of the argument of it being unfair that blacks are competing with other races because they naturally are faster so its unfair,NOT,ABU
how do you know a person is a vegan do worry they will tell you  eye roll,NOT,NOT
totally missing the point here there is  a gender pay gap though smaller than  difference between men and women even with factors such as education level age race and job title in every country around the world i think the reason for this is more biological than social such as men naturally having more risktaking tendencies such as asking for promotions and women naturally having more caregiving tendencies such as devoting more of their time to household duties,NOT,NOT
i understand ,NOT,NOT
i dont like labels titles the video i am transgender,NOT,NOT
vage gap doesnt exist work hours  proffesions job type promotions and overtime are not accounted for it has been illegal  businesses to pay women less since the s if companies were able to get away whit it they would only hire woman real wage gap is between  or  depending on the field the reason  this is pregnancy and childcare wich makes women take less hours andor overtime there still is one but  an understandable reason,NOT,NOT
insert wage gap button here the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not account for different job position hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,NOT,NOT

i have known about the wage gap for a long time but did not realize how significant it was in class we found out that some of the highest paying jobs such as petroleum engineering are primarily help by men and jobs like education positions are held by woman and they make significant less than males i think women are expected to be in these positions because of our motherly instinct what was not surprising was in some positions like serves in restaurants and retail the gap was smaller to me this job works in favor of women because they are more likely to be friendly and can get tipped on how attractive they are which is actually sexist in regards to the us men and womens soccer team wage gap the women in recent years have been more successful and have more winnings than the men but are still earning less while the gap for the top players on each team are not significantly large the further down the list the larger the gap gets between men and women pay disparity in us soccer its complicated states that women require more health insurance and there a pay cuts if they become pregnant andrew das  this is a parallel to what we read in the textbook businesses cut a year of wages for woman because they are likely to take a year off to take care of family members and maternity leave adams et al  the video there is no gender wage gap however argues there is no gender wage gap because the studies are based off of different careersschooling men in women have but how can they explain the gap between men and women that hold the same job and equal amount of education,NOT,NOT

it just depends on how you define wage gap if you define it as women earn less than men then there is a wage gap if you define it as women earn less than men on the same career path then theres still one its just much smaller if you include the discrimination of females from choosing certain career paths then theres still a large gap anyway so there is a wage gap the debate is how big it is,NOT,NOT
she disproved the wage gap in the first  of the video,NOT,NOT
so in a nutshell its not sexism,NOT,NOT

coming from a libtard here as i know republicans call us good video wage gap is almost  a myth i would have liked to see an example of a specific job that a man and a woman share and their wages to solidify the argument but ill just assume that thats where the  comes from i do have an issue with the tone of the video though i get that pragerus audience is more republican and conservative but the aggressive tone and use of wordsphrases like myth and sexists dont have their math right are just unnecessary rude and alienate half of your potential audience the people who you might want to convince that they dont have their facts exactly right the numbers dont lie in this case economics is clearly more complicated than businesses pay them less because theyre women but an aggressive tone does more harm than good,NOT,NOT

lmao i was waiting to see what blaire thought of this nonsense,ABU,NOT
wow they actually halfway explained the facts instead of just blaming it on sexism they did leave out that during this time one of the major reasons that the responsibilities with children were so unequally distributed was because this was a time when about half of marriages ended in divorce and fathers rights were being trampled on by the courts and fathers were expected to pay child support and alimony out the ass while having little to no interaction with their kids so of course if your husband is giving you a check your not going to work as much as the man that has to pay that check things have gotten better with fathers rights now due to men who fought for them with angry feminists battling them the entire way but hey this is a big improvement over five years ago when this video wouldve been the wage gap exists because im a victim and im a woman so if you try to prove me wrong with facts youre sexist,NOT,NOT
why are all of you so angry at feminists who protest like for one century or even less whereas men were generally dominating for the rest of human history there are exaggerations but some feminists might overreact to be heard by those sceptics and not because they want to exterminate men antifeminists are as well overhappy to see this video as possible evidence that feminists are wrong,NOT,ABU

another thing that you notice about feminists is that they often have this toxicity and hostility in debates as soon as you disagree with something they say and counter it with facts youre just an offended and insecure and most importantly mansplaining broflake or something like that basically all the time when a dude disagrees with something a feminist says he is instantly met with ad hominem attacks or other forms of highly arrogant and almost narcissistic answers i cant recall a feminist that actually started to engage in a discussion in which heshe actually replied to my comments it basically always follows this scheme  initial comment based on perceived truths  countering that statement with actual facts  ad hominem attacks and bringing up more unproven claims while ignoring the facts from the first answer  countering the new claims with facts as well  fleeing into conspiracy like excuses example well the patriarchy raises us like that when you showcase how the pay gap is a result from individual choices and further ignoring the stated facts or simply claiming they are wrong without providing facts and evidence to support the claim that the aforementioned facts are really wrong,NOT,NOT
men need more calories on average so they need more money for food a basic need this is justified because the work they do requires more calories on average so there should be a certain wage gap between men and women but there isnt one,NOT,NOT

great presentation and makes sense the only problem i have is with the title it is incredibly misleading the reality is there is a significant gender wage gap however you look at this women work less hours do less dangerous work and essentially whine more in new york city young professional women make more money doing the same job as their male counterparts in addition lesbians and black women make more money than their white counterparts doing the same work why because they tend to put in longer hours but regardless there is a gender wage gap lol ,NOT,NOT

also people obsessed with the wage gap i want to make this as clear as possible going around and blaming some secret sexist cabal of men and taking it out on your coworkers and claiming that theyre womenhaters or we is stupid men and women in theory strive equally to get paid and earn raises however a store that employs  people may have only  people actually in control of the salary those two to three people may or may not be as sexist as you think they are but taking it out on your coworker who is more interested in getting home to snuggle up to his so and spending time with the family and is doing his best to keep himself awake and in a positive mood while pouring over boring as hell spreadsheets or putting up with some idiot customer who firmly believes that  off applies to every item in the store instead of a specific product is only going to earn you animosity he probably doesnt set the wages he may even be mad as hell that hes putting in overtime and working extra hard but got passed over so the ceo could give himself a nice bonus he may even have a wifesisterdaughter who isnt getting paid what she should be and the entire family is suffering for it or hes doing his absolute best in his dwindling spare time to fix that accusing him of sexism is about as useful as getting mad at a chicken and accusing it of causing obesity,NOT,NOT

as a man the woman who was hired for my job before me made  more with less education and experience than me she literally made more than me for the exact same accounting job i dont think this wage gap is true youre stats are out of context of their papers thats awful science its not even science at that point nowhere do your stats talk about women choosing responsibilities or their perceived quality of life this is click bait id say stahp but it makes you waaayyy too much money and youre a woman making more than many men just by making videos based on stats i dont have to cite as you dont either,NOT,NOT

wow im actually shocked vox a liberalbiased news source actually puts out real facts instead of the sjwagenda this is a step in the right direction the wage gap is not because of discrimination or women purposefully being paid less by male employers this was made illegal with the equal pay act of  it exists because on average women choose lowerpaying jobs are generally obviously there are exceptions less assertive when it comes to payraises and work less hours due to things such as maternity leave raising a family etc,NOT,NOT

if two people have the same demand from other workplaces same experience same education same grades same connections and in every single way are identical to the workplace then they should get the same salary per hour thats simple the wage gap in many cases if not most comes because women value family time and social time higher than men do they also on average have more sick days than men do then you have the whole baby making period in the  year period for women if a man and a woman started out fresh out of university at the same job and same salary the statistics tell us that a man will sacrifice family time and social life to work more all these extra hours give more experience more connections and youll be more in demand by workplaces because of that in return that gives you a higher salary likewise a career woman that did all the same sacrifices that the man did will be similarly payed for their experience however another difference in men and women also determines their salaries and thats how much they demand a man will typically not be afraid of conflicts or stress in salary negotiations where as a woman will typically fold earlier and get a lower salary why because men are psychologically plugged or trainedinfluenced while growing up that men dont quit and women you have to sit pretty is it right or wrong neither each and everyone has their life to control if you want a career and rise to the top you have to sacrifice something if you want a family and time for kids and a lot of friends then you have to sacrifice something else biologically and psychologically were predisposed to certain things as a man i would love to be a stay at home dad and take care of the kids house and things like that however i work in education which also satisfy my desire to be around kids and teach with that comes many different advantages and disadvantages just like other types of work or lifestyles do point is that everyone needs to stop looking to blame others for their own shortcomings or sacrifices money isnt the only thing wealth can be measured in some  year old man or woman that sacrificed family and friends in order to build their career might have money but they dont have the same social life or family bonds again you pick what you want dont blame anyone else for that,ABU,NOT

i totally agree with you on the trisha topic but i guess its okay for sam smith to come out as nonbinary i believe in nonbinary being a thing i dont believe in genderfluid astrogender or anything crazy like that but when a person is trans and cant identify with being either male or female i believe its okay for them if it fits them to call themselves okay english is not my foreign language is themselves with v correct nonbinary if thats what makes you feel euphoric and eases your dysphoria hell yes go for it and with sam smith i just hope we have a positive example of a nonbinary person i just hope for some other representations than those crazy astrogender transtrender,NOT,NOT

so nice to see such a positive response video freelee shows what a beautiful person you are ,NOT,NOT
you cant just eat fruits and veggies to be vegan you will have lots of health problems you need to eat grains and proteins and things that will fill your stomach longer than  minutes you should read up on veganism more and watch some meal prep kalel is a really good example she has amazing vegan meals and shes a devoted vegan ,NOT,NOT

there is still a gender wage gap the video is very good the conclusion misses something however the bestpaying specialties often require flexible hours in business for instance a high paying career is one that requires you to have a lot of meetings outside of your  routine given that women tend have more commitments at home than men they are not as free to shape their lives around their work like men so are there less women in highpaying jobs because they consciously dislike highpaying jobs and prefer lowerpaying jobs no because we expect women to take care of the kids to make dinner to wash the clothes to take care of the house as a result men are more flexible than women as a result you wouldnt hire someone who cant be as commited and if you are expected to not be as commited you wont even consider these jobs this explains why in science and research careers for instance which dont require as much commitment outside of  hours women do just as well as men is it fair its a different debate in my opinion yes it is see ya,NOT,NOT

im all for eating more plants but i dont think we should force people to stop eating meat if we are worried about methane check out taronis technologies they have the solutions to all of the climate arguments and they are talking to the governments around the world including our own we dont need extreme ideas just need to use our brains and create technology we need more co to make plants grow faster and bigger with our population increasing i dont think reducing the co is the answer but i would agree that we need to find cleaner ways to use the fuels we have taronis technology even adds oxygen to the atmosphere and im not sure that electric cars are going to make our world cleaner when the majority of our electricity comes from coal gas and petroleum we need clean technologies i do think that educating people on plant based diets is a good thing most will see the benefits if they are willing to try it,NOT,NOT

okay so you normalize for job title and years of experience but thats the problem men are much more likely to have roles in management and high paying job titles than women women are burdened with having to take care of children and work a fulltime job at the same time while the majority of men can just focus solely on their career and be home just in time for dinner to be ready while not contributing much else to the household and i could bet you that my male coworker who has worked there less than i have gets paid more just because he has a masters degree next to his name and because hes a male even though i have much more work experience in total than he does because our indian boss comes from a culture where there is a huge bias of gender and education title,NOT,NOT
just because trisha has a massive following doesnt make anything she says about herself  is invalid or done as some form of stunt for clout if she had only  followers she would be treated like any other transgender because theres alot that goes into an identity and just because one person has a completely different trans experience than you doesnt make your transness invalid a community is open to all not for those who fit within this specific frame or category of what they think transgenders should be if she identifies as a male then she identifies as male you can say your opinions to her but to now call her out of her name even after she told you her truth is so messed up and ignorant,NOT,NOT

freelee can eat a ton of calories because she excersizes like crazy and shes superrrr fit the key to the raw till  diet that she promotes is eating a ton of carbs in the form of fruit veg rice and potatoes and excersizing hardcore for an hour a day and being active if you want to loose weight on a vegan diet and not excursive that much you need to lower your caloric intake because your body wont be burning all of those calories off theres no doubt about it though that whole foods especially when theyre in their raw form are the best for your body and you will be the healthiest off nutritionally if youre just eating vegan not specifically raw till  or excersizing frequently i would suggest to eating so that the bulk of your diet comes from fruit and veggies cooked or uncooked with some brown rice  potatoes accompanying it and once in a while adding in some beans and rarely some nutsseeds you dont have to worry about protein deficiency because it literally doesnt exist since everything you eat has protein in it dont cook with any oil and try not to add salt to any food youre eating thats to loose weight if youre going to fall off the wagon and are thinking about stopping being vegan its good to educate yourself more on the ethical reasons why a vegan diet is so good watching forks over knives gary yourofksys speech on youtube called the best speech you will ever hear earthlings and other things will help also as well if youre feeling like youre going to fall off the wagon because you really want to eat your favourite   try looking for a vegan version of that in the grocery store lots of times the vegan version of things are really tasty and helps the transition or have some pasta or bread nonwhole foods carb options these things are not recommended for loosing weight though thats more for the rare treat or once youve reached your goal weight to loose weight cut out the alcohol up your water intake to about l a day a big l or l water bottle really helps with this and drink l of that water with lemon each morning before you eat breakfast maybe drink it while you go for a walk first thing after you wake up and then come back to eat and make sure youre getting adequate sleep and try to avoid stress hope this helps ,NOT,NOT

nonono you cannot eat as much as you want when you have the mindset of wanting to lose weight calories in vs calories out you need to be in a calorie deficit in order to lose weight eating food will not make you lose weight no matter what any miracle website out there tells you find out what your maintenance calories are the calories required to stay at your current weight and then eat under that there are  calories in one pound so as long as your total caloric deficit per week is around there you will drop a pound per week which is healthy also do not let these hclf people tell you avoid fat no fat you need fats in order to absorb certain vitamins and it aids in protein synthesis which helps build tissue  produce cells make sure youre doing this in a healthy manner do more research and find out what it is that you need to do i weight lift on a higher carb vegan diet  of my calories comes from carbs and it works for me so i can tell you that doing the lifestyle right will produce great results that you can stick to but if you do this completely blind youre gonna end up hitting a wall because someone turned you onto a vegan fad diet understand what macro and micronutrients are what they do to your body and how they work in sync with others make sure youre getting what your body needs depriving yourself will put your body at great risk understand calories in vs out etc etc just be smart about this and it will work trish good luck ,NOT,NOT

has vox considered that perhaps women would prefer working longer hours at home and men would prefer working longer hours at work everyone makes tradeoffs and those tradeoffs often result in different wages there is nothing wrong with this and its a mistake to assume any difference between aggregate male wages and aggregate female wages is an injustice that must be remedied,NOT,NOT

there are many wayst o solve this wage gap problem i personally dont see it as a problem so long as earnings per hour is the same these mannerisms are all purely social and it boils down to undemonizing men and fathers as incompitent holliwood loves to show the mother as the does everything and the men as unparenting and if they are a good parent they are a divorced b mother died or c learning the mother is always more compitent in shows and movies in parenting this provides a social stigma that if there is a child in the family the man isnt the main influence its the woman this makes bosses in the business district highly uneasy with giving women promotions to jobs that require heavier hours or more rigorous work when they are pregnant as they will also have the burden of their children now another example is that in a core family ideal it is the man who does the work and the woman who stays home now when this ideal shifts its interesting to see how people react if both parents are working theyre both valued and putting money on the table if the father is working and the mother is not its considered a normal basic family if the mother is working and the father is taking care of the house he is often considered a leech and a deadbeat thus the men in order to avoid social hatred from peers and so on always gets a job or at least most men will try to get a job a woman on the other hand doesnt always need a job to be considered acceptable or normal a very huge example of this is in the military there is a large amount of males in there in a stable secure and well paying job while a large amount of women associated with the army happen to just be house wives without much of a job stastically this forces the wage gap to be in mens favor since they are socially required to be employeed or theyre considered practically on the same boat as criminals and meth heads finally this wage gap will probably never be fixed because of that earlier detail i mentioned the military is a dangerous job as well as lots of other jobs its clear that men favor or do not mind dangerous jobs that could result in injury or death while women on the other hand do not favor those jobs dangerous jobs pay more,NOT,NOT

okay but like i do not agree with trisha i dont think she is trans but when you brought sam smith and the person from queer eye into it saying they wanted to come out for clout i do not agree with that yes they might not talk about it maybe because they dont just want the attention if they just did it for clout dont you think they will make it a bigger thing than it already is yes the person from queer eye might have not came out in  but thats because not a lot of people were okay with lgbt and gender identity and things like that back then its  it is the best time to be coming out because you do have so many people supporting it and a lot more acceptance and a lot more rights not saying there arent people out there who hate but im just saying its more accepted now then it was a few years ago but with the whole trisha being trans thing yes she is obviously doing it for the clout and views no arguments on that one,NOT,NOT
this is awesome i remember trish saying in one of shanes videos that she didnt like animals and didnt care what happened to them so her  ethical reason was very surprising to me i really hope that she can make it work but at least now shes beginning to see the truth and the benifits,NOT,NOT
very good arguments but when i first heard this myth i did my own research and found that there is a different sized wage gap for every single job out there and that something like  of those is where women are the bigger earners so i think my arguments deviate somewhat from sommerss arguments but they still argue against the same lie,NOT,NOT
i love that you bought chik fil a especially because theyre run by people who support conversation therapy i will admit their chicken is good but not good enough for me to sleep at night after giving them my money,NOT,NOT

the fact that the parents or the  transgender girls dont see as this to be unfair is the real problem but we all know that if they were actually on the mens team we probably wouldnt even know who they are they wouldnt be dominating the boys track team its really disrespectful to continue to be on the team knowing that you have an advantage,NOT,NOT

one of the variables for the  cents left is maternal verse paternal leave in australia employers are at least legally binned to offer  weeks paternal leave verse something like  weeks i think im not  sure for maternal leave so even if both people take their maximum allotted leave and come back with their spouse taking care of the child the man will still work more hours the pay given is still equal but less than they would earn than when theyre working therefore there is at least part of that  cents probably a large part due to it being not even mentioned in this video,NOT,NOT
thats not right boys are stronger faster,ABU,NOT

the comment section is horrendous people forgetting that these are still young children and they are excelling in healthy activity probably maintaining good to excellent grades and using their personal time wisely to perfect their craft and do what they love enjoying their youth and doing what makes them happy not being disrespectful at all but yet its a religious sexist racist vile and an astonishing amount of people spreading their hate in the comments its actually very sad change starts within yourself i hope that when you face a challenge or are challenged in some type of way where you are the minority you remember the hateful things that you typed here ,NOT,NOT
didnt expect this from vox,NOT,NOT
i think youtube is up to something i searched up gender pay gap myth and the top results were liberal videos with just over mil views when normally this video should come up because it had more views i liked this video but when i came back it said that i hadnt liked it google and youtube tries to censor out the right and promote their own left ideologies typical,NOT,NOT

its sounds like you are nonbinary not transgender,NOT,NOT
probably the definitive book on this is warren farrells why men earn more written some four years before this study it identifies  areas where men on average make different decisions than women on average that is all the points made in this video and more the central insight is that the road to higher pay is a toll road higher pay generally means sacrificing something lowerpaid people do not why this is so important is that realising the actual reasons for the earnings gap empowers women  and men for that matter  to make choices to boost their earning potential if thats what they want to do any given person has of course the right to decide that they dont want to miss their kids soccer game move to the other side of the country or work in a highly stressful and competitive environment areas of their life other than their paycheck will doubtless benefit its just a bit silly for anyone  regardless of gender  to make these choices then turn around and compare their paycheck with another person who decided the money was important enough to them for them to make these and other sacrifices,NOT,NOT
yawnthis video could be so much shorter if she just got to the pointgood luck though and be careful because you can still gain weight,NOT,NOT
this is good journalism other vox reporters take note back up your claims with real facts and research and you will be better received,NOT,NOT

you dont understand  that shrinking gap is feminist activist achievement  not the female get more productive in the workplace,NOT,NOT
warning this channel spreads climate skeptism and denial this is no university channel but a fraud the founder of this channel dennis prager is a religious fundamentalist and a republican politician in us clearly this man wants to spread the hatred of other religions misinformation against gender equality and basic climate science i have no doubt that this channel is funded by big corporations to spread lies and misinformation in people and thus make them weaker against their interests please do not share or spread the videos posted by this channel,NOT,NOT
sorry but kim kardashian can never call herself a vegannot with all the products she uses that gets tested on animals as well as the implants im aware she hasnt called herself a vegan as yet,NOT,NOT

dont calorie restrict or else youll feel horrible dont binge either make sure you eat each meal until you feel satisfied and saying that you cant eat just a banana or just an apple for a meal,NOT,NOT
i appreciate this study however most of the points it makes for reasons women do not work late is children the conservative side argues that women in general do not work longer hours before i accept this video at face value i would like to see the same study for women without children and see if the wage gap still exists there if it does your video might need some rethinking if it does not your video is legit and make sure the ages of the childless women are about the same as the ages of the women with children or the conservative side will argue that women tend to work harder at an earlier age and that the earlier aged men slack off more than their older counterparts have to have all bases covered,NOT,NOT
a drag queen has nothing to do with transgender sure some drag queens later transitioned ex gia gunn however their are drag queens who are gay bi pansexual even rarely straight its  people also drag shows are used as entertainment its a job thats why they dont go full glam everyday but they dress like gay men because they are gay men who are working drag queens smh trisha theres my two cents peace ,NOT,NOT
they forgot about taking into account different job positions as well as the fact that its illegal to pay a woman less,NOT,NOT
wages and earnings are not the same thing men and women have the same wages there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap because men do make more money only because they choose to do more difficult jobs and do more overtime and work more hours and take less breaksdays off and ask for raises more often women dont make as much money because they are not hard workers it has nothing to do with muh patriarchy,NOT,NOT
 years later and we are still talking about this,NOT,NOT
