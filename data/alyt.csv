freelees you can eat as much as u want isnt  accuratemaybe it is if you run a k everyday amd do alot of excersise but the foods u can really eat as much as u want of are like carrot sticks minus hummus or like apples or oranges or grapes because those will fill u up fast bc they have a lot of water so u wont really have to eat that much to be full like the whole eating a ton of rice or a whole box of pasta or  pounds of potatos or  mangos is not really healthy unless off course u do a ton of high intensity excersise,1,NOT
regarding your weight you may notice some fluctuations in your weight because your metabolism will be changing  weeks is a relatively short amount of time so i would encourage you to keep being vegan even after your music video to see how it affects your body also regarding food eat as many fruits and veggies as you want and if you are feeling hungry make sure to eat more potatoes and beans nuts are also a very good source of protein if youre worried about being protein deficient the worst thing you can do on a vegan lifestyle is starve yourself so just make sure that you are always full from healthy food good luck,1,NOT
awesome quinoa is good for you and has protein add chia seeds to everything they fill you up have protein fiber omega s anitoxidants i add them to oatmeal for breakfast add fruit and cinnamon chia seeds are hydroponic so if you were to add them to a smoothie drink or nut milk  they expand so they fill you up i am excited for you great job,1,NOT

ive been vegan for about two years and i can tell you from experience that you will lose weight if u eat lots of carbs  like  cals a day and exercise at a moderate intensity for about an hour a day  days a week your metabolism will slowly speed up and heal so to speak from the damage youve done to it by under eating and binging then u will experience weight loss and youll start to fell so much better in your own body,1,NOT

its actually really common for people to gain weight when they first go veganvegetarian because their body is used to being deprived of nutrients from calorie deficiency dieting starving yourself and is still storing everything as a fat reserve your body will adjust within a month or so of normal eating sufficient calories carbs and nutrients and plateau at a certain weight then youll start losing it best way to combat the initial weight gain is to drink a lot of water and exercise daily  min of cardio is a good starting goal just mentally prepare that youll gain a bit of weight before youll begin losing it because of your dieting habits  good luck oh and also root chips  leaf cuisine spreads  bomb its healthy probiotic chips and dip and it can be used instead of creamcheese  its vegan and dairy free if you want to substitute soda try kombucha as well ,1,NOT

finally somewhere i can be of help beans are a very good source of protein on a vegan diet as a milk substitute you can have rice almond coconut cash you and soymilk i believe there are few more milk substitutes but those are the only ones i can remember as of the moment if you were looking for an amazing meat substitute i highly recommend a brand beyond meat they are the best meat substitute i have come across i recommend their beast burgers there also so soy free which is something you need to keep in mind soy in large amounts can be harmful to the female body hopefully i was helpful,1,NOT
eat good carbs that are filling like rice pasta with veggies potatoes bananas etc this will fill you up so your full and satisfied ,1,NOT

yesss im so happy for u trish be sure to have lots of grains also dont be discouraged in the beginning if you gain little bit of weight because your body is getting used to the metabolism from the vegan diet but eventually youll start dropping the pounds a lot when i went vegan i am lost  pounds within the first two weeks so but i was vegetarian first so it was a little healthier than a carniat so just be aware that you might gain a little bit at first but then youll start shedding off the weight nonstop good luck,1,NOT

i dont think youll see the results you want from going vegan in just  weeks ive been on the diet for about  months and ive lost  pounds my skin looks clearer no more zits i feel a lot healthier in general it took a long time though to get into a good rhythm with food i did so much research and watched so many food diaries on youtube i think its a good step but youre not going to reap the benefits you want off of this diet in just  weeks you might not even lose weight freelee looks great but she also exercises a lot shes very active i do think as a vegan you need to find a balance your body needs fats and oils which freelee is against i use coconut oil to cook with and extra virgin olive oil i also eat avocados and almonds to get my fats in i still eat between  calories a day to  depending on my daily activity and because im dieting a little i dont think everyone can just eat as many calories as they like from fruit and veggies and lose weight doing it everyones lifestyle is different get your veggies in for sure my food diary usually consists of eating almonds with all natural organic peanut butter ill have a smoothie with  bananas frozen berries hemp protein almond milk sometimes a date or  then other days ill switch my bananas for an avocado with spinach and berries and coconut water for lunch and dinner i usually eat similar things it could be a veggie burger pasta with veggies quinoa or brown rice with veggies i like spicy foods so if youre like me youll enjoy this snack i buy peppers and red pepper hummus and just dip peppers into that and omg its so good if im craving chocolate i usually buy some organic dark chocolate put it in the freezer and snap off a piece now and then always make sure you read the back of the label with everything you buy theres lots of information out there immerse yourself in research and youll do great also if youre craving meat id buy meat from morning star or gardien for cheese always go with chao cheese its the only cheese brand so far thats impressed me dont expect the fake meats and cheese to be identical to the real stuff its different just still tasty in its individual way,1,NOT

hi to zach efron when did this happen,1,NOT
gardein products are great especially as you transition and might struggle to come up with meal ideas you can not eat as many calories as you want ive found that to be very misleading in this community use an online calorie calculator to get a general idea of what you should be eating or better yet get your rmr tested and know for sure how many calories your body burns at rest still pay attention to your macros at each meal nothing crazy just try to include a healthy protein at each meal this is what has worked for me youll get  different answers but youll have to tweak it to find what works best for you ,1,NOT
trish but what about the chicken quesadillas,1,NOT
if you need ideas on recipes i recommend watching raw alignment she is very inspiring and supportive,1,NOT
yay congratulations trisha the next  weeks even if it is just that will save the lives of many animals  losing weight as a vegan in my experience the freeleeworshippers will differ is mostly veggies and fruits a smoothie for breakfast a brown rice wrap with tomato lettuce avocado spinach arugula a smear of hummus or vegan cream cheese kite hill only good brand for lunch and a small pasta kite hill even has ricotta cheese ravioli if you get a cheesy craving for dinner we have as much junk food and fattening food as any other diet if you eat just oreos and vegan ice cream potato chips nudge most bbq salt and vinegar and original flavored are vegan you wont lose weight dieting as a vegan is still dieting you just get to feel more full because vegan foods tend to be less calorie dense and more filling you should expect to feel weird kind of sick then kind of good digestive changes will make you feel weird its natural good luck girl,1,NOT

being vegan is actually quite easy and you can still eat amazing foods  lots of pastas and rice and potatoes french fries you can still eat out and eat lots of great food for protein beans and quinoa and seeds etc its actually much easier and you can eat much more than you think and a vegan diet definitely wont make you loose weight unless you diet believe me ill eat black bean burgers with asparagus and garlic mushroom pasta with vegan pesto potatoes fries rice and beans etc if you want to lose weight diet if you want to be healthy gp vegan,1,NOT
going vegan buys a new leather handbag lmao girl please,2,NOT
i love you now trisha and im following u now cause of ur decision of going vegan its my going to be easy in the beginning but its going to be worth it ,1,NOT
your only regret will be not doing this sooner so excited for you its really wonderful in so many ways,1,NOT
if you have a veggie grill in la go there everyday lol its basically a burger joint but everything is vegan and it will give you ideas for meals you can cook at home ,1,NOT
starches are your best friend girl  potatoes rice etc also fruits and green veggies  theres tonnes of great instagram accounts for food inspo,1,NOT
you go girl checkout vegan food channels like hot for food or edgyveg they have step by step vegan recipes and they all taste amazing those are the channels that made me realize going vegan is beyond just fruit and veg  unless you are trying raw vegan diet  then its completely different story ,1,NOT
you need to try gardien meats they have so many products that immitate chicken fingers and beef and its all so yummy i know that they are luxry vegan products and u dont rlly need them but it has rlly helped me transition into this lifestyle,1,NOT
oh god that banana girl is gonna be all crazy when she sees this,1,NOT
read for all the answers you need and to add eat whatever and how much you want is sort of a lie to me try to keep your calories still around the recommended  area and eat foods that are easy to digest for you drink lots of water no soda or anything like that keep the sodium low that will help prevent bloating the most and try to keep around below  mg a day  mg at most is best because our bodies arent used to digesting sodium so it clings onto water cells which makes you appear bigger because then that water cant exit your system due to the bloating you can also eat starches like rice potatoes not french fries baked potatoes or even sweet potatoes are the bomb and also oatmeal pasta whole grain but no bread bread has a lot of sodium and it is so hard to digest pasta has nearly no sodium and oatmeal has barely  per serving i would also suggest to have melons and fruit as a lunch like a fruit salad and banana smoothie for lunch after a oatmeal breakfast make it with water though and  calorie sweeteners arent as bad as people think as long as its saccharin and not aspartame with lots of fruit on top  i love pineapple strawberry and blueberry and last but not least you do need to do the tiniest bit of exercise maybe walking around town or around a mall for about an hour a day will help loads okay im done ranting xd remember low fat  less than  g a day is when i feel best high carb  around  is what i usually get in a day and around  calories which is what i et around and low sodium i usually have around  mg a day and about an hour of walking and youll do great i really hope youve read this and if you have please give me feedback by replying if this has helped remember i went from  pounds to my lowest of  so i know what im saying ,1,NOT
but on your snapchat you just posted you eating sour cream and onion chips which contains milk so i dont know when you are actually doing this but just an fyi sour cream and onion chips contain milk,2,NOT
trish this is so great i myself come from a very eatingdisordered past for years i alternated between extreme starvation and hardcore binge eating which eventually just turned to binge eating all the time food became the central part of my life my entire life was planned around food and once i would binge it would be like oh well i guess that was the whole point of today anything else i do today is pointless may as well just go to bed this all changed when i went vegan here are my tips  eat as many whole foods as you can if a fruit smoothie isnt satisfying enough for you in the morning add lots of hemp seeds and almondcashew butter and chia seeds those will give you healthy fats and fiber increase your calorie intake and just make you feel fuller and give you a better start to your day another important ingredient for smoothies for increased energy and nutrition maca powder it makes your smoothie taste like fucking malt balls mmmm  stock up on emergency foods that are high in calories and easy to make or dont require any preparation at all like frozen burgers burritos pizzas but also just nuts and seeds these will be your best friend when you dont have time and you need to eat something its good to snack on nuts or dried fruit throughout the day to keep yourself from getting hungry later in the day and then bingeing on something terrible  try to throw as many greens into your food as possible you will eventually grow to crave them and this is coming from someone who was obsessed with bacon and cheese and was disgusted with vegetables lol i now crave spinach arugula and kale we humans are creatures of habit you can literally train yourself to crave healthy foods even if you cant stop eating the bad ones lol its best to sneak greens into a fruit smoothie especially one with really sweet fruits like mango or pineapple because then you cant even taste them  just google things like easy vegan recipes or vegan comfort food and bookmark a bunch of them for future reference get earth balance vegan mac  cheese but when you prepare it with a plant milk of your choice  earth balance vegan butter  although its fine without the butter honestly add like  tablespoons of nutritional yeast you can get it at whole foods for an extra cheesy flavor also look up recipes for tempeh bacon  you can make bacon mac  cheese with that shit soooo good there are so many great products out there obviously the best healthiest way to eat vegan especially for weight loss is to stick to eating as many whole foods as you can make everything from scratch etc for instance if you have a good blender you can make your own mac  cheese from soaked raw unsalted cashews and sweet potatoes and nutritional yeast and lots of spices or alfredo from soaked cashews and cauliflower and nutritional yeast but there are so many great products to buy and keep in your freezer its good to have them on hand for when you have no time and youre craving something savory and meaty if you dont have those products as a backup you might end up bingeing on something nonvegan and then feeling shitty about yourself although with all the vegan options at taco bell chipotle various pizza places wendys etc you can still get tasty vegan fast food try beyond meat and field roast meat alternatives theyre so fucking good there are amazing nuggets at whole foods in the frozen food section i think theyre by that whole foods brand  or whatever its called take it from me a person who used to binge like crazy and was only happy when i could eat tons of bacon and cheese and pasta with cream sauce and burgers and steaks i couldnt imagine going vegan until i watched a few documentaries and freelees videos too and decided to just fucking go for it it saved my life and now i dont even eat that healthy all the time i like meat alternatives i like frying stuff in oil etc but im still thin and looking good and i dont exercise even when i smoke pot and binge which happens often lol my weight stays the same because its all plant foods rich in fiber good luck you can do it ,1,NOT
check out hotforfood great vegan channel,1,NOT

im glad to see this but at the same time youre not going vegan youre going plant based going vegan implies that seeing and knowing what goes on in factory farms and fur farms has effected your morals entirely and that you have decided to stop supporting the evil veganism is not a diet its a change of perspective  its not supporting animal torture for the sake of taste and luxury i hope your plant based diet does make you go vegan though we need more people with a conscience ,1,NOT

its all about baby steps and im so proud of you for doing something to better yourself and you have to take small steps to stay vegan and not get off track but yes you definitely need more foods more greens more beans and grains etc another thing you should push your viewers to watch those slaughterhouse videos because it does really show you exactly what happens and makes everyone who sees them understand how horrible the reality of the situation is and it could make everyone change their views just like it did for you again i am so proud of you trish for doing this,1,NOT
i stopped eating pigs after i read charlottes web and then i got a pet lamb and stopped eating sheep and so on and so forth if you cant do vegan trish start with vegitarian and try vegan again in a couple years as long as youve improved to be more ethical youre doing a great thing,1,NOT

trisha you can still overeat on a high carb diet dont forget that watch what  days of eating all the fruit i wanted did to me and some other videos on that topic i wouldnt want you to eat too much calories end up not loosing weight or even gaining it and then end up blaming it on veganism and saying veganism didnt work out for you freelee that vegan couple and most high carbers work out they have very active lifestyles so they can afford to eat that many calories truth is that you can and probably will lose weight coming from a standard american diet to veganism but unlimited calories is an unrealistic expectation dont take this the wrong way this is just a friendly advice coming from a fellow vegan good luck on your vegan journey,1,NOT

hey trish im also a new vegan but i have some experience as ive been a vegan for a few months now i eat a starch based vegan diet rather than what freelee eats raw till  basically she eats an all fruit diet until  pm an then she cooks a vegan meal for dinner and shes made countless videos on what she eats in a day definitely go check them out personally however what i find to be more sustainable is a starch based diet that a lot of vegans thrive on heres an example of what i eat in a day breakfast mango smoothie i eat a smoothie for breakfast nearly every single day i freeze bananas and mangos and put them in it for a cool and creamy texture similar to icecream lunch three small brown potatoes with and asparagus broccoli and cauliflower medley i typically put a tomatoey sauce on top or sometimes barbecue sauce if im looking for some nice tang dinner basmati rice and black beans with an avocado sprinkled with granulated garlic i usually combine the mixture w tomatoes red onions and lime in addition i have a bit of salsa on the side snacks i only eat fruit for snacks remember to carb the fuck up if i were you i would stock up on rice legumesbeans fruit and vegetables whole grain breads and pasta and vegetable stock also try lots of lentils and stuff like quinoa the recipes are endless also cauliflower is amazing and is good for a lot of vegan dishes i find the most of mine on pinterest its amazing remember that you must eat in abundance on this diet and stray away from replacement items like daya cheese however if you crave those items spend the money on a vegan pizza every once in a while you will make mistakes but just remember to forgive yourself this is no temporary fix however if you want to see true long term results you must continue on a beautiful diverse whole plant based diet since my vegan transition i have lost the excess off of my stomach and see it being a lot flatter in addition my skin isnt perfect bc i do suffer from acne but it has become much more manageable and has cleared up tremendously throughout this journey you will see body results but it also teaches you how to love your body and also a lot about compassion i encourage to keep researching the vegan lifestyle and motivate yourself to continue love you trish good luck on your vegan journey,1,NOT

just letting you know the grapes are full of sugar  baby carrots are normal carrots shaped to look like baby carrots i dont advise you to go on freelees diet i put on weight with her diet i advise you to always have breakfast maybe start juicing for lunch  protein with  veg for dinner and try not to eat after pm if you get hungry after dinner try eating a couple of dates or date rolls with skim milk for desert or a treat freelees eat large amounts doesnt work,1,NOT
educate yourself eat enough calories and stock up on staples like rice potatoes beans oats etc and if you accidentally eat something not vegan its no big deal you already did it just stop if you figured out its not vegan and continue on with life just continue to vegan veganism may seem hard at first but after youve done it for a while it becomes more than a diet and just a way of life good luck on your vegan journey,1,NOT

yay trisha finally i recommend vega protein powder  use almond milk i also love this app called yummly you can look up vegan recipes i like morning star or gardein for like little snacks through out the day or for dinner i also recommend yoplait yogurts because they do offer you calcium and protein or you can eat mixed nuts or dried fruit because those will also offer you protein garbanzo beans quinoa and couscous are awesome sides to have for any meal because they are super high in protein and for me i eat tofu quite often bc its tasteless so you can use any sauce on it and itll only taste like the sauce but the texture is like scrambled eggs its super easy once you get the taste of all the awesome vegan foods you wont want to go back to eating meet ,1,NOT

im vegan and ive got a couple of things to say about this nothing negative i promise first off i think what you said about if freelee would be nice in her youtube videos if she would people wouldnt watch when she does shocking things people do watch there are sooooo many vegan youtubers out there that are nice but none of them are as popular as freelee second what you do need to realise is that having a vegan diet wont magically make you lose weight the only thing is that vegan things are generally less dense in calories although they do fill you up thats why when people go vegan they will lose some weight in the first few weeks but then when your body starts craving those calories you will stop losing weight unless you obviously go high carb low fat like freelee because thats just a really good way to lose weight slowly and healthily and third i would recommend eating lots of fruit and not too much other food for now for these two weeks to lose weight quickly for the video but if you want to stick with it you should definitely eat more rice potatoes beans legumes bread and meat replacers since they are the things that will fill you up most and they will have enough calories to keep you going if you eat too little calories you will feel horrible and blame veganism although really youre just not eating enough and then last my favorite thing about veganism and i think yours too is you get to eat so much more even with processed food vegan things tend to have less calories so you get to eat more without having more calories i hope youll make the right choice after these two weeks the right choice for your own health for the animals and for the planet if you want to educate yourself further i would recommend watching cowspiracy and earthlings although earthlings only shows animal abuse as where cowspiracy shows more environmental issues,1,NOT
eat lots of greens it will help with the digestion and where you can get your protein,1,NOT
nuts are a good protein,1,NOT
make sure you include a starch in every meal ie potatoes rice bread etccheck out the vegan corner on youtube for yummy recipes,1,NOT
heyyyy im vegetarian but a lot of indian foods are vegan easily made vegan its pretty easy to make and theres a lot of leg room for error while cooking so give it a shot ,1,NOT
you cant just say something doesnt count while youre on the diet because u will start saying that to urself and basically put urself in denial,2,NOT
now i love you even more yaaas mama save the animals,1,NOT
some of the comments are harsh this is a big step for trish let her take her time give her encouragement dont discourage her dont hate her for eating pizza comment a good dupe tofutti pizza is ,1,NOT
good lord please dont premote freelee worst person ever,5,ABU
thats so great one day at a time girl  if you like how it feels and you know you want to eventually be a vegan for life know that it can happen and that if you go back and eat some animal product once twice a few times you dont have to throw in the towel some people go vegan overnight and stick to it but many many people dont like me if you really feel how it feels in your heart as well as physically and mentally you can get there never ever thought id go vegan either in the past,1,NOT
skipp the added salt u will loose alot of waterweight and drink all the water,1,NOT
first of all  you did not loose your sd card thats a bold face lie i watch freely and her card became corrupt and they tried to save the footage and no video stores could salvage it so she said to be fair you cant upload yours you ate vegan dog nuts and she showed you slaughter videos she even has footage of you trying the doughnuts on her video she tells your entire conversation about why your not gonna post yours you get caught everytime you lie second everything you bought is fruits  straight sugar  you willllll gain a ton of weight you have to eat a balanced diet or you will get very sick you have to have nuts veggies rice beans avacados proteins healthy fats fiber carbs you name it each of those things plays a part in bone density blood pressure kidney  liver function major organ function you can die from not having a proper diet thirdfreely works out and rides a bike for  miles daily they literally spend hrs a day on fitness so she will burn off the  bananas a day she promotes go watch all the other videos of girls who got deathly ill on her diet who gained lbs her man durian uses steroids to build muscle who knows what she does she ate like  mangos on one sitting it was like  callories no one can eat that and be so tiny ask any dr i am all for you being vegan but listen to a real dietician be smart about it,2,NOT
im personally not vegan im a vegetarian but i do watch a lot of vegan and raw vegan youtubers brianna jackfruitson nickacado avacado kalel simply quinoa supreme banana just to name a few for foods id recommend brianna the most she has so many raw vegan meals that can easily be cooked she was fully raw for the longest time and started getting into cooked foods again theres nothing wrong with being raw but there is definitely more variety as a vegan than a raw vegan youre the best trish  i hope you stick to the diet for a while and i know you can do it,1,NOT
thats awesome you go girl its super easy but rather than doing it temporary why not do it for life you should include beans and rice brown rice and any kind of beans,1,NOT
hey trish i eat a lot of rice with beans for protein and pasta i also like to make wraps or burritos french fries or onion rings fried in vegetable oil not too healthy but good lol you should also try any kind of veggie burger they can be hit or miss but most of the ones ive tried have been so good just make sure you get it with no mayo or cheese and the bun is multigrainwhole wheat bc those are usually vegan as well good luck ,1,NOT
small steps there are so many amazing vegan options pinterest has a bunch,1,NOT
what to eat while on your diet spagatie or vegetable dumpling or grilled vegetables and veggie burgers and chips and dips and my favor is sweet pato fries there sooooo good ,1,NOT
the documentaries are all one sided viewpoints as a part of the ag industry the processing plants strive for the most humane treatment of the animals dont believe everything you see in the mainstream media i am all of r doing what makes you feel god and healthy but please dont become one of those who tries to push a vegan agenda down everyones throat because of the one documentary you watched,2,NOT
bahahah hmmmm ok,2,NOT
so proud of you trisha major character development also almond milk and coconut milk is super yummy and very good for you you can put that in your coffee and i recommend veggie grill the restaurant amazing food,1,NOT
for protein i make quinoa and brown rice on a weekly basis gardein has really yummy fake chicken not super healthy but a nice treat if you have a craving the beauty of a vegan diet to me is that i eat until im satisfied but dont experience the pain and exhaustion of overeating food my body struggles to digest dairy is a hard one to give up especially cheese to me the cheese replacements are a bit pungent i personally like sauted mushrooms as an alternative the most important thing is to remember that we are all doing the best we can and wherever this journey leads you we have to have respect for one anothers choices,1,NOT
i love how shane and her made fun of vegan foods awhile ago and now shes going vegan,2,NOT

your so awsome for this video even if its only for  weeks i am very proud of you and honestly you dont only have to eat fruit you can eat sooooo many other things just a tip and dont worry about calories if you are going to be eating healthy foods,1,NOT
ill tell you what i learned from being vegan for  years im eating meat now because my b was heading towards the danger zone dont let that deter you though i just sucked at being vegan lol as much as i took pride in making the food i was still a pretty lazy chef and was very uncreative when it came to eating out but these were the good bits   the best time to eat melon is either at the start of your day or when you havent eaten in a fair while as melons have a pretty high water content and will run into anything ingested before it  when i was trying i beat a lot of unhealthy food cravings by studying the contents of each thing identifying what part of the food it was that i was craving and then substituting the unhealthy thing for a healthy option chocolate craving was magnesium fast food craving was usually fat and would be replaced with an avocado nuts or whatever  i couldnt afford vegan cheese so veg pizza with whatev i could find to add flavour was a staple,1,NOT
also almond milk is soo good when you go to starbucks replace milk with soy or coconut,1,NOT
your body has to get you to it and you might bloat at first but it will pass effortlessly dont give up veganism is actually super easy and way less expensive than meat diets you got this,1,NOT
ive been vegan for almost  years now and i will never go back i recommend to buy almond milk oatmeal and rice those are my favorite,1,NOT
yay awesomeyes vlog the weeks it is such a great choice to go vegan,1,NOT
if you can afford it hire a vegan chef for at least the next  weeks good luck,1,NOT

yesss trishhh hummus and celery is a really good snack and great for protein,1,NOT
my number one tip is to stay educated watch forks over knives earthlings cowspiracy best speech you will ever hear by gary yourofsky secondly carb up potatoes rice pasta beans legumes fruits thirdly find alternatives that you like there are so many brands that make vegan meat i recommend gardein also there is a vegan alternative for absolutely everything just find what you like and what works for you it may be tricky in the beginning but it is honestly sooo easy ,1,NOT
i went vegan for about a month and a half but it had a complete opposite affect on me i started breaking out like crazy and i never had energy i made sure that i was having enough calories and nutrients but for some reason my body was completely rejecting it has this happened to anyone else if so has anyone found out why,1,NOT
trisha was eating meat on her snapchat story not even  hours ago,2,NOT
lets play a game called shes not going to last,2,NOT
and remember fruits and veggies have like no calories so if your meal is jus fruits like you showed you have to eat a lot of them because if you are full you are less likely to reach for something unhealthy and you need more calories to because your body will be burning a lot,1,NOT

welcome to the vegan life here are some things that helped me when i transitioned from vegetarian to full vegan  water water water water your body is about to go on a journey so be nice to yourself and keep it clean  fruit for breakfast its the easiest meal plan ever you can have as much as youd like and the fruit you consume in the morning pushes out what you ate the day before  be kind to yourself this is a new lifestyle and you will make mistakes thats ok just make a mental note about what you ate dont buy it again and move on  if weight loss is your main inspiration for going vegan check out the skinny bitch books they have a sharp tone but are also funny and informative  when you cant take it any more and are seriously craving junk food remember oreos are accidentally vegan ,1,NOT

beans have a lot of protein and other nutrients eat a lot of greens for vitamins along with your fruits also nuts can be a good source of calories freelee is an extreme case she has a fast metabolism most likely but more importantly shes very active so she has to eat a lot of carbs for normal people who drive around the city all day you cant just eat a bunch of carbs and think youll get thin a lot of people becoming vegan eat too many carbs because they use starch as a replacement for meat starchy foods have a lot of calories and they turn into fat if you dont use the energy immediately you should check out the unnatural vegans channel here on youtube she has good advice and supports everything she says with evidence which a lot of other vegan youtubers dont or they think anecdotal evidence is sufficient when its not i think being vegetarian is enough for me but i end up eating vegan pretty often im mostly concerned about the environment though i also dont eat meat because i cant support killing animals for food in good conscience so it always brightens my day up a bit when someone wants to be vegetarian or vegan  good luck trish hope this finds you ,1,NOT

good luck doll cant wait to see how this turns out for you cutting back a lot on alcohol or completely eliminating it from your diet would help immensely as well just a suggestion if you still needwant to drink do you but even if u only had one day a week that you allowed yourself to drink you would lose a good amount of wieght also eat more throughout the day as that speeds up your metabolism whereas if u starve yourself or only eat once or twice a day your body stores fat cuz it doesnt know when u will feed it again good luck to you doll xo,1,NOT
freelee where you at,2,NOT
hottest fat girl ever,3,NOT

it is not really true you cant just eat as much as you want on a vegan diet it is just that if you are on a raw vegan diet or raw till four trying to eat those  kcal on raw fruit and vegetables might be a little difficult because of the amount of food you gotta eat to eat enough d so that is why they say eat as much as you want but in fact you can be vegan and overeat if you eat only vegan breads grains potatoes oils too much nuts etc i think if i am wrong can anybody explain it better d ,1,NOT

im so happy for you sorry but vegans dont use real leather so all your purses will have to be thrown out if you continue to become vegan,3,NOT
this video was filmed around june  is she joking by proclaiming veganism or even vegetarianism yes but i think its based on ignorance a lot of people who become vegetarian or stick with the vegan lifestyle are cutting out meat or animal byproducts because of vicious deaths of living animals cutting out meat andor animal byproducts can also be very good for the human body if youre maintaining a healthy and balanced meal with other nutrients but by becoming veganvegetarian it really begins with educating yourself on how to do so,2,NOT
this is an old video and surely a trolling one too,3,NOT
its helpful to count calories in the beginning to make sure you are eating enough the biggest mistake people make is simply not eating enough,1,NOT

thumbnail looks like sucking dick nice,5,ABU
trish youre awesome d,1,NOT

im so proud,1,NOT
someone told me that soy can make youre hormones go crazy does anyone know if thats true,1,NOT
my husband recently went vegan about a month ago i went more vegetarian my first shopping trip i couldnt help but laugh at myself because of how much fake meat i bought i definitely am not used to cutting out meat yet but i havent had any real meet in a few weeks i take pictures of all the products i buy and put it on my instagram so i can track what things i actually like when i go shopping again gardein and daiya are two of my favorite brands so far,1,NOT
check out a youtube channel called the vegan corner makes all kinds of vegan friendly dishes like lasagna brownies curry tortillas cinnabons etcyou are definitely going to want to make at least one meal instead of eating just strictly fruits and vegetables all day thats usually what i do i snack all day on fruits and veggies and make a vegan friendly meal during the part of the day where i have the most time also youre gonna hear a lot about smashing carbs and calories dont do that when youre starting out eat as much as youd like but dont overeat to the point where youre too full that will just make you end up feeling kind of sick i have binging problems i just feel like sometimes i have a void that i need to fill so veganism is great for me because i can literally just eat and eat and not gain any weight from it those baby carrots are great for binging if you ever have an urge same with celery apples anything that requires a good amount of chewing dont be afraid to use some peanutbutter or humus with some of those things too the great thing about being vegan is you can eat two or three times the amount of salad and itll make up one little cheeseburger from mcdonalds speaking of burgers try some veggie burgers trader joes has pretty good ones or you could look up recommendations online even when i was a meat eater i still preferred them over an actual beef burger and dont think that just because youre vegan means you cant eat junk food you can still eat chips oreos fritos nutter butters poptarts etc just google if vegan friendly foods and you should get a huge list also continue researching on veganism in your free time you really do so much good to the world just by doing that one simple thing of choosing something different to eat for your dinner its kind of like recycling you feel like it doesnt do much but when you join a group of people whos goal is the same it has a bigger effect than you think hope veganism goes well for you,1,NOT
i seriously dislike freelee as a vegan i prefer to watch the unnatural vegan instead and other youtubers who use science and evidence to back up reasons for going vegan beyond animal rights and how to make sure you dont have a bad transition track your nutrition and research places to eat to help give yourself a safety guard from accidentally meatanimal products ,1,NOT
pinterest is amazing for recipes  been vegan for years and its the best thing ive ever done bite size vegan is an amazing channel to look at,1,NOT
 being vego will make you gain  i gained over kg when vego then went vegan and lost like kg struggle to keep it on tbh stay away from the dairy its pure fat baby cow growth formula fruit veg carbs like potatoes pasta rice and like maybe a couple of awesome vegan donuts per week or day and you will lose weight your body may need more than  weeks to adjust though so please dont be discouraged if its not immediate  its a lifestyle not a diet  keep that in mind if youre only doing it to look good its called plant based took me a couple month to fully adjust so please be patient and dont expect results a in a couple weeks or b if you are still having chicken eggs or any milk products ooorrr c if youre not in it for the right reasons bc it wont last and therefore it wont work oh also if you eat unripe bananas youll be constipated also the food you showed is like literally one meal more potatoes  good luck trish please listen to the advice and dont expect results if you dont do it right yeah,1,NOT
omg so happy for you trisha  give your body time and itll change for sure  i lost  pounds in a calendar year  i feel great  the first month is the hardest so try to keep motivated by watching videos and educate yourself  whatever you ate as a meat eater just make the vegan alternative  good luck trisha ,1,NOT
theres nothing fair about this bullshit unless you dudes are about to turn down your potential medals  let the real galswomen win,5,ABU
ive been vegan for  years and raw vegan for a month and i love it fruit and vegetables are great and entirely sustainable but youll crash if you dont eat enough of them i eat minimum of  calories worth of them on raw i find that raw vegan is the best way to maintain a slim figure i did gain weight on a regular vegan diet i love raw vegan protein shakes they come in tons of good flavors and are wonderful in smoothies for regular vegan veggie sushi is amazing basically anything thai or indian is super yummy too just make sure that it is vegan youll be surprised how many things are vegan when going out personally i loved chipoltles sofritas congratulations on trying this lifestyle,1,NOT

hey trish some of my fave vegan foods are vegan brownies you can either get the recipe on google or you can buy them in stores sometimes bean curdtofu  try the marinated tofu or you can get awesome chinese meals with bean curd often sweet chillisweet and sour sauce try spicy bean burgers too theyre filling and imo taste better than some fake meat options i also love vegan bacon but ive been veggie for a long time so it might take a while for you to adjust to overall try meals filled with rice cous cous or quinoa they keep you full and incorporate lots of flavours into your diet like soy chilli etc im definitely not an expert but ive been veggie my whole life so hopefully you might find one of these ideas interesting love you mama trish   ps sorry for all the parenthesis in this comment lmao,1,NOT
next week crying on the floor with kfc,2,NOT
riced cauliflower and beans are my go to meal,1,NOT

im really tying to become vegan for health and ethical reasons but i keep slipping up honestly by you doing this its motivating me to keep at it coz of trisha can do this anyone can,1,NOT
give me a brake you will never be a viggan you love meat,3,NOT
well for protein fruits actually contain protein but not as much as you need so i suggest beans beans give one of the best proteins everrrr and im just so glad that at least you learned how abusive humans are towards animals and its just so sad that we kill animals in their own home,1,NOT
i went to a place called the gentle barn in santa clarita i fed horses chickens  hugged cows afterwards we went out to eat and i couldnt bring myself to eat meat that was over a year ago and i have found so many yummy things to eat by doing a lot of research online its helped my waistline and my life in general give it a chance and i wish you lots of luck,1,NOT
this bitch going vegan and has probably about  realleather handbags ,5,ABU
i would reccomend you to not only eat fruits ang veggies eat pasta rice potatos etc too also if you do eat any animal products by accident dont beat yourself up or give up its so important because if you beat yourself up about it you are likely to just give up and also eat when youre hungy your body is telling you that you need food so give your body food i love you so much trisha and i love that you are doing this hope it sticks with you best of luck,1,NOT
im so proud of you trish stick to it,1,NOT
good for you and some tips  you cant eat whatever and not gain weight calories still matter but as long as you just eat until youre satiated rather than overeat you should be fine hotforfood minimalist baker and oh she glows have rly good  some rly simple vegan recipes hot for food has vegan buffalo wings ik,1,NOT

do you wash the grapes though lmao you should if not unless you want to get sick,1,NOT
freelee can eat a ton of calories because she excersizes like crazy and shes superrrr fit the key to the raw till  diet that she promotes is eating a ton of carbs in the form of fruit veg rice and potatoes and excersizing hardcore for an hour a day and being active if you want to loose weight on a vegan diet and not excursive that much you need to lower your caloric intake because your body wont be burning all of those calories off theres no doubt about it though that whole foods especially when theyre in their raw form are the best for your body and you will be the healthiest off nutritionally if youre just eating vegan not specifically raw till  or excersizing frequently i would suggest to eating so that the bulk of your diet comes from fruit and veggies cooked or uncooked with some brown rice  potatoes accompanying it and once in a while adding in some beans and rarely some nutsseeds you dont have to worry about protein deficiency because it literally doesnt exist since everything you eat has protein in it dont cook with any oil and try not to add salt to any food youre eating thats to loose weight if youre going to fall off the wagon and are thinking about stopping being vegan its good to educate yourself more on the ethical reasons why a vegan diet is so good watching forks over knives gary yourofksys speech on youtube called the best speech you will ever hear earthlings and other things will help also as well if youre feeling like youre going to fall off the wagon because you really want to eat your favourite   try looking for a vegan version of that in the grocery store lots of times the vegan version of things are really tasty and helps the transition or have some pasta or bread nonwhole foods carb options these things are not recommended for loosing weight though thats more for the rare treat or once youve reached your goal weight to loose weight cut out the alcohol up your water intake to about l a day a big l or l water bottle really helps with this and drink l of that water with lemon each morning before you eat breakfast maybe drink it while you go for a walk first thing after you wake up and then come back to eat and make sure youre getting adequate sleep and try to avoid stress hope this helps ,1,NOT
awesome trisha well done so glad to see you going down this path after so much back and forth with freelee over the years the best thing i did when i wen vegan was to look up recipes they dont have to be fancy there are so many out there and it will make it waaaaay easier than trying to figure out on your own what the hell to do with all those veggies youre going down an incredible path and when yo find that love and connection with animals and knowing youre doing right by them by going vegan just fills you with so much positivity and passion best thing i have ever ever done,1,NOT

for those who dont know the only reason trish did this video is because freelee the banana girl paid and pleaded with her to do it you can look at trishs snapchat and see she is not eating a vegan diet freelee is having a severe credibility issue at the moment she has stolen content from small youtubers made false copyright claims on channels to silence them and also recently endorsed eating meat despite claiming to be a vegan she was also recently kicked off instagram for bullying other users all this is online and verifiable please dont fall for freelees nonsense i dont blame trish  cash is cash everyone has got to eat,3,NOT

best thing ever get bananas that are very ripe the more brown the sweeter and cut them up and put them in a baggy in the freezer cut up lots then in the morning put frozen bananas and cocoa powder healthy and blend it so its kind of slushy then put it in a bowl then in the same blender mix frozen strawberries and cocoa powder i use what is already left from bananas and mix to the same consistency then add to the bowl of bananas and on top add any fruit you want its legit the best and do filling,1,NOT

she just snap chat chicken lol so yea,3,NOT
i highly suggest going vegan for at least a month because for the first couple weeks your body goes through a detox because its not used to the amount of fiber and if you ever feel like giving in to the standard american diet just remind yourself what made you go vegan i recommend to just keep looking into the horrors of animal agriculture and how it affects not only the animals but our planet because that is such a big issue and if you keep that in mind the benefits or the mind and body just come along with it,2,NOT
i love to skin potatoes and bake them and also rice with tofu and veggies is soo amazing and also lettuce black beans and salsa is frickin bomb glad to see youre vegan i am going vegan because im vegetarian right now i love you trish so much youre awesome and beautiful i hope you stay vegan you are sooo inspiring,1,NOT

first off all when you see people being vegan raw raw to four vegetarian and fruitarian and their not over weight fat chubby or obese of course they will look good because they where original skinny and didnt have to lose so much weight they will look good and will promote that their lives are the best way to live where bigger people if they do theses diets or go on theses lives styles they will end up with excess skin just like every other diet,3,NOT
im so happy for you i am a vegan also and i just wanna give you some tips so you dont make the same mistakes i did i went vegan after watching freelee and at first i lost a ton of weight cause i still ate a normal ratio of macronutrients carbs protein fat and ate a reasonable amount for my body weight once i started taking freelees advise i developed binge eating disorder no of course that is not completly freelees fault but her emphasis on smashing in the carbs led me to trying to eat as much as her then i eventually got used to it i ended up gaining even more than i lost originally my triglycerides in my blood test were too high and i was struggling with digestive issues and energy level issues i am still struggling with binge eating to this day two years later but try as hard as i can to actually eat only when im hungry not out of boredom and stop when i feel good and satisfied rather than overstuffed and feeling like im gonna explode,2,NOT
thats awesome great for you  i guess you could make a mukbang eat veggie grill ,1,NOT
thats amazing trish  freelee does a raw til  diet so she eats tons of raw fruits and veggies for breakfast and lunch and does light exercise and then eats a cooked dinner after  you can eat as many fruits and veggies as you want but beware of vegan junk food try to not eat after  and hydrate some meat and dairy alternatives to eat in moderation that are amazing are chao cheese gardein chicken and almost anything from starbucks without whipped cream java chips and with soy or coconut milk as a substitute i love you trishy and im so psyched youre joining the vegan family keep up your fiber and protein rice and beans for days smash in the fruit girl i hope you love your two week vegan experience and it becomes a longterm thing its not a diet its a lifestyle but it also doesnt have to take over your life ,1,NOT

she says the same thing about eating healthy all the time and it doesnt stick i would have been surprised to see her stick to a vegan diet to say the least,3,NOT
trisha im so proud of you you got this you should check out hot for food on youtube,1,NOT
get gardein mini chicken burgers they taste similar to chicken burgers,1,NOT
im so happy your trying out veganism make sure your eating a lot of whole plant food and carb the fuck up just a warning your face will probably break out a lot the first two weeks because your body is detoxing,1,NOT
i love the person she is becoming i feel like shes growing as an individual on camera anyways i unfortunately have never met her regardless shes got me hooked,1,NOT
try going to vegan restaurants and u can make anything vegan just look for a resipie,1,NOT
this is so great love u trisha xxxx,1,NOT
avoid fatty stuff i put on a lot of weight due to vegan chunk food  yrs vegan now and still figuring out the best ways to do it  no matter what i will never go back love the vegan lifestyle ,1,NOT
is she really tho,2,NOT
you cant eat  calories of plant based foods and expect to lose weight or not gain weight look up people who have gained weight when they switched to a high carb vegan diet also you are not going vegan for  weeks if its for aesthetic reasons the correct term is plant based good luck,2,NOT
make sure youre not just eating fruit and veg in a day you need protein and carbs like pastas and rice wholegrain if you want to be healthier otherwise your body will cling on to the natural sugars in the fruit and you wont loose any weight nuts and lentils are also important also those vegan donuts original chips are good ideas for salt and sugar in limited amounts still need those to be healthy just dont eat too much of them good luck,1,NOT
she eats chicken tenders all the time,3,NOT
my eyes she is to ugly kg make up aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,6,ABU
not hating but she posted sour cream and onion chips on her story and those have milk,2,NOT
ahhh trishy this is so exciting okay my favorite goto is beans  rice beans have a good amount of protein and the rice helps keep you full pasta is also really good and since you apparently like carrots based off this video you could do some thinly sliced carrots in the pasta and it would be so good and if you like avocados they have some protein too they also have some fats that are good for your body and they can be spread on toast and have a relatively similar texture to butter protein shakes are another good option and i frequently have those for breakfast and if any of your bananas get really soft and overripe peel them cut them up and put them in the freezer so you can blend them up to make banana ice cream as a sweet treat good luck with these  weeks and im sure theyll open your eyes to everything you can still eat as a vegan i promise you wont be missing out on anything  its such an awesome lifestyle,1,NOT

finally huntyyyyy okay okay so im gonna start off by saying you probably gained weight on a vegetarian diet because of the dairy which is arguably worse then meat okay so some snacks you could do are potatoes literally potatoes are your best friend my favorite is japanese sweet potatoes because yes another thing is if you want to make something that requires eggs use flax seed eggs as a vegan alternative which you can get a target  as far as milk i prefer sweetened almond milk over soy milk,1,NOT
girl get you some rice quinoa potatoes legumes corn pasta get them carbssssa,1,NOT
as far as frappuccinos go i mean theyre not healthy but if you want one every once in a while there are vegan options the actual base of all fraps is dairy free whether youre getting a coffee base or cream base or you can swap out the regular base for soy milk if you want you just have to focus on the flavour portion and skip anything with dairy example nothing chocolate and no caramal drizzle and obviously no whipped cream if you get the light version of any frap it automatically contains dairy so frappuccinos you can still get coffee mocha oprah chai espresso green tea strawberries and crme,1,NOT

hey trish im so glad to see you are going vegan i originally did it for a few weeks at first and took me about a year to transition ive been vegan for two years and i love it ive lost fifteen pounds and still have my curves my advice to you would be stick to whole foods follow mr and mrs vegans wslf guide maybe even reach out to them for a potential collab check them out on instagram youtube and tumblr good luck on your vegan challenge,1,NOT

trish you should watch unnatural vegans videos here on youtube shes got lots of stuff about proper vegan nutrition so you dont quit after a week eat lots of legumes leafy greens nuts seeds fruits and veggies and youll be fine after sometime you wll need to star using suplements like vitamin b but youve got time time to learn more about it again go to unnatural vegans channel,1,NOT
finally this day has come trisha you are my inspiration in life and i am so happy that you are trying the vegan lifestyle you are going to love it your body is so bombastic already but you are going to look like an angel at first it is hard but you will get through it for me it was giving up ice cream but ben  jerrys dairy free peanut butter and cookies ice cream hits the spot and all of gardein chicken tenders are sooooooooo good too eat all you can and always know the fishies are always here for you and i love you lots i wish you amazing luck ps never starve yourself eat lots of grapes instead,1,NOT
here are my tips for you the most important tip is to eat until you get full do not try and eat as much as freelee you will feel sick  keep it simple  dont try to follow in sort of guidelines what i mean by this is do not eat a bunch of raw foods because its not pm yet  if following raw till  trust me you will end up over eating because you didnt have what you are craving just about everything can be made vegan if you get a craving have a little bit for example i crave pizza chocolate waffles etc what i do is look up vegan recipes where to find those vegan teams and eat them if i crave chocolate i buy the bar and i eat a square or two and then tuck it away for a rainy day  while any exercise is good exercise i recommend you do a little more than normal ex taking a morning walkjog as well as dancing  educate yourself it well help you build a deeper connection that way you stay on track if you get off track get back on youre gonna do great,1,NOT
also a quick tip for eating so much fruit you should add a protein in otherwise your body turns it to sugar so like banana and apple you should put it with peanut butter which is also a good filler,1,NOT
burrito bowls are amazing lots of rice beans lettuce corn ect ,1,NOT
gosh i hope she will not listen to people who says carb the fuck up and eat  calories a day no dont do that just eat whole foods plant based food like brown ricepotatoesbeannnsveggies proteinavocadonutsfruits and greens lots of greens,2,NOT
oh a vegan b supplement i recommend that actually tastes decent is from natural health goodies you can buy them on amazon highly recommend so you dont crash they are small chewable and arent nasty if you are like me and are worried about getting enough vitamins and minerals we arent all perfect vegans deva makes a good multivitamin that is quite tiny and easy to swallow again you can get them on amazon dont forget to drink tons of water d,1,NOT
fuck veganism saturated fat is healthy it doesnt clog arteries saturated fat is important for the brain and it keeps cell structures strong saturated fatty acids are also needed for important signaling and stabilization processes in the body saturated fat is required for calcium to be effectively incorporated into bone saturated fats found in butter and coconut oil myristic acid and lauric acid play key roles in immune health excess refined sugar vegetable oils and smoking are what damages arteries the body uses cholesterol to heal the damaged arteries since cholesterol is important for tissue repair,5,ABU

yay trisha im so glad youre going vegan the grapes are good but if you want a significant source of nutrients from them then you probably have to eat like one bag per day so i recommend not making the grapes into a meal but just having a few cups every day as a snack the bananas are good as well very good just make sure you eat them when they ripen because the bananas you showed in the video werent ripe and that amount was good for like one or two days if you really want to go seriously then those will not be enough for one day technically you are supposed to eat at least  bananas a day so take that into mind also freely eats like two or three of those bunches for breakfast the carrots are a good source of vitamin a but you should use those more in cooking than eating them raw just because its better to get all of your carbs in in the morning and then your vegetables are better later in the evening steaming the carrots corn green beans and other vegetables you like and pairing them with brown rice tastes very good watermelons are a good source of vitamin a c and will hydrate you but again the watermelon is better off as a snack and not a meal same with the cantaloupe most of the food you picked out is good for snacking and not really for meals you are going to want to pick up some dates mangoes potatoes brown rice almond milk or any other dairy substitute pasta is good chickpeas and lentils it is definitely recommended you eat raw in the morning and most of the afternoon and then cooked food in the evening if you think eating raw is too hard then just throw it all the fruit you want in a blender add a shit ton of water some almond milk if you want and some coconut sugar if you want also look up vegan recipes you can have for dinner and maybe even some desserts if you want dont worry about overeating as long as you are eating fruits and vegetables because you can have as much as you want without gaining weight of course after eating you will be bloated but it will mostly be water and after urinating your belly will go down its also good if you buy vegan multivitamins meant for vegans because if you are not very educated in nutrition you could end up with deficiencies i recommend the deva oneaday multivitamin  mineral i am glad you are taking this step and remember to eat if you are hungry and dont worry about calory intake you will not gain weight as long as you are eating right and remember always to carb the fuck up,1,NOT
you should eat fish,2,NOT
hey trish its so easy to eat vegan i know youre doing it for health reasons and thats a great start stick to whole foods the best u can and cut out or limit processed foods if u want to lose weight also you dont have to necessarily be an animal lover to be against animal cruelty so the fact that you have cut down your meat consumption is awesome and there are so many dairy alternatives that youre basically giving up nothing youre just eating the plant based and healthier version good luck and keep doing research on why going vegan is the best thing for your body the animals and our planet,1,NOT
why is trisha taking up freele out of nowhere smells like a big pile of ,5,ABU
being vegan was the best thing for me you can still eat a normal diet but substitute animal products it can be easy to eat veggie burgers and tofu but processed foods still arent the best i eat a lot of rice and beans thats very filling i put beans into my salad for protein i love to eat pasta and jarred tomatoes for dinner and just fruit throughout the day for snacking good luck,1,NOT
well you inspired me to try this diet but we will see after all this cheese pizza  cola digest then i will talk when youre not hungry youll give up any food lol,1,NOT

theres still plenty of foods that you probably eat daily that you wont have to give up and any time youd normally eat meat just replace it with a meat replacement like quorn  lots of crisps are still okay to eat and lots of biscuits are vegan too oreos are vegan theres also a ton of yummy dairy freevegan snacks in shops now in my local store theres a whole dairy free section vegan brownies are amazing especially after being warmed up in the microwave health stores normally have loads of vegan options too also subscribe to nature box or graze box you have the option to only let them send you vegan snacks and their stuff is delicious maybe you can get them to sponsor you too haha good luck trish it seems daunting at first but its really not as difficult as youd expect it to be if you can find the right foods it really doesnt have to be just veggies  rice,1,NOT

ive been a vegan for about  years now and im just gonna tell you it takes a lot of fucking patience the first month is gonna be like hell you have no idea what to eat and youre gonna feel like shot sometimes but after that its pretty damn awesome ive lost like kg and i can gain and lose weight pretty easily if i eat the right stuff unfortunately i love fried shit my tips are that you should start with being a vegetarian and eating less meat if you cut out all meat and shit like that at once youre just gonna binge on it later what me and a lot of my friends did then you should eat grains and beans so you get stuffed and get used to the calories oh and dont forget the bananas you better eat a lot of them the biggest mistake i probably made was threat i didnt really explore so much i basically ate the same things everyday and got bored so try out new things as often as you can it helped me lose the weight a lot faster too  i have no idea why love you,1,NOT
omg i never expected this you go girl youll feel great but dont try to go fully raw the first few days because youll feel restricted and youll just crash good luck,1,NOT
try imitation meat you can season it however you want and it is so good for people who are trying to cut out meat ive been vegan for about five months and balancing meals have been that hardest part carb up every morning eat bigger portions of carbs so that you dont get weak from hunger,1,NOT
you just need to eat a lot of greens like broccoli  salads cucumbers celery etc to get your digestive system going that way itll clean your digestive tract drink a lot  gallons of water and only water for your tummy to go down for the next  weeks and just cook healthy from home with goods carbs and keep the carbs low and keep your sodium intake low atleast a week before the shoot that way you dont hold water weight and get all bloated eat  calories a day just for the next two weeks and count them you can use myfitnesspal app make sure you get your protein in because it burns calories and just hop on that treadmill for   mins a everyday and your pounds will disappear good luck,1,NOT
wheat thins are vegan,1,NOT
if you want protein go for beans soy satan chickpea falafel amazing with hummus and fake meat if you want good luck,1,NOT
i really hope you can do it this time please remember its a lifestyle even if just for  weeks it includes no leather no animal products at all regardless of if its edible or not when you are vegan you need carbs you need to eat plentifully eating small amounts puts your body into fat storing mode never be hungry but eat the right things embrace the carbs avoid the fat and sodium if possible vegan isnt a diet its a lifestyle and you wont loose weight in  weeks if done properly first your body goes through detox from all the animal products then you may put on some weight as your body ajusts to eating well in time you will loose weight you loose weight slowly but it stays off unlike a fat diet in  weeks though your skin will glow and you will feel so good you wont care too much about weight anymore well done im proud of you soak up advice and welcome to a healthier happier you ,1,NOT

i have never clicked a video faster ive been vegan for around  months and it makes me feel and look so much healthier be sure to buy very dense fruits such as mangoes and dates  waterbased fruits have less calories and will leave you feeling pretty hungry throughout the day another thing you can make are vegan burritos with beans rice avocados and you can add beefless crumbles if youd like i  recommend gardein meat substitutes if you begin craving meat  their chicken tenders beefless burgers and pork sliders are so delicious remember to carb the f up potatoes rice and healthy breads and pastas are your best friend make sure to check the breads and pastas for eggs and milk they do not make you gain weight but provide glucose to your brain and keep you from being hungry throughout the day you should do a vegan taco bell mukbang everything there could be made vegan i love the  layer burrito with no cheese no sour cream and add potatoes and pico xx,1,NOT

it takes a little while before you start seeing visible results so be patient trish,1,NOT
veganism is good for numerous reasons but you cannot expect a body transformation in  weeks your body might retain some of the food you are eating since youve been starving yourself  naturally more water weight because the fruits  foods you will be eating naturally have more liquid you will definitely probably see results in your skin recommend foods potatoes  they will keep you full for a long time  dont have any fat instead of frying bake them  put spices on it  find a low fat sauce you can dip them in if youd like frozen smoothies in the morning just buy those frozen mix of fruits you see at the supermarket blend with a bit of water or almond milk  maybe some vanilla i wish you the very best on your vegan journey ,1,NOT

first of all congratulations your body wont magically transform in two weeks but youll feel so much better and youll see differences in your skin and overall health before i went vegan i struggled with multiple eating disorders i still struggle but the vegan lifestyle lets you eat in abundance which your body wants because the food you eat is your energy stay carbed up of course but also drink plenty of water at first i started to replace animal products with vegan products such as almond milk go veggie cheese earth balance vegan butter bagels daiya cream cheese boca burgers boca chicken patties gardien orange chickn oatmeal with maple syrup  peanut butter and vegan cereals humans are addicted to dairy and cheese so replacing them with a vegan option helps curve the cravings although all the food i mentioned is vegan junk food i just wanted to let you know that there is literally a vegan option for anything and that youre not missing out xo good luck,1,NOT

omg please do a mukbang it would be bomb affffffffff,1,NOT
i love you trish this is a great start but remember if you were on a restrictive diet chances may be you might gain it back to your healthy weight just warning you but when you do eat unhealthily and you start a vegan diet you make feel like shit may have breakouts this is actually just your body cleansing and yes fruits are the best way to lose weight has lots of carbs more than vegetables so keep in mind also dont buy packets of stuff youll probably just lazy and broke no joke just so to any produce section and buy a whole watermelon cantaloupe ect you definitely get your moneys worth again love you and have hope,1,NOT

for me personally i love starches more than sweets many vegans thrive on a fruity diet but for myself personally i enjoyed reading the starch solution by doctor mcdougall it resonates with me more just try multiple things as long as you are eating mostly whole foods you will feel better and be healthier make sure you are eating enough many people arent used to eating so much but vegan whole foods arent very calorie dense so you need to eat more and throughout the day eat lots of veggies and fruits potatoes are your friends  most vegans tend to eat high carb low fat good luck and persevere,1,NOT

regarding the lgbt community as a whole not every individual this is all part of the homosexual agenda you can be sure if not curbed it will weaken our entire nation im not at all hesitant to say i dont like them i dont and its their fault for overstepping their boundaries more precisely for their insatiable lust for children i might seem to be offbase until you explore an alternate perspective they have developed an obsession with presumed authority first they presumed to tell straight people that because we dont understand them and because we are uncomfortable with their relentless effort to integrate some form of conveying the hey look at me im gay message into everything they do we are mentally distressed and need counseling then they advanced to corrupting every television program with some form of homosexuality for example i turned on family guy one day the last show i watched regularly and suddenly stewie was gay to me in a modern family the grandparents are babyboomers and parents have tattoos and a mind that is not stuck in a s time warp a boy with  dads and no mom is my idea of a throwedoff family television stations do not have show directors to choose the shows they broadcast they have programming directors who choose the content with which they will program the audience children are a large part of the television audience the entertainment industry has no shortage of homosexuals there are even radio stations and probably television channels that broadcast only content from homosexual performers but if we try something like that they cry because we have violated their right to doublestandards now their lust for children they have demanded the children of the nation which they cannot produce be taught there are more than  genders not only that but they want to tell the other peoples children they can choose their gender leaving a child at home alone is dangerous but it pales in comparison to teaching a child lies in school where they go to learn the truth but lets go on and tell the kids the many genders homosexuals have created in their minds are  as real as the  that can be scientifically proven give the boys female hormones give the girls male steroids theres no reason a  year old girl shouldnt be taught how to put a condom on a lifelike latex penis right thats how the state of california sees it are you starting to see their lust for children yet do your best to convince yourself that will benefit the child as much as the sexually perverted pedophile give them all puberty blocking chemicals to allow them extra time to decide what they are honey if you identify as a toaster thats just fine daddy and daddy will still love you just as much as if you were a pixie or a fairy  i believe in equal rights however when the population of an entire state is forced to accept the fantasies of the mentally ill as reality and abide by laws that mandate promoting the lgbt agenda by teaching children these peoples delusions are reality while ignoring the majority of the population who actually produce the children that is far from equal and  rights what rights who gave them the right to lie to our children oh wait silly me it was obviously their fairy godmother so the result is that a champion female athlete is not only robbed of her status but robbed of her chance to earn a scholarship and maybe a better education than she can get without it because she has to compete against boys who want to dress like girls some girls might rely on a scholarship to go to college there have already been cases where girls in contact sports have been injured by boys dressing up as girls whats next you can be sure the girls are not the only victims though theyre just the first to take a hard blow those boys are in the spotlight now but according to statistics dark times are just a blink away and all for what it is nothing but lust for new meat that motivates the lgb whatever they are this week to recruit children it gets even worse there is a new movement of people seeking to become part of the lgb crowd they have labelled themselves maps are you ready for this minorattracted persons thats the long way to go about saying pedophile they believe it should be legal to  as long as they have the childs permission there was a time it was different but today the propaganda outright lies the selfpromoting content in every form of media and the aggressive recruiting campaign of the homosexual community has saturated every aspect of the nations childrens lives thereby bringing them down to the same disgusting level as pedophiles they dont care if these kids will become so confused and frustrated that theyll rent a gun and buy a bullet before they reach  no i dont dislike them for their sexual preference i despise them for the negative impact the children will feel due to their selfishness lack of respect for the nations youth and for their presumptuous attitude and actions,7,ABU

the sneaky part is how aware they are they know they arent girls otherwise they wouldnt have to identify differently than their gender the minute you have to explain why you dont identify as your gender you simultaneously confirm your knowledge of your own biology the true sportsmanship spirit would to be compete against your own biology and attempt to prove that youre still stronger than them,5,ABU

i heard you failed but to let you know you can eat beans rice pasta burritos vegan cupcakes pancakes veggie burgers vegan cheese so good except daiya i dont like it personally but you might literally for every meat there is a vegan substitute for it however dont eat mock meats like tofu everyday because it is somewhat processed and its better to steer clear every now and then quinoa and beans have protein and fiber theirs lentils and so much more,1,NOT
my favourite thing about this video is how trish was calling freelee beautiful and complimenting her out of all the controversial videos freelee has made the worst meanest ones have been about trish and yet trish will still say such kind things about her,1,NOT
yayyyy do not calorie restrict eat until you are  satisfied you will not gain weight also if you still want frappuccinos get them with coconut milk,1,NOT
highly recommend getting some transitional vegan options like gardein vegan chicken veggie burgers thinks like that you can also get vegan cheeses and great vegan milk alternatives i know you like eggs for breakfast so you can even try this new thing that you can get at whole foods called vegan egg or make a egg scramble but with tofu instead of eggs of course keep in a lot of fruit and try different ways to have veggies but dont forget rice and good carbs,1,NOT
make sure to eat your carbs and healthy fats but mostly carbs try and eat  calories and get that body moving you can do this,1,NOT
come on guys be nice to trisha she is trying also it would be amazing to have someone with as many views and subs as her in the vegan community,1,NOT
trish yaaaaaas omg im vegan and i will help you we will give u all the encouragement you need first things first make sure you are getting in your calories natural vegan foods are naturally low in calories so you get to eat more i cant stress it enough to eat enough because a lot of ppl tend to get weak from going vegan and blame it on not enough meat when really its because they arent getting enough calories so eat lol if you are eating whole plant foods u dont need to count calories just eat when ur hungry and stop when full you can easily get your protein through beans oats lentils even fruit has some protein so dont even worry about it plus we actually dont even need that much protein theres also tons of vegan products vegan meats vegan cheeses vegan ice creams find the ones you like i already know you like vanilla almond milk  hit us up trish if you need more help the only supplement i suggest u take is a small b pill thats it ur skin may even clear up too trish ur gonna love it,1,NOT
you should buy a lot of pasta potatoes and other good carbs d there are a lot of vegan meat substitutes that are really good like burgers and tofu and a lot of other stuff theres basically vegan options for like everything d,1,NOT

trishai love your videosbut slow down for the love of pete sometimes i cant understand what youre saying lolbut what helps a ton is watching what i eat in a day for vegans theres so much more than fruit to eat in your diet best of luck and record it please we would love to watch,1,NOT
the freelee is collab shit is wrong since she was talking bout u on a video,2,NOT
yass trish this is awesome,1,NOT
pls read this lol it may be helpful make sure you take vitamin b and get all the nutrients you need and youre probably gonna get cravings most people do at the beginning of their journey especially knowing you hehe so i recommend getting fake meat products such as gardein products theyre soooo yummy and make your cravings dissapear eat lots of beans and spinach and get yummy coconut milk ice cream or sorbet stuff its my favourite fucken thing and ugh just yummmmm and also its not an easy change its huge and takes commitment but if you stick with it you wonttttt regret it dont be afraid to eat a chicken nugget every once in a blue moon if thats what youre really craving cutting yourself off completely at all times especially when you first start out may just make you resent the vegan diet even morefor some people its better to just go cold turkeyor tofurkey in this caseand thats cool too youre still making a huge difference with this choice and im so happyyyy,1,NOT

your body will likely not transform in two weeks but eating mostly fruit and veggies will do wonders for your skin and digestion that said somebody else in the comments said not to eat only raw fruit and veg to start and id agree cause it will probably be too abrupt a change to stick to if you seriously want to try out the diet and help your health and aesthetics long term id start by going to vegan restaurants and trying well prepared vegan meals even the ones with fake meats cheese etc if youre adventurous and eating fruit and veg at home also it would be a good idea to allow yourself some vegan sweets as a transition im not a vegan activist and im not writing this to you because of your reach ive been dealing with disordered eating on and off for the last  years and since i went vegan some  months ago so much in my body and mind has changed for the better yes ive lost a bit of fat too and i hope it does for you too good luck,1,NOT

hey trish a vegan here  first off if you want to succeed you absolutely shouldnt even consider not eating as much as you want the only way you are going to gain weight on a vegan diet us if you eat oily fatty foods so if you want to lose weight as quickly as possible eliminate all overt fatsavocado nuts seeds coconuts etc that most of their calories come from fat also eat as much while foods as possible like ricepotatoes beans lentils oats and such those are going yo make you satiated and full for a looong time that packaged watermelon shouldnt even be a snack and it is not good a idea to eat it at lunch time bc melons have a high water content so they are best digested if eaten first thing in the morning otherwise you are going to be bloated and gassy for example you can eat fruit as breakfast for lunch you can make potato fries that you bake in the oven instead of dunking them in oil you can make rice stir fry with loots of veggies and rice again no oil there are endless recepies search around youtube also watch mrmrs vegan on youtube they are from la and have helped me a looot to understand how to eat properly and have very educational videos hope you continue this after the weeks aaand good luck ,1,NOT

dont eat light weight things like fruit and expect to fill up u gotta eat potatoes beans rice pasta grains this seems so lame and gross but u can make it taste so good like you said how those brussel sprouts were good  veggies are good when grilled esp green peppers let your body adjust to the new diet you may gain some weight at first just because youre taking in more calories but veganism will clean out your body and eventually youll be down to your bodys best weight it takes awhile if youre willing to try veganism or even vegetaraianism without dairy you will end up with clear skin and less weight but for most diets to be effective you have to exercise thats why freelee is so toned i dont know if youre even going to read this but im really proud of you definitely search some vegan recipes on youtube it makes it so much easier and eating fruit all day instead of filling fiberrich foods will leave you super hungry and undercarbed ,1,NOT

i am not vegan or vegetarian at the moment but i have been watching your vlogs for a while and i have a few ideas that i think could help i have noticed that you dont cook for yourself all that oftenwhich honestly i dont either lol however being vegan i hear that you have to learn how to cook or you will get really bored of the food you eat i think it would be smart to look at a lot of the vegan restaurants or healthy restaurants around your area and find out what you like if you do this you have somewhere to eat when you go out and you can always post mate it when you dont feel like cooking again i am not speaking from experience but i feel as though finding these restaurants will open your eyes to new vegan foods you might like and you would have no excuse to not eat vegan good luck trisha,1,NOT

i thought i was the only one who ate frozen grapes but i usually only eat them when my braces make my teeth hurt,1,NOT
my biggest advice is to start by eating normally meaning continue to eat the food you loved to eat before eat on vegan restaurants search for vegan replacement products etc to start with and get used to it to not feel like something is missing if you do good without it dont  but make sure to eat enough carbs proteins fiber calcium etc dont listen to supposed healthy diet that wont last long just as raw til  this one is made for people who want to maintain their weight or who have a hella fast metabolism which i guess is not yours just as it wasnt mine because i have always been rounder and this doesnt work for that type of body meaning that even if im thin i will still be rounder or curvier what works for me and people i know is just to continue eating normal and dont go with the extreme healthy vegan diets yet  raw diet raw til  good luck ,1,NOT

feel free to eat vegan alternative food they are generally healthier than meatdairy i just wouldnt recommend eating too much,1,NOT
you go girl my biggest tip for you would be to remember that there is not only one way to eat as a vegan the way freelee and many of the vegans in the youtube vegan community eat is amazing and super healthy but if its not interesting to you then dont forget that you can literally eat anything so long as its vegan oreos dairy free ben and jerrys basically any vegan junk  obviously thats pretty unhealthy to live off but my point is  just remember you dont have to restrict or deprive yourself of things you love if you feel like having some cookies or ice cream then why not  whatever keeps you vegan girl if you nourish yourself with staples like rice curries pastas potatoes etc chances are you wont even crave junk anyway  good luck,1,NOT
omg this make has made my day i mean i am vegan and i have seen freelees video and found out about her and she loved meat but now that she is vegan ya know it is so good that we are one person closer to animals being free i am so happy about her being vegan now and i hope every vegan can now support her even if she is just going to be vegan for to weeks as long as she tries i am so happy so keep going trsh keep going,1,NOT

doesnt blocking testosterone eliminate that advantage that everyone is talking about  testosterone is what makes your body grow and function like a typical mans body hair muscle growth all that is affected by testosterone if they no longer have testosterone and now estrogen  what girls have the advantage really isnt that big,1,NOT
quit victimizing them you fucks they do have an unfaur advantage,1,NOT
make them go on the boy tean,2,NOT
transgenders competing with women is it an unfair advantage  yes of course it bloody is they can identify as what the f they want but biologically they are male with male biological advantages lets debate this another way men vs women in tennis  women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in football  women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in rugby  women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in athletics  women not able to compete physically with men but in this liberal pc mentally ill world a man who has a chromosome abnormality resulting in nature causing her to be born a him can compete with women despite being biologically a man and having the physical advantages such as strengthendurance and stamina its like a athlete who uses performance enhancing drugs theres nothing fair about transgenders competing with women clown world,3,NOT
they are males tho,1,NOT
if this is acceptable then i can see males faking to be transgender in order to get scholarships its just a matter of time imagine michael stratham faking to be trans and competing in womens football,1,NOT
this is the problem people am always fall for emotions and never listen to logic,1,NOT
that is  unfair im not sexist cuz i know people will say i am but men are just born with more athleticism and just cuz she changes genders doesnt mean she loses her athleticism,1,NOT
xx  male xy  female end of discussion,1,NOT
why dont they want to compete against the boys there are hardly ever any restrictions that say girls cant compete against the boys if they can qualify this is a stupid as it gets the end result will be  transgender women dominating womens sports and then everyone will just lose interest if you are a girl why would you do all that training when you know you have to compete against a boy with long hair you cant win not even on a good day so you drop out this is the end of female sports but i think it will be a good thing because it highlights how stupid the whole argument is if you want to wear a dress that is fine but the dress isnt what makes you a woman in the same way a suit doesnt make you a man those things are just clothes and makeup somehow we are now confusing clothes and hairstyles and makeup for gender identity its absolutely ridiculous skirts never made a woman a woman and they cant make a man a woman either i think its all a devious plot to steal scholarships how progressive is that weve actually found a way as devious as it is to give scholarships that were meant for women to men this whole thing is absolutely sick i cant believe that any women especially feminists support this in any way ive seen how soccer clubs handle it and they will let the girls who qualify play on the boys team if they have no place else to put them that matches their ability but boys on a girls team absolutely unheard of and it doesnt matter how you self identify penis boys so we can make this a lot simpler until your penis and nut sack have been removed you are a boy your hair doesnt matter and neither does your skirt the scottish men have been wearing skirts for years they call them kilts but you dont see anyone accuse them of being girls because they are wearing a skirt kilt and trust me you wouldnt want to unless you are really good at fighting the scottish kilt does not transform the angry fighting man into a docile woman dont mess with him or he will mess horribly with you kilt or not,2,NOT
nope advantage like that one boxer its truth  i cant support this and im gay,1,NOT
theyre winning cause theyre dudes running against women,2,NOT
uh no shit its unfair thats not even a debate,1,NOT
they are great runners with a strong passion but seem to have the wrong conception of the reality of their own true gender i cant just believe yes means no just because i feel that way same thing for these two athletes they cant just believe being born male biologically means theyre girls because they feel that way feelings are important but you cant use feelings to block facts they are male they have male parts and have testosterone and theyre physical features are male like as well you cant just put on fake hair and believe that your officially a girl and run girl sports its okay to be trans its okay to change your body this way but it is not okay to lie about your true gender if you havent gone through any of the true major changes at the moment these two athletes have barely gone through any changes i mean its quite strange the fact that i can just go up to my track coach with fake long hair and tell them i wanna run for the girls although im biologically male,2,NOT
no boys dressed as girls,2,NOT
bruh im average asf and i smoked most of girls seniors included as a freshman testosterone is pretty much a legal steroid,1,NOT
why dont transgenders race against each other if they want to be fair and equal just like how most transgenders end up having relationships with each other,1,NOT
there going to ruin girls sports  dont have any genders let them all race together  wtf,3,NOT
everyone who said that is is unfair are sore losers,2,NOT
seeing it from the perspective of the millers this problem is a lot more complex than it seems,1,NOT
bone structure and joints have benefit of  years of male they are physical males period the irony is that it is mostly women to blame for this absurdity women need to stand up and fix this problem this issue is making a mockery of hard fought for female achievement,3,NOT
this is biology and not about socialpsych choices absolutely ridiculous that they are allowed to compete stop it now the iaaf has ruled on this,1,NOT
its unfair period you are biologically a boy and i am a liberal,1,NOT
breaking news male athletic star is faster than a female in the same sport coming up next the earth is round,1,NOT
no there is no compelling arguments on both sides why do we have to play this game of neutrality the fact that we have to wonder if transgender girls have an unfair advantage in womens sports means that we have lost all sense of common sense,1,NOT
there is not a single person in his or her right mind that things this fucken travesty is within reason you have two black males competing against white asian hispanic girls do they use the same lockers and show their big black dicks to the teenage girls all those tv personalities are too afraid of offending anybody by taking a stand as if they didnt have daughters of their own one of the fucken pieces of shit one of the black males said that the girls should try to run faster,5,ABU
we do it to ourselves and thats why it really hurts,1,NOT
women asked for this ,2,NOT
so are people saying boys are better than girls  so unfair  if you want to win you do the work  you get stronger  yo get faster  you win  but you do the work,1,NOT
there is no question about it they do have an unfair advantage the only question is why are they allowed to compete against girls,1,NOT
unfair males are physically stronger then most females because they have testosterone  some of yall saying yall are not transphobic etc we understand youre just giving your opinion as long as its not disgusting or prejudice youre good,1,NOT
i dont know why they keep pushing for this to be normalized when we know in the future it will always play out like this trans women constantly winning making bio women obsolete in their abilities to compete so what exactly are they trying to advocate for because that sure as hell dont sound like progress,2,NOT
transgender women are still male they are males always been what the fuck are we doing in ,2,NOT
they broth looks like males these  are in for it the money,2,NOT
of course it is an advantage transgenders should have their own class to compete in if we are going to be fair its not fair for men that want to be women who are still actually men to compete against actual women whats next transgender women competing vs women in combat sports and lifting competitions,1,NOT
this will not work out well for the pc crowd,1,NOT
im all for transgender right and fully support their life choices but we have to take a hard look at this biologically men are typically physically stronger than women this being said transgender is not transsex even if you go through hormone therapy this isnt about not being pc or descrimination this boils down to biology its not fair that a transgender woman who is biologically male can compete against biological females its just not even and its not fair to these athletes,1,NOT
lol arent women the most vocal supporters of lgbt yes let them be happy,1,NOT
to all the people saying that hormone therapy will make this fair why is it never girl to boy transgenders winning in sports they take testosterone  why is it only boy to girl transgenders winning stuff why is there no girl to boy transgenders playing in the nhl or nba well i can answer that for you because hormones and if not male bone density muscle mass larger frame more physical force and stamina there are also factors in our brainwiring such as men are more risk taking and agressive which would give them an edge if you insist that men compete against women in sports you are actively for eliminating womens sports thats just what it is either you feel sympathy for men who think they are women or you are for obliterating female sports thats your choice,3,NOT
fucken disgusting totally pathetic,5,ABU
its unfair period he still have the genetics of a male which makes him faster and stronger,1,NOT
why dont u freaks just find and island and u all go live there disgusting no wonder people cant stand u all,5,ABU

doesnt everyone start off as a girl the girl just transforms into boy im so confused,1,NOT
i identify as billie eilish my pronouns areduh i support transgender people as im trans myself,1,NOT
this is like alexandra trusova the figure skater identifying as a man and wiping the floor with the natural born men because she has superior flexibility and her quads are amazing it would be unfair in sports that favour women to allow biological women to compete as men against men as they have the more desired abilities and body shapes this applies to biological men competing in sports that favour masculinity as transgender women it simply isnt fair regardless of what anyone says,1,NOT
this is so stupid and unfair wtf,2,NOT
transgender womenwomen transgender menmen,1,NOT
it reminds me of the greatest duo in tennis history brothers serena and venus williams their biceps say all,2,NOT
okay so they are men who identify as women and use hormones which allows them to compete against women or people who identify as women im so confused,1,NOT
they shouldnt be treated as girlsthey will never be  they are boysthey are not poorthey are cheaters and they use their position to win that is itafter all this how can we like them and treat well,5,ABU

follow your heart is the most deceitful idea lucifersatan has put into the minds of mankind god says otherwise about sinful mankind and the motive of the heart jeremiah  the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it,1,NOT
this is coming from someone on the left your not the same as females your body produces more muscle mass you get taller you have more testosterone you are not built the same period i think there should be a transgender league how in the hell is someone who competed as a guy and never got within the top  in the races gonna go to female races and easily dominate that should say something,1,NOT
their chromosome makeup is xy  male we believe scientists on global warming why not biology,1,NOT

hey i was born a man but upon further stupidity i now identify as a fart so please dont hate me just accept my stupidity ,1,NOT
nobody is wondering anything basic biology dictates that they have an advantage,1,NOT
its very unfair that penis gives you testosterone which is an advantage run against men in your women clothes ,3,NOT
testosterone suppression is all well and good but it doesnt change the fact that having male genetics would have blessed these two with larger hearts larger lungs increased blood volume higher haemoglobin levels in their blood and on average increased basal metabolic rate longer limbs and denser bones to question whether or not they have a builtin advantage in the light of basic understanding of human anatomy biochemistry biomechanics physiology is absurd of course they have an advantage,1,NOT
hormone therapy cant change male anatomy and build,1,NOT
facts are facts they will never be females naturally this nonsense must stop now let them run with the boys da fuck is wrong with the world now remove them from the sport or create seperate fake shit for them since they are fake period,6,ABU
the trick is what if you cant win goldjust cut away ur penus and compete with girls and bag gold,2,NOT
who cares who you have sex with or how you identify this is a sport fact is if we had crazy monsters or beautiful angel faries or a new and ultimate super boring human there would be biological physical differences i mean id like to see the flip side interview with trans females to male in the nhl or nfl or something it would be an interesting piece to put it lightly so just add a category you dont even have to re invent the landscape if nobody is ashamed of how they identify and nobody is shaming them why not show up to cheer a trans friend on obviously referring to them as they identify male or female at their event the way you would a bio girl or a guy everyone is happy done funny the sjws are seemingly the only ones name calling here haha,1,NOT
born a man is a man competes with men,3,NOT
freaks the shouldnt allow them to run as girls,5,ABU
usain bolt needs to identify as a female so he can dominate the womens  m dash at the olympics well into his s,1,NOT

they dont even have tits,3,NOT
imagine having a guy compete in girls sports,2,NOT
i just noticed the like and dislike ratio lol,1,NOT
sorry women did this to themselves when siding with the intersectional feminists no sympathy you made your bed no lay in it,3,NOT
they should be competing in against men or other transgenders and not against women,5,ABU
i totally understand that you feel you are a woman inside and you have the right to express that but you have to be honest with yourself you were born with physical advantages that clearly set you apart from cis women,1,NOT
jesus created boys and girls satan is really working hard disrespectful too the most high i put a porsche bumper sticker on a dodge took it too the porsche dealer its confirmed that its still a dodge,3,NOT
theyre men ofcourse theyll be at an advantage against women,1,NOT
they should be able to run with female runners they have taking treatment for testosterone so whats the difference,1,NOT
yea this isnt fair testosterone has some major effects on the body if they were castrated maybe but if they still have testicles this isnt fair,2,NOT
of course it is unfair that is the reason why men and women have always competed separately if transgender want to compete compete against each other not other women or men they have too much testosterone to compete against women,1,NOT
more dislikes then likes,1,NOT
as a transwoman i must say that even if i were to train and train and train every single one of those ciswomen could leave me in the dust in a sprint race  and i have very long legs the notion that transgender women have an unfair advantage over ciswomen in athletics is just not realistic,3,NOT
girls you always say youre equalstop the bitching,5,ABU
it is an unfair advantage just cuz your mind says girl,1,NOT
im a werewolf,1,NOT
two transgender black man they obviously going to win,3,NOT

the parents are reeeeally fucked in the brain to uphold these wrongdoings,5,ABU
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yeah actual science still is relevent abc,1,NOT
i just want to see a woman become a man and dominate men,1,NOT
lol  men beat women in a sport,3,NOT
saying that the coaches are welcoming them is probably the dumbest defence ive heard of course they are theyll never lose a race,2,NOT
girls showd refuse to compete against this two guys lets see if they keep pushing this nonsense gender identity rules that keep this guys killing it in girls sports,2,NOT
this has absolutely nothing to do with someone being transphobic this is simply whats fair and whats not and these two athletes have a definite unfair advantage over the other girl athletes this is about whats right and whats wrong and this is wrong on all accounts im all for you being whoever you want to be and whoever you choose to identify as but if that choice puts you in an advantageous situation over another then thats when its cheatingperiod,1,NOT
her parents are complete idiots  its not fair to everyone else so you should remove your freak daughter,6,ABU
i identify as a baby boa,2,NOT
this isnt considered cheating but using steroids is,2,NOT
definitely unfair guys are faster than girls,1,NOT
 theyre happy  in turn making me happy  so why dont we keep the people calling for you to run on the side where biology states you should be happy to make everyone happy and in turn making you happy,1,NOT
metoo where yall at when your really needed and stop referring to these mistakes as she and her,5,ABU
biologically unfair af,1,NOT
this is so wrong on so many levels why are the parents not talking about how the transgender did actually try to race the on the boys track team and didnt do well and that is why they went to the girls track team,2,NOT
but this is trash and very stupid insensitive and unfair why do females who turn to male not partake in male sport i guess we know the answer to that because they cant keep up the way our bodies are formed are very different and that wont change even if they refuse to acknowledge the body in which they were born into their own sport should be made they still retain their muscles and a whole lot of other stuffs that is the composition of a male body its a big disadvantage to people been born female ,2,NOT
the transgender issue is being pushed on us they want to created a genderless raceless religionless society,1,NOT
look look at your dislikes thats a clear message,1,NOT
thats so fucked up where are womens rights now,1,NOT
what happens to a girl caught injecting herself with male hormones she is excluded from the competition well thats the very same thing,1,NOT
stop the earth rn im getting the fuck off ,1,NOT
even in porn they have categories just an example as funny as it sound they have an award for best female pornstar and an award for best shemale pornstar if they wanna compete the state should create another category for transgenders female or male im sure that will be more fair and thats not discrimination it just common sense,1,NOT
of course both of these transgendered boys well they have not transitioned so they are boys would say that it is not fair for them because they are not thinking of others but want everyone to think about their situation which they chose us women were born women and had to fight to title ix and respect in the sports field while they are taking advantage of the fact that they are still male physically something else us women have to fight against,3,NOT
she is a hater and then dont they take hormone therapy so it going to replace testosterone rt,2,NOT
how you gonna have a penis racing against girls,3,NOT
 how deluded do you have to be to say something like that holy cow,5,ABU
its simple men are provenly dominant physically to women so just because these transgenders mentally are women that doesnt mean that they are physically women so therefore is like putting a male to compete against females,1,NOT
im no heterosexual but i still think and feel like this is very unfair all of the observable science points to that fact you can literally find more testosterone in those dudes than the other ladies out there like wth im so confused and to all of the leftist out there shouldnt you be supporting women from toxic masculinity to the equality of the sexes there are so many contradictions i dont get it are you just trolls or am i really missing something is this a joke or what i am so confused,1,NOT
science  your feelings,1,NOT
i thought men and women are the same aha,1,NOT
so hypothetically speaking a floyd mayweather could enter the ring with a claressa shields,1,NOT
some dumb segment,3,NOT
its milli vanilli all over again ,1,NOT
keep girls out of boys clubs teams etc and then you wont have boys doing the same to girls clubs teams etc lol you idiots opened this can of worms so stop bitching and crying and move on with your life ,5,ABU
when you see them run its so obvious that they physically have an advantage as a result of their biological gender all for them being transgender but i would be upset too,1,NOT
gma youre ridiculous this is absolutely unfair i like how they say they just worry about the well being of the transgender teens what about the well being of the real girls,3,NOT
i think if they want to compete they should have to wear a set of balls hanging out the back of their pants like on jackass,1,NOT
this is what happens when you have no daddy you want to become your mom or grandma,2,NOT
this is like a man taking alot of steroids,3,NOT
its about more than just winning a metal for some girls they work their asses off to compete and have a chance to become an elite athlete and thats being taken away i support equality but isnt what equality is this is going to ruin womens sports its sad to see after years of women fighting to just be able to play sports at all and be respected and now this ,1,NOT
when the one athletes like if theyre happy that should make me happy but thats really not how it works in sports like oh yeah if the other team is happy about our pitcher being down i should be happy too ,1,NOT
how ridiculous they decided they were girls they decided they wanted to participate in girls sports im sorry you cant decide to have a chromosomal structure that you have,3,NOT
i dont even know where to start with thid,2,NOT
they should not be able to compeat agenst biological women,5,ABU
the well being of the children should triumph no one wants to be transgender believe me,5,ABU
they can also do more pull ups push ups and sit up than those born girls the girls who came in rd and th place are the real st and nd place winners i have absolutely nothing against the transgender community be who you feel you are in your soul but come on this should be a no brainer this shouldnt even be a debate,1,NOT
wnba is gonna be lit in a few years,1,NOT
is this the equality they wanted,1,NOT
unfair and wrong they went through puberty as a boy bone density and size is different should be no further discussion,3,NOT
girls athletics will soon be completely destroyed because of this nonsense if you have xy chromosomes everywhere except for half of your sperm you are a male if you have xx chromosomes you are a female period thats science i dont care what hormones you take or what you take to supress other hormones i dont care if you mutilate your body to change your outward appearance i feel tremendous empathy for your confused feelings but your feelings dont change the fact that you are physiologically male males should compete against other males females should compete against other females to do otherwise flies in the face of science and gives a tremendously unfair advantage to boys pretending to be girls maybe its time to add two more categories to student athletics boys who think they are girls and girls who think they are boys then the playing fields are level and no one has an unfair advantage,3,NOT
you fucking abominations,6,ABU
when the one girl mentioned that she was looking at social media comments about her the reporter said some of those comments were harsh like saying terry and andrea had an unfair advantage because they were boys thats not a harsh comment at all thats just someone stating the facts theres a reason they have separate sporting events for men and women theres a reason they have the womens record and the mens record in track and field one of the trans girls mothers commented during her interview it allows her to be who she wants to be and that has more weight than winning a medal not to the girls competing against her who are trying to get college scholarships its great that she has loving supportive parents but i hope people realize this is a complicated issueand being against them competing in state finals has nothing to do with being anti transgender,1,NOT
i agree with the state rules of those  states it makes the most sense however i dont think trans people should be completely prevented from competing with the gender they are transitioning to its a slippery slip but it just reminds me of the argument of it being unfair that blacks are competing with other races because they naturally are faster so its unfair,1,NOT
so one has a gay father and a transgender mother both of them look like boys in drag this why the trans community gets push back these biological boys with hormone additives shouldnt be competing in a race with biological girls,5,ABU
except youre femininefine except you like what other women like fineyoure still a man acceptance is a big part of life and santa isnt real,2,NOT
its like gold plated vs gold just because something is dressed up in gold doesnt mean its gold through and through they should be ashamed of themselves,5,ABU
if youre really that butt hurt about it then get better and win instead of complaining,3,NOT
ive seen trans girls run tht look like a man and identify as a male and they ran with women soo this should be the same they r natural born men tht identify as a female they should run with other boys,5,ABU

veggies veggies veggies girl when im vegan i think of myself as a vegetarian with limitations eat loads of cooked veggies you can do soooo much with veggies broccoli steamed chopped in dishes green beans garlic and olive oil or coconut oil cauliflower spaghetti squash as pasta garbanzo beans are great they are good in a stew w vegatable stock or water beans tomato loads of fresh herbs chili powder garlic onion zucchini carrots etc i find that when you chose a healthy lifestyle like this it forces you to cook all your meals its much easier that way fruits are cool too but its really important to eat a veggie or two w each meal,1,NOT
so proud hope it works out love you,1,NOT
rice with steamed vegetables or homemade potato wedges were my go to during the first month of becoming vegan they are super filling and really yummy i wish you luck on this crazy journey keep in mind that eating vegan isnt the hardest thing you will feel left out at times because people around you might be consuming animal products dont let that get to your head youre doing this for you i cant wait to hear how it goes c,1,NOT
this is an old video check the nails girl ,1,NOT
dont be afraid to eat too much some people end up gaining or losing a lot of weight when starting out as a vegan so dont expect to loose a bunch of weight in  weeks it takes a while to make progress so take it slow and be patient itll pay off and youll feel and look great,1,NOT
here are my tips dont be shy to eat a lot eat until you are satisfied yay  eat your favourite fruits  veg bananas dates melons and avocados are my staples as they are calorie dense super yummy and versatile for carbs go all out rice pasta potatoes quinoa couscous bread cereal etc for protein i love beans lentils tofu nuts peanut butter but there are lots more options too you can find great meat options like the brand gardein  tofurky delicious also give smoothies and banana ice cream a try im sure you will love it ,1,NOT
potatoes rice and veggies,1,NOT
the caramel latte from starbucks is my go to i just make sure that its done with soy milk and it tastes so good it tastes so much better than actual milk from cows,1,NOT
sooo proud of u trish,1,NOT
hey trish i just went vegan too and i have a few tips  eat a ton i started out counting my calories because i wasnt eating enough calories i recommend mynetdiary in the app store if you want to count your calories i once ate  calories in one day dont be afraid to overeat if the food is healthy you can eat as much as you want  make healthy foods you dont like taste delicious i hate bananas but if i freeze them blend them up in a high speed blender with cocoa powder and almond milk it turns out like ice cream  to start out stock up on dairy free milks almond milk is my favorite vegan butters vegan chocolates and vegan snacks to cure those cravings they eventually go away,1,NOT
thank you  thank you thank you thank you for what youre doing  ,1,NOT
i feel like you could make really cool videos like vegan burger king taco bell etc and also junk food vegan like oreos most biscuits are vegan,1,NOT
maybe it would help you loose weight i know people go vegan as a diet,2,NOT
another parallel between you and i trish i am too attempting to go vegan i hate meat  dont like eggs the only think im having a hard time with is dairy milkcheese i love me some fruits and veggis and nuts and rice and beans etc my downfall is sugar which technically is ok to eat when vegan so i need to find some self control on that front the common mistake i am making is just like when you said you accidentally had starbucks that had milk you have to break the bad habits one good thing is that there is so many channels and websites out there to help you know what to eat i suggest before going to any food restaurants ie taco bell starbucks cheesecake factory etc you check out their menu online and figure out what you will order prior to going i know its easy to be caught up in the whole process and order things that you used to order or you get there and you dont want to hold up the line so you order something without thinking it through you have to remember that its easy to go vegan and stay fat trust me i know this i too am about lbs too and i too hope to get healthier through going vegan french fries are vegan but when you get them say from mcdonalds or bk they are soaked in salt then salted again and again and again when being served then the fried aspect on top of that i know you know this i just used that as an example  usually hardcore vegans arent vegans to be skinny they are vegan because they are against all animal cruelty then the health benefits are just a plus you can get vitamins too to help you make sure youre getting everything your body needs maybe freelee can help with telling you which you should take while doing this  week vegan diet love you bunches trisha and i know you can do it dont cheat,1,NOT

for going vegan try to stick with whole foods as much as possible for the best results eat lots of vegetables like piles of vegetables and eat lots of fruit too a great way to get protein in lentils and beans also edamame pasta or black bean pasta is very high in protein there are also vegan protein powders and tofu and setian which is a made from wheat and lentlis and red beans this product is very high in protein there is tempeh too and also nutritional yeast also high in protein is chia seeds is around  grams or so protein for  tablespoons even though its high protein ist also high in fats its a good fat but for plant based diet you want to keep your fat low dont consume too much of it i hope this was helpful and i hope your journey is successful  ive eben vegan for  weeks now and i keep my protein high because i lift and want to keep my musle and i dont really low fat so far it works for me ,1,NOT

larabars theyre super yummy and theyre nice to have as a quick snack through the day when youre feeling peckish i love eating rice with some potatoes and onions and other stuff but going vegan is all about getting creative with your meals the meat and dairy industry is so huge that it makes it nearly impossible to just go to the store  be able to grab some food without worrying if its vegan or not whole foods will be your best friend pasta is yummy and sooo filling potatoes rice and beans are always great just be careful when i started out vegan i got the same advice but for some reason i never thought to add anything in to my food to make it taste better so more often than not i was sitting there eating plain rice and getting full but hating what i was eating imagine if you just cooked a burger patty but didnt add any spices or literally anything at all to it and just ate the cooked ground beef not yummy same applies to vegan food if you dont spice it up pun intended itll definitely make you start to resent going vegan i recommend following lots of twitterinstagrampinterestyoutube accounts that are vegan so you can stay motivated and find new tasty recipes i know im not the only one whos obsessed with those buzzfeed cooking videos so its the same concept you see something tasty you want it just make sure its vegan good luck girl you might get discouraged at times but thats completely natural keep your end goal in sight stay positive and love yourself you can do it ,1,NOT

i wouldnt exactly say that you can eat as much as you want without gaining weight or even for weight loss normally the amount you want to eat is equal the amount you need if you dont have disordered eating habit though if you have been restricting for so long then you might want to eat more than you need which results in gaining weight but this shouldnt scare you off since you need your body to gain that weight in order to cure the metabolic damage and increase your basal metabolic rate and eventually youll be at an optimal weight for your body type hope this was helpful ,1,NOT

oh god not another,2,NOT
and btw the weight falls off effortlessly like i wasnt even trying to lose weight and lsot so much at first,1,NOT
nonono you cannot eat as much as you want when you have the mindset of wanting to lose weight calories in vs calories out you need to be in a calorie deficit in order to lose weight eating food will not make you lose weight no matter what any miracle website out there tells you find out what your maintenance calories are the calories required to stay at your current weight and then eat under that there are  calories in one pound so as long as your total caloric deficit per week is around there you will drop a pound per week which is healthy also do not let these hclf people tell you avoid fat no fat you need fats in order to absorb certain vitamins and it aids in protein synthesis which helps build tissue  produce cells make sure youre doing this in a healthy manner do more research and find out what it is that you need to do i weight lift on a higher carb vegan diet  of my calories comes from carbs and it works for me so i can tell you that doing the lifestyle right will produce great results that you can stick to but if you do this completely blind youre gonna end up hitting a wall because someone turned you onto a vegan fad diet understand what macro and micronutrients are what they do to your body and how they work in sync with others make sure youre getting what your body needs depriving yourself will put your body at great risk understand calories in vs out etc etc just be smart about this and it will work trish good luck ,1,NOT
you might gain weight at first because your body is healing from old eating disorders but after that your probably lose a lot of the weight once everything evens out,1,NOT

when freelee says you can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet she means that if youre eating nutrient rich foods ie fruits vegetables legumes starches and a little of fats like avocado you can eat as much as you want because those foods are less calorically dense than meat and dairy and fats if you go vegan and eat fried french fries oreos or foods that are vegan imitations of nonvegan foods youll gain weight,1,NOT

even as a trans person i think this is unfair like i would get it if they transitioned before they went through male puberty because then it would be equal but they have gone through male puberty and science is science they have an advantage,3,NOT
gtfohand go join a boys track team,5,ABU
totally unfair this shoyld not even be a discussion,5,ABU

this is sad but it is true im  and i use to run track in high school too i was second best on my team i know how it feels to be a woman athlete and im bisexual so im all for the lgbt community but ill be damned if a trans woman come and take over and me becoming rd best on the team because shes a man that shit aint right im sorry but its not im all for equality but its not right for us natural women our bodies are physically different from theres weather they use hormons or not we cant beat a trans woman cause they are technically men thats crazy to me i understand both sides of this story but at the end of the day it is fucked up how now a days women got to go through this it isnt fair this equality act is giving inequality real talk,5,ABU

i dont care what you call yourself i really dont if you want to be called a she ill call you a she no complaints but the average man is a better athlete than the average woman the best male athlete is a better athlete than the best female athlete this is fact this means that the category you compete in should be dictated by biological sex,5,ABU

please stick to it trish it is so important i have been vegan for a few months and it has made me so much happier whenever you struggle just remember this  happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony if you have even a small amount of compassion for animals which clearly you do this lifestyle will make you appreciate all other species so much more and appreciate life in general just try to listen to your body if you arent hungry then dont eat if you are hungry then eat even if you just ate a meal dont expect to lose a ton of weight initially your body like mine has a lot of metabolic damage caused from restriction and starvation that will take a little while to reverse be patient with the lifestyle and most importantly remember that it is a lifestyle and not a diet ,1,NOT

a big reason for you to go plant based trish would be your mental health i cannot stress how much it helped my mental health all this processed foods and animal products you eat really do damage inside your body which has an effect on your brain chemistry and because you barely eat real food fruits and veg your body doesnt get the nutrients it needs to be healthy and because you often starve yourself your brain doesnt get the energy it needs truly eating mostly real food and plant based foods will do so much good for your mental health because your brain will get the energy your body the nutrients the inflammation in your body will lower this all has a huge effect on your brain and thus your mental health,1,NOT
trish one thing that could help your new vegan lifestyle could be going on walks i know one thing is i joined a cross country team in th grade i used to run a  min mile but now i run a  min mile walking is a great step to running running has so so so many good things about it anybody can do it no matter the size cause i know i wasnt the skinniest in cross country it can also improve your mood and lastly it is a very effective way to be healthy i know that if you do want to work on this and be able to continue it you have to start slow and be patient i know that i never was near the front even when i was improved but that doesnt matter what matters is that your time improved if you do want to start this activity i recommend first walking maybe half a mile every day for about  days then you try to runjog a full mile i remember running my mile for the first time i would stop every  mins probably one way to gain back energy but not stop and take a rest is just by slowing down even if you have to walk to gain energy back your still going somewhere and continuing anyway if you do want to do this practice walking then you need to try your hardest to runjog a mile when doing the mile you need to have a timer going when you are done with your mile and have your mile time write it down somewhere you will always see it and then when you go on more runs you can easily figure out how fast youve gotten how long it would probably be to go an extra distance i also recomenned getting a certain type watch fitbit orsomething like it or getting a app on your phone one thing that gets me motivated to run is getting new running gear i recommend not ordering online the prettiest one by a over the top brand but instead find a local running gear store near you and get you walk checked and feet checked to find the perfect shoe for your feet that will help so much i hope you get to see this advice love you blndsundollmj,1,NOT
some great vegan sources of protein are beanslentilslegumes especially in combination with grains like rice or buckwheat tofu is a good protein source seitan or wheat meat is also great if you have timeinterest you can make it at home very cheap and easy but you can also get it at most health food stores eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables most of which for the record also have protein in them i wouldnt worry too much about protein in general most americans actually eat close to twice the recommended amount in a day its pretty easy to get enough definitely do some research on getting the nutrients you need because at first it can be difficult but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy if youre having cravings there are some good substitutes for meat and dairy products that you can get and vegan desserts are definitely a thing  there are so many great vegan recipesrecipe blogs online you can find recipes for everything from super healthy raw food to vegan triple chocolate cake some of my personal favorites are chickpea salad sandwiches stir fry and fajitas and dont feel bad about getting stuff in packages you dont have to o everything all at once start with whats easier for you,1,NOT

if u dont want to cut out dairy a good way to get rid of a huge pimple is to rub ice on it and then put some eye drops that are for red itchy eyes on it and the ice will make the puffiness go down and the eyedrops get rid of the redness this is a life saver cause on the day of my choir concert i was singing a huge solo and i got a pimple i used this trick and it went away,1,NOT

hey trish dietary pointers from a vegetarian of  years and a vegan of   beans beans beans are high in fiber essential proteins other nutrients like iron and amazingly low in calories there are a wide variety of beans the most recognizable probably being chickpeas used in hummus and kidney beans despite having a poorer stigma kidney beans are absolutely delectable prepared right i actually have images of kidney bean tacos on my ig  lehind  anyway be sure to explore the beans there is inevitably going to be at least one that you find enjoyable  nuts though high in calories nuts supply essential fatty acids walnuts are known to boost neuron activity in the brain for example  pasta eat pasta pasta is extremely high in protein and caloric it is a grain of course buying a pasta with the least amount of ingredients displayed on the side is recommended the simpler the healthier will facilitate finding a dairyfree product as well also a note glutenfree pasta is actually calorically lighter than regular pasta i dont require glutenfree products but i enjoy the taste of glutenfree pasta  for dairy free cheese products and the like look at brands like earth balance daiya and all the others search dairy free cheeses and dairy free milks on google theres a wide array of milks for example all differing in taste and consistency soy milk almond milk cashew milk pea milk hazelnut milk oat milk flax milk rice milk hemp milk etc  commercial sweets i know of to be coincidentally vegan are vanilla oreos nutter butters etc look that up too mainstream vegan sweets  products or even vegan junk food obviously best in moderation  most chips are vegan,1,NOT

its also okay not to put a label on your diet if this doesnt work out instead of saying shit ill start tomorrow that had dairy or i ate meat by mistake guess thats it its not about winning an award for the longest streak of no meat or dairy its about making healthier choices i cut out red meat like  or  years ago and yes ive had a few slip ups by accident but honestly my body is so much healthier and happier when im fueling it right so dont worry about a specific label of vegan or vegetarian live in the moment eat what makes your body feel good and that will make all the difference,1,NOT
am i the only one who actually understand what trisha is saying here she said she is starting tomorrow like theres no discussion to be had doesnt matter if she had nonvegan pizza today shes starting tomorrow doesnt matter if this is infact three weeks old shes starting tomorrow the date it was recorded doesnt matter she said tomorrow which applies strictly to the date this video was uploaded,1,NOT

morning star gardien boca burgersthose are all amazing brands ,1,NOT
the thing about vegan is that its litterally no animal type food whatsoever like no eggs milk ofcorse chicken hamburgers etc soups n tbings like that and because you arent eating eat you definitely have to find a good source of protein so like lotssss of beans and sometimes vegans will have to take protien supplements but have to watch what they are other than that just making sure you are balanced then you could probably eat as much as you want there are also other diets like the kill catch grow method which is if you dont kill catch or grow it then dont eat it or there is paleo or vegetarian plenty of things to try just really have to find what works for you so that if you want to then you could have it be a life style instead of just a few weeks type of thing ,1,NOT

so proud of you trish its so great that you want to eat healthfully instead of starving yourself to loose weight please remember though that you might not loose weight within two weeks and i hope youll stick with veganism anyway we all know that weight loss doesnt happen overnight and takes months or years so please dont give up on being vegan if you dont see fast results my tips for being and staying vegan are  fuck all the vegan diets like rt sorry freelee fully raw etc all you need to do is eat whole plant foods by this i mean basically anything from the produce section of the store also beans legumes lentils pasta rice oats  try new things find a recipe that looks yummy and make it try to veganize your old favorites try the vegan meatcheese alternatives know that there will be things you love and things you hate but thats just a part of the process  prepare food ahead of time make sure you have something to snack on or have lunch prepared before you get hungry so you dont give up and get fast food or something this also applies to going out to eat research the menu ahead of time so your not flustered when you get there  read all the labels every single packaged thing you buy please read the labels never assume that something is vegan companies love to sneak milk fat or skim milk into everything  its not just about you i know you are doing this mainly for health reasons which is completely fine but its so helpful to remember and think about all the lives you are saving by eating this way when it gets tough just know you are helping animals and the earth  i really hope this helps you trish im so happy for you ,1,NOT

trish i really hope youre not trolling if youre not im so proud of you this is the best decision youll ever make my suggestions for protein beans lentils tofu soy protein powder and faux meat products dont be afraid of those there are lots more but those are the main ones i eat gardein meat products are always delicious most realistic taste and texture in my opinion makes it easier to transition my main advice make sure youre getting enough calories eat until youre full you can literally never eat enough fruits and vegetables also vegan junk food is a thing enjoy it but dont make it a staple in your diet  good luck,1,NOT
trish this might be a new chapter in your life xoxo keep going girl ,1,NOT

carrots and hummus is amazing also anything morning star and also when you go to starbucks if you must cause thats all sugar just ask for soy milk to replace the dairy dont put salt on your food at first your tongue needs time to adapt and youll soon realize that veggies will actually seem to have changed taste perceptively also ben and jerrys has vegan ice cream that fuckin kills it,1,NOT
welcome to the journey,1,NOT
didnt freelee just post a slam video about trisha a few weeks ago like she was such a b about it and i like trisha i couldnt bring myself to watch any more freelee videos,1,NOT

youre fortunate in living in la because theres plenty of restaurants also theres pretty much a vegan alternatives to most animal products in case you get cravings,1,NOT
im not vegan but i try and cut out as much as i can i dont drink milk eat yogurts i have non dairy butter i dont eat beef or pork or anything you can get almond milk which i think is so nice on its own and you can use it for cereal and coffee you can get great vegan alternatives and i always try to substitute when i can,1,NOT
trolling video is almost a month old,2,NOT
you go trish load up on carbs pastabreadpotatoes etc that will keep you full and you wont have to eat as much or as often for protein beans are amazing make sure you have food ready so when you cook make huge batches ,1,NOT

hey trish awesome youre trying a veganplant based diet people always tell me i cant do this but you never know until you try it so you go girl make sure to eat lots of potatoes rice pasta vegetables and fruits and a vegan burger and a vegan donut cant hurt anybody once in awhile  make sure to eat lots of carbohydrates and low fat and did you know that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich actually contains more protein than certain meats how crazy is that anyway trish love that youre doing this we really appreciate it,1,NOT
i love you so much and i am so happy that you are doing this and i hope that this works out amazing for you ,1,NOT
morning protein shakes with soy milk is great and also look up vegan for starbucks for coffee also most cereal is vegan already so just soy milk will help with breakfast and stir fry veggies are so fucking good also french fries are great for snacking  and peanut butter is good for protein as well,1,NOT

hey im a sexy vegan bodypillow,2,NOT
trish my advice would be to eat many meals a day to increase your metabolism and to eat a lot of fruit for your digestion,1,NOT
hey im a vegetarian but most of the time in practically vegan i eat dairy maybe twice a week or so and i looovee vegan food because you can get socreative with it its really hard for many people to transition especially whn youre a meat fan and stuff you were asking about other foods besides fruit that you can have on a vegan diet and i can give you some ideas whicha re totally delicious and most people who eat meat love these as well and dont realize they are eating a vegan meal when they eat these pasta prepared vegan in a million ways bread whole wheat is so much better for youre health and physique sorbet this is a great replacement for ice cream vegan icecream yup there is vegan ice cream made with vegan milks that taste just as good rice you can make veggiefried rice vegetable curry my personal favorite quinoa which is an amazing and super delicious protein packed meal it can be prepared in different ways as well cold hot peanut butter make sure to get all natural or make your own at home by blending roasted peanuts w no salt dont add water almond rice soy milk frappucinos with soymilk putting caps so you know you can still drink those fraps girl just ask for soy milk or rice milk nuts walnuts peanuts pistachios almonds these are great protein packed snacks they also have healthy fats cereals check the package says vegan and low sugar is the best option vegan cheese almond cheese resembles mozzarella vegan yogurt made with almond or coconut milk acai bowls papaya bowls with no yogurt pitaya bowls hummus great for snacking with crackers carrots celery cucumber etc mashed potatoes broccoli cauliflower etc with no cream oatmeal cna be prepared in so many delicious ways use almond coconut or rice milk or water so this is all that i could think of at the moment i really hope you can get back on track with veganism because its not only great for you but also for the environment my recommendation is checking out some vegan restaurants near where you live do so through yelp or google it so you can see how many different delicious options are placed on the menu and maybe you can get some ideas to cook yourself at home believe me veganism is great and fruit is not the only option you have for food and what i love the most about it is that you can get so creative with everything quick heads up marshmallows gelatine and gum are made with grenetine which comes from animal bone marrow not vegan of course and quite disgusting but there are vegan marshmallows which actually taste pretty good vanillaish and theres vegan chewing gum as well there are infinite vegan desserts that you can make too its all about looking for recipes online unless you are the most creative person on earth at the kitchen i hope this helps a lot and i hope that you can last as a vegan now knowing that fruit isnt the only thing we eat haha,1,NOT
trish i love grapes but freeze them and they taste like ice cream ,1,NOT

yes go trish fruit is great but personally when i went vegan cooked food was easier when transitioning to lots of rice veggie stir fries are my go to if you are trying to loose weight try to stick more to whole foods and less to processed fake meats and cheeses cuz they have a lot of fat and salt usually but dont be too hard on yourself eat whatever you feel like as long as its cruelty free  you can do it,1,NOT
i feel like this is old footage because i am part of the snapchat fam  but good luck if youre starting over now for the next two weeks hugs,1,NOT

secret to not gaining weight on this diet is simple eat when youre hungry  stop when youre full dont stuff yourself  stop when ur satisfied pretty easy ,1,NOT
go to mc donald,1,NOT
first off tricia you are beautiful no matter who is standing next to you or what the number of the scale says as far as food goes no need to worry about protein all plant foods contain adequate amount of amino acids and as long as you eat a variety of plants you will meet your protein needs worrier any problem the most important thing to remember is to limit as much fat as you can and load up on carbohydrates youll have to get over your fear of carbs such as pasta breads and potatoes and rice  and of course fruit too but that wont be enough calories for you longterm make your food tasty maybe look up some delicious recipes such as curry stir fry or go on youtube or on freelees channel also i would highly recommend going to vegan restaurants so you can still enjoy delicious food and not feel deprived,1,NOT
though fruits are definitely healthy and good for you they contain sugar and some are higher in sugar than others i remember grapes being one of them i think you need to be careful of the amount of fruits you eat good luck with the diet ,1,NOT

sightrish you say youre done with trolling and want to stop making problematic videos and yet here you are going vegan isnt the same as a diet where you say youre gonna cut out red meat or carbs its a lifestyle the lifestyle you like to live is quite honestly the opposite of everything vegans stand for you literally just unboxed a bag made from dead animal skins the other day the majority of your makeup skin and hair care products arent cruelty free youre wasteful and harm the environment because of all the plastic cutlery and paper plates you use if you want to get in shape guess whatyou gotta work out you gotta eat veggies and healthy proteins you gotta cut back on the alcohol,2,NOT

eat only whole plant foods like brown rice potato and fruits for great health and maximum weight loss if you are scared about protein beans like lentils are your best friends with this you will have more nutrients than with almost all other diets animal protein or not and avoid vegan processed foods including bread they will make you fat no matter how vegan they are theyre totally fine once in a while but only if you ate properly for a long time and it will harm the whole plant food weight loss that you can get when coming off of a animal protein diet,1,NOT

watch hot for food and mommy tang its good meal inspiration im sure there is many more,1,NOT
always always be smart and ask questions when you go out to eat dont buy animal products just because the rest of ur friends are you have to keep motivated and with veganism your have to eat a larger volume of food to get more calories because plant foods are less calorie dense which is sometimes the reasons why you can get full easier since ur stomach is much more filled up than with a small piece of meat at the bottom of your stomach and also keep track of vitamin intake youre most likely going to lack in vitamin b so maybe purchase a supplement or fortified foods to help overcome that and also a lot of plant foods contain nonheme iron which is harder to absorb than heme ironin meats but to fix that you need to keep up your vitamin c levels  orange juice vitamin gummies in order to absorb it more efficiently and protein should be fine if you eat more lentils and quinoaespecially quinoa because it is a perfect proteinthats my advice for u good luck,1,NOT
broccoli holds more protein than steak so you could try that but not many loves broccoli beans are great im so excited for you to go vegan,1,NOT

not like she did a whole video on making eggs and bacon,2,NOT
alright i feel like this needs to be said i never comment on her videos but i see more hate here than on any other channel its annoying because most of you dont realize that  she likes the hate its attention  the hate she gets is perpetuating the on the kitchen floor videos and anything similar trish reads the comments and sees the views and then she does whatever it takes receive that same amount of attention  most of you think that shes just a stupid blonde but look at her she will soon be approaching  million subscribers and she gets tons of views she lives in la in an extremely nice house drives a g wagon and has designer everything despite what you think about her lifestyle the only thing most of you have to complain about her is her weight problem im not saying she is healthy by any means and she clearly has an eating disorder but shes at least aware of it she clearly has some psychological issues with attention disorders anxiety depression and she gets attached to things and people which indicated an addictive personality not to mention her past drug use she has issues so does everyone else however she works harder than most other youtubers i watch she posts consistently and has a hugely wide variety of content shes open on the internet and if you actually listen to some of the serious things she talks about shes more intelligent than you might initially think im not saying she makes the best choices and i dont agree with everything about this girl but i can appreciate someone who takes this much time toward something she works hard on her musicdancing which isnt my favorite but i still applaud her for keeping up with it anyway what have most of you done with your perfect lives,1,NOT
why i dont feel like this is true i feel like she is saying this just for a paycheck and wont actually do it,2,NOT

im so proud of you this is amazing trish ,1,NOT
glad you are making an effort to go vegan trish im cheering you on  dont pay attention to the people dragging you down even if you nake mistakes no one is perfect,1,NOT
baby steps i feel like youre doing it all in one go and you have a lifetime of habits to change in order to fully transition give yourself a chance i think that making good lifestyle choices like picking the right products to consume over food that is bad for your body is a great thing i wish your reasons were less superficial but then again we are guilty of that in my opinion changing your diet around like this should be more about what you enjoy eating that is good for your body and soul which doesnt always mean that you need to become vegan it is entirely possible to live a vegan lifestyle but the lack of nutrients that you get from animal products may affect you in the long run you should consider yourself lucky if it happens sooner than that so that you can try something else until you find something that works for you lastly the argument we were never supposed to eat animal product is bullocks honestly just look at the structure of your teeth front teeth are sharperedged to tear into meat easier the back teeth are from grinding your food until you are able to swallow which also aids your digestion herbivores aka vegans of the animal kingdom have flatdull teeth because flora and fauna do not require the shredding action of sharper teeth i hope this is helpful in any way and if i may ask please do not follow all of freelees dietary advice especially not because it works for her and shes super skinny now she has no training or education on this subject at all please consult a physician and a dietitian to figure out what foods you should eat and which you should avoid according to your body type and the current state of your health i highly recommend this last part you should always seek professional advice from certified practitioners tldr freelee is full of shit eat the health foods that you genuinely enjoy talk to an actual doctor and an actual dietitian,1,NOT
i think you should just watch what i ate in a day from vegan channels also get an audio book on veganism like skinny bitch its awesome and i think it would definitely speak to you,1,NOT

yeahh girl  good luck going vegan changed my life in so many ways if you remember me like  years ago i was a mess although i photoshopped my pictures lol in person i looked like i was falling apart i didnt realize i had a toxic effect from meat i just knew it always made me feel lethargic after eating it now i know i have a gene that gives me dna damage from smoked and cooked meat when certain chemicals are released i am also lactose intolerant but was drinking milk anyway and have bad reactions to simple carbs processed sugar and preservatives i was  lbs heavier i had sleep disorders paralasis and nocturnal panic attacks add mood swings cysts and a bunch of other issues i had no idea how sensitive i was till i started eating clean i lost  lbs and i felt better than i have ever felt in my life no brain fog so much focus energy and people were telling me at  that i looked younger and better than i did at  it literally changed my lifebeyond the little good karma vibes from knowing im doing a good thing for the environmentanimals  ,1,NOT

yes omg beans and rice and lentils are so versatile in cooking so many dips and falafels are surprisingly vegan going vegan also encourages a lot of home cooking like curries and other rice dishes dips and cool potatoes so try to make time for that too just remember that a lot of junk food may be vegan but that doesnt mean its healthy also for chocolate most dark chocolate should use soy instead of cow milk also drink loads of water just for the general toning of your body and keep dancing good luck trisha congratulations ,1,NOT

you shouldnt be worried about over eating you really need to make sure you get all the vitamins and nutrients that youd normally get in dairy and meats such as proteins and vitamin b i recommend getting some nutoatsoya milk with no added sugar and also non dairy butter to make the diet easier also make lots of lentilpulse soups which are really yummy and filling good luck,1,NOT

i did the same thing youre doing about proclaiming it out loud i was stuck in a pescetarian phase for almost a year really struggling to make the commitment to veganism so at work i told everyone i was vegan from that day on and so i was it definitely helps to put it out into the world i lost  pounds in the first four months of going vegan and even though it wasnt my goal to lose weight during this process it is a super bonus the first two weeks is a bit of a struggle but after that as long as you eat well and nourish your body itll be the best decision youve ever made the best advice i can give you is that if you mess up allow yourself to move on a lot of people feel like if they messed up once then its hopeless and they want to stop being vegan you just have to accept the fact that its an entirely new lifestyle you have to get used to and you will accidentally eat things that you wouldnt even think werent vegan just take each moment as a learning experience and enjoy your journey,1,NOT

wow this is great my tip would be to eat as much as you want within a meal avoid snacking between meals and dont be too fanatical about exactly what it is youre eating ie how healthy it is  as if you can find things you enjoy and also make you satiated the longer youre going to stick with it and actually become less obsessive about what youre missing out on also dont worry about what others think or say about your choices just know within yourself  and be happy within yourself that you are doing this for the right purposes ,1,NOT

i personally competed against terry miller and andraya yearwood and i have noproblem with the idea of them winning the races that they compete in if they identify as a girl then let them compete as one if most of the female student body is acceptant of these very talented girls than the parents shouldnt have a problem they are not the ones racing on that  lane track if anything terry and andraya push the rest of the girls to work harder in order to beat them in a race,1,NOT
this got me thinking about intersexed people have they been allowed to compete i mean if someone is born both sexes then they might have an unfair advantage or not depending where they get placed to compete mens or womens sports i believe what used to be done in this situation was to just throw them into womens sports i do remember some news stories about this and i have to say it is rather unfair its not only unfair to the women but to the intersexed as well it would seem a solution would be start another division for intersexed but with so few births being so who would fund it on top of that it wouldnt be fair for transgendered to be thrown in with the intersexed division because of whos taking what hormone could have an unfair advantage so would a fourth subset for transgender athletes be needed again who is going to fund it it gets kind of crazy the transgender thing is one issue but what about those who are intersexed this idea of sports competition seems more legit because intersexed people arent choosing to be another sex like how it is said about transgendered should sports be off limits to the intersexed and if so wouldnt that be unfair so technically this is the same problem different issue,2,NOT
it is truly fair to exclude them from competing in women sports people that say men can be changed into women are plan idiots they can take all the hormones they want in the end they are still male their natural default is male they were born male they should not compete as women it come be the only way for them to win its likely they were losing to makes so hey lets identify as male and compete with women this generation is full of depraved idiotic people,5,ABU

here is my thoughts on the matter like it matters wich it proberly dont the left have been far to fast on this one they ignored various of things men are faster stronger so we can defo argue its cheating but the root of the real issue is no women stopped it no one took a rational discussion on this those who tried failed so it derailed to be something perverse and stupid mostly stupid did a few doctors say well the this is wrong proberly did a few say its right sure was the cummonity agreeing on this yeah defo their own that is what about the other part fact of the matter its now they talk out and not when it could be stopped and tested in a prober manner this is just stupid and bad for eavryone involved and i do not get why no testing was done and such was done but the other side is equal at fault here they didnt speak up thats my opnion hoped you enjoyed,2,NOT

how is it even mildly controversial to say that biological males with an xy chromosome have a physical advantage over a biological female with a xx chromosome im all for tolerance of trans folks but this is beyond ridiculous,2,NOT
i disagree with this statement certain individuals taking advantage of the shallow system that is causing problems to very few other individuals can not be justified as a attack on women the whole thing is just just unbearably naive i dont care about anyones opinions or their feelings what i care about is the facts and numbers the fact is they should havent been gone through any type of process of which they can be deified as transgender so they should have not been allowed to perticipate at the first place we as a society are facing some very dramatic changes we should be more careful to what we accept and reject now otherwise our future will only hold darkness for next generation we should keep an open mind but approve only with solid facts,5,ABU

maybe the cisgendered women should boycott competing until transwomen get their own race then there wont be a competition to race in anyways for anyone until something changes cis gendered women need their own category period i also find it disgusting that people have reduced women to the level of estrogen or testosterone found in the body it takes much more than just hormone levels to create a woman after puberty everything from bone density to size and other important changes happen oh yeah remember the menstrual cycle that too women athletes often have to train so hard that they can even lose their periods which is unhealthy and transwomen who have not been through cisgendered female puberty say that if they just make sure the testosterone in their body is at a low enough level that they are biologically women and should compete with them this is madness hormone therapy is there to help someone feel like they are a woman it cannot actually turn you into one biologically it will not make you turn into the woman you would have been had you been through a female not male puberty i think trans people should be protected against violence but they are still not technically the women or men they feel that they are and do not need to be in the same category for sports why cant there be a transgender competition this is not like getting to use the ladies washroom that helps transwomen feel safer far away from potentially abusive cisgendered males this is about competing with cisgendered women scholarships are on the line here biology matters,2,NOT

unfair period its ok to identify as a women but at the end of the day they are physically boys i would not allow my daughter to compete with them period not because they are transgender simply because like you heard on the video doctors do not even know exactly how the hormones are affecting their bodies its sad that those girls who trained hard and work hard to get to that point and  they were cheated period we just live in world that allows people to make whatever decisions they want and they want to be treat the same as everyone else but in this cases they are not like most regular girl they have an unfair advantage i bet if it was a more physical sport that like wrestling or soccer everyone would feel differently cause people would be able to see the obvious difference and advantage and strength and some case size i mean i get it we want them to feel normal but did anyone think the girls are being robbed of a experience as well,2,NOT
lol straight up men this is so unfair wtf,2,NOT
those girls are ugly as fuuuuck,2,NOT
if a man takes anabolic steroids to alter his hormones its unfair in a competitive sport against other natural men so what about a transgender man who takes hormone therapy to compete against other natural men what about a transgender woman who takes hormone therapy to compete against other natural women,2,NOT
there are  genetic differences between men and women in this case boys and girls six thousand five hundred genetic differences that are not changed with hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery to allow these boys and they are boys to compete in a girls sport category is wrong why isnt there a coed team or a transgender team they should not compete on a girls team because they are not girls even if they identify as girlschoose to live their lives as girls etc dont misunderstand me every person deserves to live according to their own free will but that does not entitle you to compete on a female team when you are genetically male  genetic differences its called science bitches,1,NOT
they said they feel welcome by the staff and other people thats because if anyone hurts their feelings they would be called racist and homophobic they would be shamed on national tv this is why so many kids are so confused and cant deal with reality most of us see the reality here but obviously they cant quit lying to our kids i feel bad for the girls competing against these boys but i also feel bad for the transgender girls its our fault,2,NOT
it is unfair and many hormone therapy involves steroids depends on their preference and the doctor,1,NOT

i subscribed after the nd video i watched just to make sure it wasnt a one time deal in the late s i found myself with many gay friends and i would have considered myself a strong proponent for the gay community and for transgender people i served in the military for  years and i have met many gay sailors this was before dont ask dont tell i didnt agree with a lot of the rules etc i really dont think that a persons sexual preference is anyones business and the gays that i knew  everyone knew and no one cared they were professional and were every bit a sailor some better than i was  a hetero fem one of my best friends was drag at night like i said no one cared in the s i used to get really pissed off at women in bars who would dance and make out with each other in bars to pick up men of course this was my opinion but lesbian and gays have fought the good fight for equality and here are women playing lesbian just for a one nighter i never asked a lesbian how they felt about that but for me i felt like it was a slap in the face of lesbians who have been locked in the closet but now its cool to act lesbian to me it was making a mockery of the being lesbian like playing lesbian as a convenience to get what you want is ok to me it wasnt i may not be entitled to an opinion as i have not lived as lesbian or trans skip to the bathroom situation i am not sure about how schools handle it so i cant comment i fully supported same sex union i felt it was bad judgement for the lgbtq community to force the world marriage on mainstream i more than likely did not fully understand why they needed to use the term marriage in my opinion had the lgbtq community asked for something that should be legal for everyone to engage in a civil union for legal reasons like insurance custody etc thing would be better for the lgbtq community today then the focus on transgenders and public bathrooms i think this whole mess really put the transgenders back to square one now society has the opinion that transgender  some of the crazies ive seen in your videos like i told my friends back when obama was threatening roy cooper and the crap that went down in north carolina transgenders have been around for many many years and they have been using the wrong bathrooms and no one knew i honestly dont thank any truly trans woman has a beard or any facial hair from what i know about a trans male to female that facial hair would feel like acid on there face it just wouldnt be there miss white i had no clue you were trans just another beautiful girl i know there are some trans folks who have not had access to some of the medical treatments you may have had access to but if there are males transitioning to female there are many no medical things a person can do to alter your appearance i used to have a very short hair cut and im not for everyday very feminine so i have been mistaken as lesbian a few times i know this is a rant but i guess im writing because maybe someone will read this and understand that most main stream people dont hold hatred against lesbian gays and transgenders but the problem is that this has become twisted and perverted and this has became forced on the country and from experience i dont and i dont think anyone else wants to be forced to accept some of the things the lgbtq community is pushing anyway love your show and i wish you all the best and i appreciate that you have your show to educate folks like me and folks not like me,2,NOT
i agree with you im a born female and i dont wear makeup or do my hair every day im literally sitting here in sweatpants a tshirt i bought from the mens section and ugg boots with my hair yanked up in a ponytail and no makeup so according to miss trisha over here i must be trans and a drag queen other people have told me i must be gender fluid or something because i like certain things and act certain ways so i must want to be a man which isnt true there is more to it than just how i dress myself or how i act,2,NOT
would love to hear your thoughts on crossdressers,1,NOT
she made two more vids about this shit you should check them out blaire  love you,1,NOT
yes i was waiting for this response,1,NOT
she needs a psychiatrist,2,NOT
ive been watching trish for like a longass time im just really really concerned about her mental health like i was already concerned and now im doubly concerned to me thats all thats really going on here someone needs to intervene and get her some serious help and she needs to stop hanging around enabling people who just go along with whatever she says or does realass people tell you when you need to shut up and tell you when youre full of shit nicely but firmly i dont think she has that person and shes left with her mind and for someone whos really mentally ill and untreated being left with your mind is a terrible terrible scenario i really hope she gets help and that big youtubers dont condone this by automatically agreeing with her statements to get some kind of clout for being a transally or whatever honesty people,1,NOT

do i think im transgender  percent do i still identify as my born gender me this is like me saying i identify as a squash but is a taster tot,5,ABU
so if transgenderism has nothing at all to do with sexstereotypes aka gender which is literally centred around the concepts of man  masculine and woman  feminine then why cant trish be a trans man who enjoys the sexstereotype of femininity why should she cut her hair males can have long hair right why should any trans people do anything at all to their appearance in order to align with the sexstereotype of the sex they identify as make it make sense,2,NOT
lack of education and ignorance led to her making that video also attention seeking trolling and just general fuckery,2,NOT
you are amazing i loooove you ,1,NOT
she also said she was a meth addict not long ago for those who say that when a person tells you what they really are you have to believe them and no hunty if jonathan yaniv came and told me hes trans i wouldnt believe and never will that only keeps paving the way for creeps and pedophiles trisha should be aware of this issue and not troll with certain things shit is tough as it is today and theres no need to add layers to it,2,NOT
 female or male trans or not trans we all have a balance of masculine and feminine energy shes clearly confused about that has she never heard someone tell a straight cis man to embrace his feminine side,1,NOT

masculine woman checking in i have had people insist that i should be trans ftm because i like traditionally masculine hobbies like building houses fixing cars hunting etc i dont act girly so for some reason that must mean im trans im not perfectly content with being a woman and it really bothers me when people latch onto things like trans gay etc just to get that boost of popularity that comes with it even had someone insist re demand i not engender my child while i was pregnant with my son i digress people need to stop latching onto buzzwords for their five seconds of fame because it really harms the people who are legitimately trans or gay or whatever they are falsely claiming just my two cents,1,NOT
bruh i get crushes on straight girls all the time and thats okay what isnt okay is trying to force myself upon them or intentionally making them question their sexuality and confusing them orliterally transitioning to a male so i can get straight girl coochie i dont do any of that by the way because i know about boundaries and accepting when someone isnt interested,1,NOT
you cant tell someone who or what they are but great job getting attention using her name just because you upload awful and boring content doesnt mean you have to profit off of others names,2,NOT

how does the wind affect muscles do i not understand physics or fitness im very lost,1,NOT
it is always entertaining the mental gymnastics the trans youtubers present males impersonate females and want to date males  the shortcut is they are actually gay females impersonate males and want to date females  the shortcut is they are actually lesbians the idea that children are born with an innate gender identity which develops prenatally and is impervious to environmental influence is not supported by any credible science body and brain are interconnected scientists have found no separate innate gender area of the brain which is fixed at birth childrens brains are very plastic they develop through interaction with people and the environment and they are constantly absorbing information and influences which shape them,2,NOT

ive been waiting for this video the second i saw trishas video im like hun that doesnt make you trans i hope blaire does a response video rofl,1,NOT
i dont like going into this but ive wanted to commit suicide over my gender dysphoria and her video genuinely disgusted me it was funny but when you go in depth on how that hurts people figuring it out its baaaad but queen blaire is  right she is a troll lol,2,NOT

i think you should perhaps rethink what her message was i dont think comparing it to being transgender or your transgender experience is entirely accurate just because i dont think she knows exactly what the term is but regardless she is struggling has hinted towards it for years and it does a lot more harm than good by invalidating someone elses difficulties just because it doesnt seem to make sense she used the wrong terms and comparisons yes no doubt thats more than likely due to ignorance but beyond that she clearly is really hurting and if shes felt this inside since being littlewell its no ones place to take that from her,1,NOT
hi kitty yeahhh what is trisha talking about transsexual what trisha just stopno more nonsense thanks,2,NOT
i literally threw up when i saw that shes a sexy woman and  a woman lol,2,NOT
ive watched trisha since  and i do not think shes trolling because she has said these same things before she made a video in  called gays i wanna bang and she says it sucks to be in a womans body but do i think shes trans noi think shes uncomfortable by societal standardsnot by her own body sis wants to be mom and have children for goodness sake,1,NOT

trish is always do something for attention love you blaire ,1,NOT
as a trans woman i find this hilarious knowing what trishas about i feel bad for the people struggling with identity crisis that are hurt by trishas trolling tho,1,NOT
i think trisha needs a break from social media and yt to find herself and establish genuine love for herself if she puts absolutely no effort into transitioning shes not trans as many transfemme or transmasculine do they just get to dress up and play the part without actually putting in the effort sono gigi you dont have to believe her until she starts showing signs of transition which she probably wont if she just said shes okay with her biological birth you can be a more masculine woman that makes you a tomboy not a man you can be a feminine guy youre probably gaybut youre not a woman,1,NOT
trasha is trash cut n dry ,2,NOT

if trisha does one of her dramatic cryingonthekitchenfloor responses to this i will be so amused,1,NOT
so heres what im thinking atm i dont think shes transgender at all but i do think this is coming from a place of her not having a total grasp on who she truly is not that i can say that i do either theres something psychologically not right with her i believe i think her career and poor decisionsdrug use has probably made it worse or shes trolling but im kind of starting to think her issues run deeper than previous thought,2,NOT
yeah you cant really blame her the lgbtqaip community really messed up the concept of transexual people also i identify as a gay man because i love britney spears,2,NOT

call a free lgbtq partyline number  at     or     or    ,1,NOT
trisha has been known for trolling yes but she also has been known for emotional unstability and numerous identity crisis i think she has always wanted desperately to feel like she belongs and that explains why she tries to insert herself in the lgbt community in absurd ways do i think shes trans hell no do i think she is legitimately struggling and needs to put some sort of label to it yes i think she believes shes trans and i think she believes that because she needs a concrete answer to a lifelasting issue,2,NOT
she says like like a lot like erm ma gawd like wat like ,1,NOT

i cant believe you would just flash ur pussy like that at the end of the video shameful d,2,NOT
love the owners of chik fil a spent millions of dollars fighting against marriage equality please dont support them by buying and eating their food but more than that the free advertising you just gave them by putting it on your channel they are not supportive of lgbtq rights worse they see you as a less than worthy american citizen and want to legislature that into law,1,NOT
this is a whole other topic yes fuck trish but how are you going to come and defend the lgbtq community especially the trans community while still supporting chickfila lol thats one of the restaurants that puts more money on antilgbtq campaigns lol they hypocrisy,1,NOT
i rarely do my hair or makeup i guess im transgender now  oh waiti guess i should use this one now  ,2,NOT
as a malesbian i find offense offensive,2,NOT

braire so not covering your zits makes you a man me a trans guy ceeeeelebrate good times c o m e o n,2,NOT
special snowflake syndrome always want to be something different just to feel special and unique,1,NOT
you really think you know everything let her be she feels how she feels let it be it not affecting anyone ngl you are rude and mean and need to know some life skills and not just ti turn to scoial media and use your platform to drag her through the mud if it bothers you so much talk to her thats what people that are not famous dolearn from them now i know why you are in so many tea pages,2,NOT
imagine someone making up a gender bashing someone else for trying to make up another gender  like at this point the transgender community wants people to accept them but dont want to accept anyone else,2,NOT
i dont wear makeup sometimes and i leave my zits alone im also assertive and powerfulso im a man,2,NOT
serious question if gender is a social construct then cant she say she is transgender wouldnt we have to believer her because gender can be anything if she were to say she is transsexual then i understand that she is crazy and trolling my understanding is that transgender is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and maybe dresses or acts as such but transsexual is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and takes steps to medically transition just trying to learn thanks  edit so is transgender even a thing then if you are just changing behaviorclothingstylepersonality that doesnt have to be a change from one gender to another if it were a change from one gender to another doesnt that just prove that masculinity and femininity are linked to sex idk this entire community is confusing to me i appreciate all insight,1,NOT
ugh i just just stop,2,NOT
nothing gives you a human the right to tell trisha another human what she is or isnt you are not her girl byyeeee,2,NOT
idk why anyone is worrying about what this trisha girl says she literally thought dogs didnt have brains  shes not worth the effort shes just stupid as fuck she doesnt know what transgender even means you guys should be nice to her she obviously has brain damage,5,ABU

sooooo im sorry if this comes off as harsh or offensive to trisha but how many unattractive girlswomen say they are only attracted to gay guys hundreds of thousands millions billions honey its a very old ploy no different than the ugly middle school boy who has a girlfriend who lives in insert foreign country here or the  year old male virgin who is only attracted to super models and he wont settle for anything less its all bullshit its a coping mechanism or a defensive posture taken by people who dont just want to come out and say why wont anyone fuck me and thats fine i guess but just admit that to pull this i think im trans bullshit is offensive and harmful get over yourself dear,3,NOT
i cant like this video enough,1,NOT

i totally agree with you love your content,1,NOT
fuck trolling trashy trisha i was a long time subscriber of hers and chose to look away when shed past controversial troll videos over the years sometimes i even found humor in them however when she faked opiate withdrawal i pulled the plug on financing her hoarding lifestyle as someone who has struggled with opiate dependency due to chronic and deteriorating issues within my spine that was negatively impacted by this hocus pocus bullshit narrative spun by the government across media increasingly so over the past six to seven years in addition to losing several friends and family member because of overdoses because they were strong armed into illegally sourcing opiates which ended up being this imported chinese super fentanyl fancily made to appear like their normal medication that had previously helped them have any sort of quality of life but was ripped away from them because of a god damn government experiment ps earlier this year the opiate epidemic was found by the ciaag to be a government experiment much like the s crack issue if anyone would like i can provide a link to their findings which have sources linked to gov web addresses,2,NOT
just bc trisha is masculine with her assertiveness doesnt mean shes a man women shouldnt think that bc they do something considered manly means that they are a guy vice versa no guys should think they are a woman bc of something feminine these stereotypes were put into place just recently in the grand scheme bc guys used to wear dresses its just fashion and surface stuff i had a bestfriend who was trans and believe me i know the confusion of a trans in the first years of transitioning and for her to make a mockery out of it bc she thinks gay guys are hot lol i find a ton of gay guys hot am i trans no,1,NOT
i wear makeup about once a month lol,1,NOT
youre so right its a fad and it really is ruining it for people who are genuinely trans and so on,2,NOT

too many bullies commenting she isnt trans but she obviously doesnt know what being transgender is she just sounds confused either that or shes a troll just trying to get famous using controversy but that would require a level of processing she really doesnt display here so its kind of hard to say hard to wrap my head around someone her age being this oblivious about gender and gender identity,1,NOT
tricia is the biggest troll on youtube i wouldnt take her seriously ever,2,NOT
i see that chikfila cup ,1,NOT
i feel like you are the most sensible trans and i love your view on things  non binary is such a joke ,1,NOT

the lgbt community completely baffles me for years people have actually taken their lives and spent their lives representing the community so they can be accepted and not judged treated the same way which im all for but then when the community finally gets somewhere they turn around well i say they i shouldnt group everyone together i mean a few certain others like blaire they turn around and say no  you cant be that your this your not allowed because thats what everyone else is like yall baffle me if you want to be accepted you probably shouldnt be turning around telling others what they are and arent allowed to be  get your sht straight no pun intended,2,NOT
im a cis woman and i think trisha is being ridiculous she says shes a trans man and then in the next video shes sitting there in her bra wtf,2,NOT
any commentary on tess holliday coming out as queer shes the fat lady that wants recognition for the fat acceptance movement and attention from the fashion industry i believe shes using the lgbtq community because we literally accept anyone unfortunately,2,NOT
where do you find these nut balls holy sht,2,NOT
cant tell if trolling or dumb,2,NOT
remember when she came out as gay as well lol,2,NOT
i feel with all of the backlash its going to make people anxious about coming out and figuring out who they are i dont agree with everything trish said i think she has alot of soul searching to do but i also do not agree with all of the hate she is getting and i do not believe that it is our place to tell someone who they are or arent,1,NOT
nice to see you delete perfectly normal  respectful suggestions  disappointed,2,NOT
she goes through phases of obsessions and this is one of them but hey the bitch is making money with all the views she gets on her madness hahahah,2,NOT

at least gigi is consistent the far left says that if you identify as something that is what you are no questions asked if you are a  year old man and you identify as a  year old girl you must be treated and accepted as a  year old girl i also understand and agree with you blair you dont accept that premise that identifying as something makes you that thing so youre not going to go along with what trisha says unless shes willing to walk the walk its the people who say that youre a bigot if you dont accept the  year old man as a  year old girl but who are also criticizing trisha those are the people i have a problem with theyre being hypocritical,1,NOT
i now am transitioning from a cis gender white male to a cis gender white male and if you say im not a cis gender white male or address me by my preferred pronouns of dudebrobronation or brosaurus rex then youre a bigot,2,NOT

what if the left concedes the data presented here but argues that womens choices arent really free  that societal conditioning by the patriarchy is to blame,1,NOT
shes so hd,1,NOT
wage gender gap was created by the far right,1,NOT
watched this video much too late as in  weeks too late i saw london and kalvins vids though so i already knew this was a thing that happened i just realized something after watching this vid compared to my first impressions after watching london and kalvins vids causing me to laugh at how ridiculous she sounded she looks like shes on meth given that high meth use can lead to various delusions and even an increased sexual desire i think her crazy thought process could very well have something to do with the fact that shes on drugs i hope im wrong if i am theres either something else wrong with her to show that she needs professional help or shes an expert troll playing all of us,2,NOT
when i even heard about it i was like why are we giving her the time and attention for this shes a troll and its kinda messed up for her to do that but she just wants attention and nothing more,2,NOT
off topic but blaires lips are looking fire i swear she went over the top with lip injections before but now they look so natural and plump,1,NOT
the first thing i thought when i saw trishas video was i hope blair makes a video on this youre always on it sis,1,NOT
wow im attracted to straight men wow i am now a straight woman,2,NOT
i totally agree with you masculinity abd femininity are social constructs in the sense thar men have to be masculine and women have to be feminine trisha hasnt once stated that she has had these feeling before had dressed up twice as a boy has not passed either times btw and has never displayed dysphoric tendencies even watchinf the video clips im looking at her and spotting her god damn nails she has put money into her body to portray herself as female time and time agian and its irritating that she has no idea what shes talking about i truely feel sorry for her,2,NOT
if you still believe trisha even after this video u might want to go watch her interview with tmz,2,NOT

women are more likely than men to accept a lower salary im guessing id like to see a study done on the differences if any in willingness and ability to negotiate for a higher salary as well as employers willingness to accept or decline requests for a raise based on gender,1,NOT
theres quite a bit to unpack here sure companies can hire only women and make their discrimination more blatantly obvious but i think taping a please sue me sign on their door wouldve been cheaper  maybe the wage gap is lower fair doesnt mean it doesnt exist  even with the same education credentials men still get paid more than women for the same job even aauw one of the sources she uses in the video said so also the point about men and womens common major choices is irrelavent because as confirmed yourself in the beginning of the video the issue is getting paid less for the same job  her final point men are more likely to work more hours doesnt debunk women getting paid less for the same work for the same hours now does it thanks for pretending youre going to address the issue for what it is and then dancing around it,1,NOT
you realize this is a commercial right right,1,NOT
if i pay to keep your videos free theyre not free to me,1,NOT

i disagree with the points made in this videoi dont have any argument against it but i disagree and therefore im right,1,NOT
im sure someone will try to discredit this video likely a feminist who will have no actual proof that it isnt true but most feminists dont care about trivial things like facts,2,NOT
was this expository or persuasive im doing a paper on this video and i need a persuasive source,1,NOT
saying there is no wage gap is still a jump from saying it isnt calculated properly,1,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense my new favorie quote,2,NOT
i have never taken into consideration the gender wage gap that seems to exist today so when the discussion came out during of our classes i was most definitely caught off track and honestly bothered in the youtube video there is no wage gap it gave us a bit of sense of why men are paid more due to education occupation position and hours women are paid  in comparison to every  that a man makes women are seen to have to juggle being moms with responsibilities inside and outside of work basically women are viewed as weak the video made it seem that women arent as capable as men when it comes to working long hours especially at a last minute timing women however are not weak i know that they do take more responsibilities than men when it comes to their children but just because women are capable of taking on more roles doesnt mean they should have to face a wage gap when it comes to education i strongly believe everyone should be paid equally yes people get paid more for their seniority at a job but that is due to them having worked their way up there either by being their for such a long time or simply because they do their job right and get promoted in the end everyone should start off by getting paid the same in any career they have the youtube video and the reading we had assigned for homework sheth and gould  includes a graph and tries to use that the excuse for this wage gap is due to women choosing low paid college majors leading to low paid jobs in a sense i see how it is true women go for ore of the motherly careers and i think thats how we women are seemed to be this gender wage gap does exist and some of its reasons provided in the video seem reasonable in the end however the wage gap shouldnt exist no matter the circumstance,1,NOT
i really think cristina hoffsummers is awsome,1,NOT
it feels so good to hear a woman saying this thank you for being reasonable intelligent and openminded real openmindedness not blatant hypocrisy,1,NOT
female porn star earn more,1,NOT
lol i just had to laugh at the man who works longer hours but ends up sleeping at the desk ohhhh man,1,NOT

one of the only ads on this website that i didnt skip,1,NOT
thank you i m french viewer usa took the foul french theory at the frenchs in s fermented this during sixty years and vomit back this theory all around the world now feminist propaganda invads my country and this fake about wage gap is in every news merci pour votre debunkage,1,NOT
thank the lord you understand that wage gap doenst exist,1,NOT
all i got from this is that the professions men prefer are compensated better sounds sexist to me,2,NOT
where are the statistics for the men are more willing to work longer hours claim,1,NOT
omfg the first sentence is the logic i always use i would rather hire all females if i can pay them lower,2,NOT
there is a massive difference between choice and society norms this doesnt address underlying meanings of wage gaps,1,NOT
department of labor releases report refuting wage gap obama for the next  years ignores report keeps preaching about the gender wage gap,1,NOT
go ahead and read a script you puppet,2,NOT
reason for wage gap is also that men have on average a higher iq than women you can see this by looking at chesssnooker ratings all of the top players are men,2,NOT
k people are in denial and cant accept logic,2,NOT
the president of the united states makes more money than me  thats not fair boohoohoo  i want to get paid as much as the president,2,NOT
i must say that this video which tries to explain the differences is really quite ignorant yes the differences can be explained by choices but it is not like as a woman you are by nature more likely to go for less paying jobs it is that they are held back by structures in society men are not better rocket scientists and women arent better suited for being nurses these patterns can be explained it is what the genders stereotypically do that decides google engineer or doctor and then google nurse or kindergarten teacher overrepresentation in better and lower paying jobs has directly to do with the societies view and for these people to flat pit ignore that makes me pissed ,2,NOT
so yesterday i was discussing this subject with my girlfriend and i explained all of this but even though she agreed she came up with an argument i found difficult to refute even if you consider same jobs same position working hours and total time working at a company companies ran by elder males tend to favor career ascension to men instead of women therefore making them earn more mainly because they still live in the past and as a man i have to say ive heard about these cases maybe they dont provide an overall big gender gap but they are a reality thoughts on this,1,NOT
its funny how when you search wage gap in youtube this video isnt at the top despite having the most viewer traffic,1,NOT
today i was having a debate with my teacher and some classmates during english and my teacher and a friend kept going on about the wage gap didnt listen to facts i was this close to walking out,1,NOT
if the wage gap was true why are so many men wanting to be transgender women maam,1,NOT
inhales deeply thank you,1,NOT
wait thats the woman who took on trigglypuff awesome,1,NOT
ive worked in industry for  years aerospace logistics and it and the only sex based bias i have found involved moving what few women there were into managerial positions i think this is because the few women they had to choose from when hiring were pretty incompetent and really most of them were worse than useless at the technical side of things they had no choice but to move them into management,1,NOT
so its settled women get shitty degrees work shitty hours but expect a bigger pay check than men lmao tf,2,NOT
great video thank you for it the gender pay gap is myth and a invention of the feminists greetings from germany superextreme,1,NOT
you lost most of the population when you said its just common sense the masses lose all common sense and reasoning ability and go for virtue signaling and heard mentality thats why you see all these sjws and feminazis shouting this shit down peoples throats,5,ABU
women also dont negotiate salary like men do upon starting a position and when they do they usually request more benefits and perks than demanding higher dollar compensation this probably explains the narrow gap that still remains as cited in the video,1,NOT
i graduated geomatic engineering with honors and have spent a decade in my industry up to several months ago i worked for a firm where two young men were employed one with a years experience the other with two years experience one failed his program the other nearly failed his program one made more than me and one earned the same as me i had substantially more responsibilities than either of them i have dealt with this almost my entire career and have even been told by companies that they do not hire females for my position i dont know what kind of nonsense youre reading but maybe you should talk to women who work in an engineering field and hear their firsthand experiences about an overwhelming wage gap and predominant sexism in the industry,1,NOT
gotta encourage young women to go into science and professional careers as much as men then hopefully there will be no gap barring the occasional sexist recruiter who thankfully have mostly died out i read about a study a while ago that found that women are more likely than men to not apply for a job if they dont meet all the criteria things like that are what needs to change,1,NOT
i would like to call myself a feminist its not to say i want equal pay for all i want equal value of life for all the wage gap is as explained in the video reliant on so many variables i have most knowledge in norwegian studies about this where we have  of mens pay mostly because of not willing to work longgraveyard shifts pregnancies prioritising family over ovetime the difference in pay if you work for the private or official sector and people under  tend to earn less than their peers no matter the gender there is still a big gap though taking the electricians in norway as an example with the same age education employer and work hours there is still a gap of kr usd per month studies by official statistical bureau of norway i am waiting for them to find the reasons for that,1,NOT

prageru is not a university it is a media organisation im not being hyperbolic it literally isnt a tertiary education institution and notice how the presenter didnt actually name any of the studies cited the first was referred to as a study by the american association of university women and the second was a nameless paper by the us department of labor a reluctance to name or link to studies in the description usually points towards cherrypicking information that suits your argument i dont know very much about gender pay disparity but im going to look for a more reliable source to help me figure it out,1,NOT

wow such a great like to dislike ratio the comments are enabled and the video is narrated by a woman what more could you ask for,1,NOT
well due the social network justice the woman have to be payed and the man no,1,NOT
moving just a little off topic the worst paying jobs you mentioned should be higher paying they are incredibly important jobs especially teaching and we should be trying to make pay fair for all of them its not a sexist issue but it would mean women will start to earn a bit more,1,NOT
dont forget that in america there is no paid maternity leave and that will prove all feminists wrong,1,NOT
if u subscribe to prager u your an insecure ignorant sheep think for yourself,1,NOT

some of the videos prageru publish are misleading and i always wonder why im still subscribe to these guys these videos and many others are the reason why good job prageru and keep up the goodwork,1,NOT
i dont get why feminists and sjws think that they females get paid less because theyre females its because some people do better work then you do and are more efficient at it a wage gap is if you are as efficient as someone else and produce the exact same amount of work but you get paid less which is illegal therefor meaning no wage gap,1,NOT
shes so cute ,1,NOT
feminists can all step on lego,1,NOT
thanks for posting the truth i know its not politically correct to expose these type of cnn liars who want to spread propaganda for their own divide and conquer political gain,1,NOT
i thought wage gap implies unequal pay for equal work this study seems to factor unequal working hours unequal choices etc how silly studies should be made on how there is wage gap for equally qualified equally hardworking equally risktaking equally available individuals of different genders,1,NOT
 youre full of shit women make more than men and get to do less doing it,2,NOT
maybe the jobs this woman has been paid for has been equal but i have had jobs that i was paid less for than the male coworkers i got paid as much as hr than men i worked with even though they came to the job a year after me,1,NOT
im not conservative and dont agree with most of pragerus ideas but there are some pretty good points they make in here,1,NOT
wish i was either gay or blackand i could at least have equality and wouldnt get my a pinched ouch,2,NOT
damn i just found this prageru youtube channel they are incredible at addressing very controversial and prevalent topics with clear and authoritative evidence i am so proud of prageru good for them for taking on these important issues from a evidence based viewpoint,1,NOT
i went to work for a ship yard in ms my mother got me on board on that job because she had pull being shes been there for almost  years i went in as an apprentice starting at  an hour my mother was making  an hour for the same exact job as a non apprentice do the math if youd like but all the men at my job made more than all the female,1,NOT
i understand that a lot of the gap can be ascribed to choices made by both men and women but i think it is important to consider societal attitudes which discourage women from aspiring to careers in highpaying jobs and especially stem fields and push them toward softer more traditionally feminine career paths,1,NOT
although im a total left winger i enjoy listening to prageru because at least they say it in an intelligent way and it forces me to develop a smarter rebuttal if i cant then i tend to agree with it the problem with people now days is that people only listen to what they want to hear and become very polarized i recommend watching vox videos if you are willing to do the same as me im sure right wing media makes the left wing sound stupid and vise versa but you look at educated thoughts on both sides neither sound as stupid,1,NOT
get rekt libtards,5,ABU
a university i wouldnt mind sending my children to,1,NOT
i need help to destroy feminism so in the same worked time and same type of job why theres still a little little tiny gendergap i said because of bonuses like distance between home and work danger in work etc maybe those bonuses there not exist in your contry but in spain they do my feminists friends says that is because woman cannot ascendrise up in work as easily as man do of course there are statistics that prove that im not wrong but i have not arguments to prove that woman can ascend btw someone correct me if i had mistakes on the previous text wanna learn english xd thank you so much,1,NOT
all students should be shown this in schools especially in colleges,1,NOT
so whats the spewing about women and men do not get paid the same for same job same work same experience i dont see any backing evidence or examples of this when they start saying this stuff but obviously theyre making people think or believe it whoever they are,1,NOT
i lived in a communist country and i can confirmed we never heard of gap gender wage before whats going on us ,1,NOT
so men are just smarter than women,1,NOT
you cant work fewer hours more predictable schedules less dangerous jobs pursue lower paying careers sacrifice more time for children or other aesthetic reasons etc and still expect to be paid the same as a man who sacrifices family spends more time at work pursues more dangerous higher paying jobs is able to focus long stretches of time at career and spends less time with family remember women have higher rates of depression and suicide in similar careers as men that proves theyre biologically less likely to pursue higher paying careers,1,NOT
offtopic it makes me sad that all the most important jobs like social work and psychology and humanitarian stuff dont pay anything,1,NOT
this is just satisfying,1,NOT
so youre telling me that women receiva less money because they dont make the correct choices really ,1,NOT
and they teach the pay gap myth in school and pretend its real,1,NOT

if only google could see this youre right there is no gender gap in pay,1,NOT
how to debunk the wage gap  fail to debunk the fact that an actual gap exists  imply that the smaller gap is no big deal  give explanations for why the gap still exists that were already controlled for in studies   therefore the wage gap doesnt exist brilliant,1,NOT
its not sexisim its common sense well common sense is sexisim for femmenist and leftist what do you guys expect xd,2,NOT
so your last argument after taking in variables it will vanish to almost nothing is that without any study or verification you are just implying that it will vanish that is blatant hypocrisy you know first you manipulate data and say women just take lower paying job by enforcing sexist values throughout families and then you just assume what the hell is that you yourself said that it shrinks down to  to  peecent why not a zero percent you just assume that small wage gap is not important lets do a fun maths game if every american male earns  dollar for hour and a woman is paid  percent less taking your generous average then she is just paid  dollars now that  dollars might not seems much but then it gives a decent fast food meal to fill your stomach once and that is important to many lower classes now if you multiply the hours worked by both the genders by  hours approx a five day  to  work week it compounds to  dollars and then if you multiply it to  week month that is  hoursthen the wage compounds to  dollars now that is a lot okay that is enough to make you survive comfortably in a middle class home for at least a week now it seems you are bad at maths not just the corporations and yeah i might have forgotten to take some data points into account,1,NOT
 good facts,1,NOT
women are successful in school men are successful at life,2,NOT

i was hired to a position previously occupied by a male about my same age when i was cleaning out the filing cabinets i came across a pay stub he had left was i surprised and angry to see his salary was k more than i was offered and i was more qualified to boot i had no children so that wasnt an issue and was known for working long hours often long after everyone else in the office had gone home it was blatant taking advantage i left after  months when i realized there would be no moving past the glass ceiling or changing the male dominated management mentality men need to realize that women can do work as well or better than a man and get over their baseless fears of possibly inadequacy,1,NOT
i love how a women is saying this stuff finally a feminist cant use the its just because hes a straight white man excuse,1,NOT
my english teacher tried to tell me i was sexist for explaining why it doesnt exist,1,NOT

leftists lack any common sense,2,NOT
our factors for wage gap in full time work is how many hours worked and occupation choices isnt full time work defined by  hours in most cases and its not peculiar that mens occupations offer more pay i guess all those lawsuits between women and companies over the women getting paid less were just leftist jokes lol hilarious,1,NOT
i love you based mom,1,NOT

the beginning of this video is already wrong the wage gap compares wages within the same job inform yourself,1,NOT
originally  extreme feminists disliked the video without watching it unfortunately the number has increased to over  and is bound to keep increasing,1,NOT
but doesnt this presuppose that income should be the main determinant for choosing a profession it should be a factor but combined with aptitude interest benefit to society etc to ensure people are contributing to society to the best of their individual ability if the data given here is correct the question still isnt why do women choose lower paying jobs or why do women value more things over their job the question is who does our society undervalue femaledominant services compared to maledominant ones and why does the unpaid work of socially important things like child rearing communitybuilding taking care of elders etc fall disproportionately on the shoulders of women,1,NOT
the salary gap is affected by the choices of individuals so we must ask ourselfs what is driving each sex towards specific career paths im not satisfied with the simple awnser that the gender gap just cant be explain and that it simply is there are various factors that can be properly studied social standarscultural customs  companies and countries policies  so maybe in order to explain what drieves people to make certain decitions we have to look at theyre surroundings and see if there is were the problem lies,1,NOT
feminists dont care about facts if you want to make them listen you need to say i feel every other sentence and conclude by finding some way to blame men no matter what,1,NOT
where are the feminists now,1,NOT
i found this video very interesting i know that in class we discussed how the wage gap is  cents to every dollar according to the statistics in the article written by equal means equal however that didnt necessarily specify how these came about for example chrisitna hoff sommers breaks it down in her video there is no wage gap she says that this is just based off the median income of women and men i liked that they used median because this gives an accurate representation of the situation using an average would just mess this certain statistic up however she did bring up a statistic from an organization that is feminist that says the wage gap is only about  cents when all factors are included these factors include things such as what job they have and how many hours they work i liked how she pointed this out and set the record straight on this statistic however after reading the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real by elise gould jessica schieder and kathleen geier the wage gap is looked into further the article has numerous statistics but figure k really stand out to me people always argue that there is a wage gap because of the education level between men and women however this chart showed that even at the same education level men make more than women on average this statistic is very useful because now men and women are in the same level and men still make more than women overall all these sources are helpful i think that there is no doubt a wage gap because there is just so much more evidence to prove there is a wage gap then to prove there isnt one i did find the video interesting because she does have solid claims to back up her point,1,NOT
the equal pay act of  is federal law prohibiting wage disparity based on gender if you are being paid less than a man for the same job get a lawyer and sue,1,NOT
mierda lleva solo  segundos el video y ya me dejo flipando con la preguntavvv,1,NOT

feminist counter argument women dont get into those positions because the patriarchy women cant do anything for themselves a reason why feminism hurts women more,1,NOT
yay finally the truth i get tired of hearing that wage gap myth women dont have much more to fight for anymore and we should be grateful for that,1,NOT
let them do it tbh let them go and correct this injustice let them go to every single woman and every single man in the same position compare their earnings and correct the differences based on gender you know what will happen nothing the exact same thing thats happened to it despite all the equality laws that have been put in place over the past sixty years you know why nothing has happened because in order to solve a problem the problem has to actually be there to solve if its not then youre not doing anything are you,1,NOT
people dont want to work but expect to be paid ahh good old socialism,1,NOT
if you believe in this wage gap come work at my companyim here getting paid per job and used to stay till pm you can be a unicorn for all i careyou get paid by completing and turning in the job,1,NOT
im liberal and shit and ik the wage gap is real and if it was it is not possible able to he proven however i do believe that some companies might pay some women lower but thats just few companies,1,NOT
i went to a seminar on wage negotiation it was mostly geared towards women and i was one of the only two men that showed up they explained that another big issue is that most women dont negotiate their wages where most men will that a lot of women either dont know they can negotiate their pay or dont think their in a position too they did say that some companies have tried to take advantage of that by typically offering a woman less than they would a man on the hopes she wont negotiate it,1,NOT
i think some of the gap can be down to how well men  women negotiate i have a totally awesome  strong female friend who recently negotiated salary for a new position and she just couldnt push hard on the salary the employer played it down in the range and my friend took the middle ground her skills are awesome and shes an absolute dream asset in her field but she just wouldnt push for the top end money i think guys are more likely to do that,1,NOT
thank you mrs sommers ,1,NOT
did anyone consider the causality is the other way around jobs with more women get paid less just because the majority are women that would be sexist and when you honestly consider it you realize its true,1,NOT

yeah the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank is objective lol,2,NOT
this video proved to me that there is a gender wage gap in the example of the georgetown university  top paying majors and  least paying majors the  out of the  top paying majors dominated by women was pharmaceutical science and  out of  lowest paying majors dominated by women were counseling and psychology early childhood education human services and community organization and social work i think one of the variables that needs to be taken into account is a females natural aptitudes and their value to society for example the history of stenography and secretarial work demonstrates the history of how a once maleonly profession became available to women but at the cost of lower pay because they could secretarial work and stenography was only a male profession colleges that taught these subjects only admitted males historically this is the recent past if you go far back in history the work of scribes a once highly honored position was also the work of males from the book out of the kitchen and into the office by lynn peril a case history of poaching jobs from men unlike typing stenography had a long history of male practitioners in  the author of starting in life what each calling offers ambitious boys and young men warned his readers that save for the as yet mostly male bastion of the newspaper office the woman stenographer had become an office fixture and necessity women had even infiltrated the ranks of court reports where they had been long considered too delicate to hear the litany of greed murder lust and corruption not to mention the occasional indecency of language they might be subjected to when taking trial testimony the reason for womens success as stenographers was obvious the author concluded so long as the woman continues to work at a lower price than is paid to the man for a similar service the man cannot compete with the woman on what may be assumed to be the womans ground he thus warned boys to pause and reflect and then to pause again and to continue to reflect for several days or weeks before entering a profession which has comparatively few prizes to offer and has very little substantial reward even for those who draw a prize the women it seemed had devalued what once had been a mans noble calling i hope the above provides a good example of how womens work has been devalued historically and why i as a medical transcriptionist for  years with a year work history in the field of just secretarial work am presently paid the same wages as a garbage truck driver would make at the start of his career if it was up to choice why would i not have chosen to be a garbage truck driver could it possibly be because of the strength requirements ie a males natural aptitude,1,NOT
this video misses the point ok men do work in jobs that pay more and sometimes this is due to danger or time worked but it doesnt explain why a skilled but feminised profession like nursing which is both skilled and difficult pays fast food wages looking at the caring professions in general even skilled and important ones such as day care social work and nursing professions which women gravitate to and by coincidence they all pay low the argument that businesses would employ women if it were true wtf try and find  women oil rig workersor plumbersor engineers stooopid argument but industry happily does underpay in the professions that women prefer too complex to work out the reason nah in the past when women started working and moved into these fields men payed the wages and undervalued their work the present situation is a result of the past so we can say that the reason for this difference is complex which it probably is or acknowledge that it is unfair regardless of how complex the reason for the present factual situation is and rather than forcing women to move into jobs they might not care for pay them fairly where they predominantly can be found lastly im a guyi dont believe in the premise that this is all down to toxic masculinity but im also not going to deny what is right in front of me my sister is skilled and works with brain damaged adults getting payed  dollars an houri work as a night attendant at a university opening and closing doors requiring no skill or carei get  dollarshappy i dont careand thus get payed a living wage,1,NOT
but isnt the question why is there a gender gap in the number of people pursuing certain careers,1,NOT

the ad i got for this video was a video saying that woman that join prostitution dont have a choice i would argue differently and i hope prageru would too,1,NOT
you can use similar conflating variables to explain away the racial pay gap you cant credibly cite equal pay for equal work when the demographics you are discussing are not getting equal work in the first place unconscious biases which affect hiring  promotion  evaluation remain things that show up in serious studies time and time again in spite of claims based mom make here toxicity in too many education and professional environments often leave only the women who are willing to tough it out often at great costs to their minds and hearts as the weinstein revelations show and on the based mom thing why prageru long after the revelations that have come out about fellow gator hero milo after the gator conspiracies and handwaving excuses have been exposed for what they are are you continuing to be affiliate with and promote in your ads anyone even remotely associated with that altriech terrorist campaign masquerading as citizenjournalism nevermind based mom of all people she thinks mentally ill kids should just tough out harassment and physical abuse in public schools we see the fruit of such policies on that which is swept under the rug as bullying it costs lives chs was a disgusting oftdiscredited woman even before she affiliated with that fake movement over an imagined review for a free game she is the stella kbler of our time and prageru is made all the less credible by her involvement,1,NOT

could also add that women usually spend more money and are easier affected by marketing tricks so even if paid more they would still end with less,3,NOT
there is a wage gap its cuz women dont work as many hours,1,NOT
funny they never mentioned the gender rolls that affect those numbers men of course are more likely to take longer hours because men are by many studies secondary in child bearing so the fact that men are just more willing does not cover the whole story,1,NOT
great presentation and makes sense the only problem i have is with the title it is incredibly misleading the reality is there is a significant gender wage gap however you look at this women work less hours do less dangerous work and essentially whine more in new york city young professional women make more money doing the same job as their male counterparts in addition lesbians and black women make more money than their white counterparts doing the same work why because they tend to put in longer hours but regardless there is a gender wage gap lol ,1,NOT
so yesterday i was in history and my teacher started to pedal the wage gap myth i tried to debunk her but i didnt get enough evidence and almost got a lunch detention i really wish i had this video then lmao,1,NOT
i kinda understand why mothers work lesser in their jobs,1,NOT
is it not a valid argument that women should be encouraged to do work that is male dominated such as cleaning sewers repairing cars making roads building houses fighting wars and that men should do more childcare nursing schooling social work and hairdressing,1,NOT
alright hb visas for everyone this is a good source for women that are immigrating,2,NOT
aaaand mic drop,1,NOT
this is garbage lying with statistics ,2,NOT
some people are more incompetent thant others so are paid less significantly,1,NOT
thank you for saying the truth,1,NOT
it just depends on how you define wage gap if you define it as women earn less than men then there is a wage gap if you define it as women earn less than men on the same career path then theres still one its just much smaller if you include the discrimination of females from choosing certain career paths then theres still a large gap anyway so there is a wage gap the debate is how big it is,1,NOT
i hope no one actually believes anything on this channel,1,NOT
a lot of women get paid less than men bc theyre willing to work for less and they sometimes work fewer hours to take care of their kids or something now thats not a problem at all but its true,1,NOT
years ago i told my female friend that our job is hiring her pay would be about double of what she was earning at the time little over minimum wage her eyes lit up big company all the benefits about half workers are female nothing she couldnt manage she was all for it until i told her its a night shift she flat out told me oh i cant work that from that point on i stop feeling sorry for her crying on fb how she is broke,1,NOT
you not considering that working women tend to have kids and female artist get paid much less compare to male actors,1,NOT
just like there is no legitimate education in prageru,1,NOT
there is but its just way smaller than  cents,1,NOT
i thought she was with the wage gap at the start who else,1,NOT
i love this video i just wish the comment section could be as objective and intelligent than just toxic and hateful you can consume knowledge and understand those who you strongly disagree with without completely becoming assholes but assholes love to live in comment sections cause theyre unable to do anything really to help make things better other than yell insults and raise their own stress levels and overall make the internet an assholish place,1,NOT
you are doing a justice to the world by making this video,1,NOT
i know of only one wage gap wa ge,1,NOT
this myth have been debunked a thousand times but to leftists that doesnt matter they will keep spreading their lies as far as they can,2,NOT
because men are better workers than women its simply hard for a women to accept  ,5,ABU
can somebody explain the american definition of fulltime employment thanks,1,NOT
thank you at our high school there is a club just for women where they say that women are oppressed they get less of everything and just about everyone there has some kind of demented social justice propaganda,1,NOT
look guys  you use the word feminist as if every liberal female is one the libtards make up a very small minority of the left wing political persuasion its such a double standard to call the other side retarded when youre own is so far from perfect itself,2,NOT
in every sector in which i have worked women have earned as much as me  because pay has been based on position and any difference has been based on experience merit increases and education my girlfriend and i earned exactly the same amount when we did the same job when i worked in health care there were  women for each man  and those women earned more than me because they were nurses and i was a technician at the time my exwife worked for an energy company and earned literally  more than me,1,NOT
damn this video is just as sexy as anything youd find on pornhub,2,NOT
but its obviously not as explicit as one singular employer having one man and woman whom he pays an unequal amount its not that clear cut and youd be naive and frankly ignorant to believe so its a systemic issue we devalue womens jobs and have created an atmosphere where women are discourage from taking careers in fields such stem or medicine typically the higher paying jobs alternatively the explanation for the gap in positions would be that women simply arent smart enough to earn the top positions,1,NOT
what the f there is a wage gap i got paid  when my fsb collugue got pain ,2,NOT
thomas sowell aproves,1,NOT
this wage gap is just another scapegoat for communism,1,NOT
is there are option to like a video more than once,1,NOT
i agree with with many of the points in this video however i do think it would have been interesting to look into why there was a higher concentration of women in low paying fields i noticed many of the lower paying fields could be seen as more of a nurturing career path perhaps linked to the traditional idea of femininity and as said in the video workers who were more willing to be on call at all hours were better funded but being on call for single mothers  of single parent households would be difficult also in many households the mother is seen as the prime child carer limiting their ability to take on roles with round the clock call in,1,NOT
even as a feminist i can agree with this it makes sense another factor on this is that a lot more women stay home im not saying that all women do it but a much larger majority do causing statistics to be shaky,1,NOT
i would really like a way to find your sources please,1,NOT
shouldnt it be a  cent gap shrinking to a  cent gap you go from showing the alleged percentege of a womans earnings or  cents to the dollar  to the actual gap between men an women its just a confusing way to use the graphics it should be  cents shrinking to  or a  growing to a ,1,NOT
did she blink,1,NOT
even if there is or isnt a wage gape any intelligent person will agree that sexism still runs through our world and culture,1,NOT
its not sexism its common sense lmao big facts,1,NOT
this video is ridiculous the problem is that women are paid less for doing the same job so when a field employs more women the average income in that field decreases because women are paid less than men the reverse is also true men get paid more for the same job so a fields annual income will average out higher because they hire mostly men,1,NOT
why is it all the time when i just type a simple somewhat conservative statement on an issue just to find an article or video out about an issue i constantly find myself on this prageru nutjob channel,1,NOT
i think youtube is up to something i searched up gender pay gap myth and the top results were liberal videos with just over mil views when normally this video should come up because it had more views i liked this video but when i came back it said that i hadnt liked it google and youtube tries to censor out the right and promote their own left ideologies typical,1,NOT
this video causes femenazis and cultural marxists to explode,5,ABU
about time someone put up a video that shows truth,1,NOT
my teacher decided to lie to my whole class and say that the gender wage gap is real now im changing schools because i have a bad teacher and need a better education that doesnt include all this drama on feminism and liberalism,1,NOT
is there a gender wage gap well yes but actually no,2,NOT
this is interesting however the reason why women make different choices on career and pay is because our society constantly influences women on the idea that they arent worth as much as men and that they cannot amount to that by that regard if i was raised with alot of influences that my gender is subordinate to another would greatly affect my choices for my career and my actions to ask for higher pay honestly your channel is no better than the young turks or breitbart,1,NOT
best channel on round planet earth the feminists live on the flat earth with those other potatoes,5,ABU
most people who have a brain can work this out by themselves but because femenist are dillusional its pointlessly explaining it they may aswell think the earths flat,5,ABU

what a boss holy sht,2,NOT
 a bit of a mistake here median isnt average average grabs all outliers whereas median selects the middle number,1,NOT
so its been thoroughly debunked by trusted institutes yet feminists still cry about this and how can you downvote this its pure facts thats the equivalent of a child plugging their ears and yelling real loud because they dont want to go to bed or something,1,NOT

k triggered feminists,1,NOT
absolutely brilliant wonderful work,1,NOT
no no its true the wage gap is real and its because of sexism every single company that exists is either secretly in league with every other company to pay women  of what men make or its just total coincidence that every single company that exists pays women  of what a man makes because they all sit around in their offices smoking big fat cigars tossing rolls of  bills into the fire all while laughing like like stereotypical fat british business owners from the s,1,NOT
what us funny im getting a degree in councling and have a job set up once im done with school yet the job i got pays  a year starting off and after  years working for them ill be making  a year if i get my dr ill be making   a year be smart ppl choice a job that pays better,1,NOT
a female with no job earns  less than a male working as fighter pilot  putting his life at risk for the previous females safety he probably earns more because of sexism,1,NOT
my mother believes that the wage gap exists and says that women dont have equal rights but she also claims that she doesnt agree with todays feminism someone please explain me her logic,1,NOT
a lot of guys work longer,1,NOT
finally someone smart enough to tell me this,1,NOT
it seems the two sides are talking past each other again even after explaining why the gender gap is there is clearly still a conversation to be had why is this the case that women are making these choices to be less prosperous then men and what role socialization has to do with it this problem however is a whole different problem from the original idea of women being paid less for the same work and has different implications still running back to the  wage gap buzzphrase is irresponsible and really the words coming out of peoples mouths should be more something along the lines of women are living less prosperously and ambitiously then men what could the implications of this be,1,NOT
this lady also forgot to mention occupational segregation occupational segregation is seen in trends when people hold what were once considered stereotypically gendered jobs like women being nurses and men being doctors the previously maledominated jobs continue to pay more and the traditionally femaletrack jobs tend to pay less to this day,1,NOT
i like this woman we need more of them,1,NOT
in  years there will be male suffragettes,2,NOT
 this isnt sexism its just common sense feminists and libtards get kod once again,1,NOT
el coo de la madre,6,ABU
this isnt sexism its just common sense,1,NOT
the real problem with women in the work force is there are stigmas against women doing certain jobs and some male and even female employers would rather hire a man thinking hed do a better job this happens less and less year after year as less and less we are told to pursue careers that are for girls or for boys so there is an issue but its not the lack of equal pay for equal work,1,NOT
anybody else notice that womans eyes were huge,1,NOT
gee i wonder who disliked this video,1,NOT
women are really social and caring creatures we are so blessed to have women in our lives,1,NOT
i have to show this video to my libtard infested school,1,NOT
im for equal pay men get way less than women in the porn industry ,2,NOT
my friend tried to debate me on this she believes all this stuff about the wage gap but when i tried to explain to her that the statistics dont account for different jobs she said no women get paid less for working the same job i asked her what specific jobs she meant then and she said the jobs they do studies on that drove me nuts you cant just read a study and not even look at where they got the information like seriously what do people think happen that women just get handed a  cent check at subway after their shift and men get handed a dollar you cant pay people differently just based on their gender anyways i should show her this video,1,NOT
i love these videos thank you prageru for opening my mind,1,NOT
makes me feel that the left is just trying to use any excuse to pick a fight with society,1,NOT
wage gap only existed in the early s but it also had child labor and even than the gap is a misconception,1,NOT
if men truly did make  more than women then that would be a truly raw deal for men  men die on the job  times more than women  men are  times more likely to work two jobs and work over time  men have a much much higher injury rate and burn out rate  men have less perks a lot of companies dont have paternity leave  men by far work more dangerous jobs and more remote jobs  men see their families far less  men are the vast majority of combat deaths and for all that men only get  more its should be  or  times more now if the gov forces salaries to be equal then its clearly men who get screwed yes when we hear  women and  men died in a coal mine accident then talk about equality until then men are screwed,1,NOT
would be nice to see the source for the papers that are mentioned in the video a quick google search didnt help me,1,NOT
you guys are amazing at explaining everything,1,NOT
it is not just about choice since the beginning women have been held at lower standards than men and it has been going on even now in ,1,NOT
it literally says in this video that the  c wage gap still exists after accounting for all choices she killed her own argument and then just ignores it by saying the key word here is choice,1,NOT
can we have one for britsh men and woman,1,NOT
ive operated consulted for and owned various businesses like most entrepreneurs administrators consultants and executive my focus was hiring persons who were smarter than i was less for me to do and maximizing profits if i could have hired women and paid them less than men for the same job i would never have hired men the fact that men have these overpaid jobs and are even hired is contrary to any bottomline consideration and that is the big lie in all this,1,NOT
who would expect a conservative group to consider every fact right me neither all the arguments that try to explain why there isnt any wage gap miss out one thing of course you know that but you constantly manage to ignore it women have to give birth and therefore  need a stable environment  cant just be available   cant just move around the world as firms want them to i consider a loving father to say the same things but as workers need to get more flexible because the companies are outsourcing their risk to the employees men have to addict to such injustices the real problem is the worker unfriendly workplace,1,NOT
i have been tortured for  years by the same old tired arguments of gender pay differences my career was in graphic design  advertising in nyc where my skills and education so far outpaced those of my peers both male and female that the real joke is why did i remain in that profession nonetheless in summary i encountered example after example company after company where in general females were paid more than males go figure,1,NOT
man i want to go to school here,1,NOT

i put this in watch later so i can show to every stupid feminist who uses this,2,NOT
more women graduate college than men close the education gap,1,NOT
so this video is incorrectly titled there is a wage gap it just isnt as high as most people think,1,NOT
did you make this video to test the conservative point of view ive been in the work force for  years and yes theres a gender wage gap to use an argument such as men are willing to be on call at all times etc is why theyre paid more is not valid women who work the same long hours and are available at all hours get paid less period companies wouldnt hire just women to save the  because they still believe men can do a better job even if it costs more,1,NOT
can i have the links to the websites that you used so that i can show them the websitez when im asked for proof i can list them,1,NOT
is it possible instead of pharmaceutical commercials we could buy up the entire first commercial break on abcnbccbs nightly news to finally end this nonsense,1,NOT

follow the money the wage gap myth resulted in obama increasing woman only grants for college and small business,1,NOT
based mom ftw,1,NOT
the people making the claim who are stupid they do not know the difference between wages and earnings there are very very few companies paying different wages the majority is min wage how much your earnings are depend on how much work you do in hrs at the wage you are on,1,NOT
 feminists disliked this video,1,NOT
i mostly agree with this video although i think there are some things one still has to consider as you mentioned there still is a wage gap between men and women for the same work which you explained as being the cause of men being more willing to do long hours but why is that biological differences between men and women arent that big so that they would allow us to say that the reason is biological no its the way how men and women are raised differently in our society thats also the reason why most women work in lower paid jobs as you mentioned at the beginning because we raise them to work in these jobs thats the core of the whole gender wage gap discussion,1,NOT
no thats not how it works these are all reliable facts but these have all been already considered its still true that women often earn less for the exact same work over the exact same time instead watching stupid videos on youtube that actually have a rightwinged agenda you should inform yourself properly,1,NOT
i clicked this thinking you was that dr sham guy or whatever,1,NOT
you work at the same job but do you work as a manager with a good education background and for  hours a day no then dont complain you make  cents less now go make me a sandwich,3,NOT
this stupid myth is imposed by the socalled feminists but the only thing it seeks is a way to generate inequality and at the same time victimization which is its only flag what a joy it is a lady that makes such a good explanation and k feminazis do not like this xd,5,ABU
so rn based on the like to dislike ratio there are k people pro equality and k feminists neat,1,NOT
if it was a man explaining the video there would be so much rage in the comments,1,NOT
im actually amazed to see a womens organization release a non biased report there it is ladies right from the horses mouth p,1,NOT
i love science and logic over social stupidity thank you thank you so much,1,NOT
the view count is encouraging whenever i say without disclaimer feminists are liars people still look at me like thats an unfair blanket statement hopefully this video will encourage people to look further into the methodology of ascertaining the socalled information that feminists try to disseminate to the public to call it misleading is too mild  like saying that steamed rotting dog shit served with maggots just isnt your cup of tea,2,NOT
 male in math and computer science thats bull shitt there are no females in any of my classes ,2,NOT
here in germany at my university there was a whole day dedicated to the gender wage gap and all those mindless drones spewed out the same nonsense and when you tried to debate them they kept yapping circular arguments ,1,NOT
and let me ask why is it that best paid jobs are dominated by males and worst paid jobs by females i mean as a scientist arguing that there are so so soooo many variables i cant handle them all doesnt mean the correlation isnt real theres a wage gap as tiny as you want it to be and theres a clear difference in how jobs are distributed theres also a habit from males to work longer hours or night shifts while women wont these are all correlations telling you something you cant deny their existence and thats why we are all saying theres sexism involved the reason behind sexism well we have to figure it out thats science awful video really,1,NOT
women complaining that they get paid less than men is like tall people complaining that santa claus only hires midgets to work for him in the north pole,1,NOT
isnt prager university a c im all for the facts and this video defiantly has some however remember that theyre only giving you evidence that supports their argument its great to be informed but dont narrow your information to only one source,1,NOT
this is amusing they should do this study at walmart where i get paid  an hour ft and am expected to train men they hire at  an hour to do the exact same job,1,NOT
you know i am not a fan of what every single thing feminist say but there is a wag gap it is a fact that the wage gap exist it just is a fact the wage gap and if you talk to people who understand the wage gap they will tell you this takes into consideration or account different choices men and women make such as job position total hours worked also number of children and the frequency at which unpaid leave is taken in addition to other factors they do take into account the type of degree one receives in college every feminist knows this but what feminist also bring up that people hate hearing which is a real factor that exist is discrimination which accounts for  of the wage gap according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the us has the th largest gender pay gap overall and the gap in this country is bigger than the gap in most european countries the economic policy institute says in simple terms no matter how you measure it there is a gap also the reason women make the choices they do get the college degrees they do could be the result of a sexist culture maybe not saying that is the case,1,NOT
the wage gap is there people just didnt do there research on the company if you didnt know this is isnt a place to be getting information from,1,NOT
it actually works out better for women who on the whole live longer than men why im sure the overwork and long hours that men work takes more of a toll on their health,1,NOT

hostile work environments tradesmen skilled labor jobs carpenters electricians machinists and oil field workers are all predominantly male occupied and you can make a lot money doing them women gravitate towards hospitality jobs nursing day care and almost every job pertaining to taking care if children unfortunately they dont pay as much enough said,1,NOT
why are men more able as was said at ,1,NOT
so happy that its a woman telling this,1,NOT
wonder if ever any feminist will complain about the consumption gap because i can bet women end up wasting much more money then men and those sad oppressed girls dont even get to use their own money on those dresses,3,NOT
thank you for releasing this video on my birthday ,1,NOT
why do people still even have to make this video,1,NOT
what are their motives for perpetuating the myth,1,NOT
i love how feminists say on average women make  of a mans wages if that is the average there must be women out there making  you have to have a range of numbers to make an average why isnt there court cases of businesses being sued for paying women less,1,NOT

why do people still get their panties in a bunch over this its been debunked so many times,1,NOT
what horse bsfacts just look at fortune  companies and look at the same positions and pay,2,NOT
she makes a lot of sense until she reaches the point where she tries to explain the    gap by citing an example of a different variable other than gender and then somehow feeling satisfied that this means that the gender pay gap is basically nonexistent why does she need to take the complete opposite side of the argument and say that the gender wage gap doesnt exist at all why cant she concede that its possible that gender accounts for a noninsignificant part of the  unexplained gap,1,NOT
cant agree with more audi made a  super bowl commercial regarding this gender wage gap issue i decided to boycott audi after watching it i cant do much but i do what i can to show my disagreement with their lie,1,NOT
i personally think that a good portion of the actual wage gap comes from men being more aggressive when it comes to requesting raises and are willing to over compensate when wanting the raise my wife for one was fine with just being a crew member i encouraged her to work harder and show her employers that she is worth more than what they are paying her within  months she was offered shift lead and i continued to boost her confidence and pushed her to stay on top of things giving her advice on how to prove herself she pushed and worked harder she out shined most of her co workers with in a year she was made management i helped her develop the tools needed to excel and succeed in the job she liked i encourage her and stand behind her whenever she feels that she isnt doing good enough and help her reach the stars because she means so much to me and i can see that her success makes her happy she never would have accomplished so much with out a mans outlook to guide her not saying she would have eventually gotten the position on her own but she would have taken much much longer the way she was handling it she is strong without me but she is even stronger with me we are partners and she outshines me now and i am so proud of her,1,NOT
k feminists did not even start the video,1,NOT
this video is very informative im glad i watched it all the way through i always believed in the wage gap until this video,1,NOT
ah prager u even a broken clock is right twice a day,1,NOT
holy crap i was wondering why she was so familiar and then she stated her name and then i got so giddy because of it,1,NOT

i like her,1,NOT
every woman i know who talks about the wage gap hasnt even attempted research outside of buzzfeed on it,1,NOT
is it so weird that difrend jobs making difrend money i mean you realy think a grocer should make the same money as a underwater welder like i work outside working with trees and other greens i have no airco in the summer and no heater in the winter i do heavy manuel labor and i walk and stand the whole day but i love it but its a all mens job not because we dont wanna hire women its because women dont wanna do this job but let me be clear man and female should be payed equel for the same job and same hours that goes for being a secretarieassistent but also for working in construction same pay same labour,1,NOT
i lean left on most issues but this video makes a lot of sense,1,NOT
i want to do one of the worst jobs and one of the best then again i would probably do most of those and i love science,1,NOT
or we should pay them both equally so whoever wants to stay home can stay home and have the job they want to someone want stay home and have kids thats great for them somebody else wants to go to work men women it doesnt matter we should treat them like human beings with dignity and respect,1,NOT
im only acquainted with the statistics in sweden where the unexplained wage gap is  i think the last point of this video where men in average work longer hours in full time jobs is a factor that should be looked at more according to last years report by scb men work an average of  minutes more per week,1,NOT
finally the bulk of child care even within in a marriage is still traditionally placed on the women in the partnership and not the man although as women outperform men in college education see another prager u essay perhaps more men will stay at home with the children and work the less demanding jobs,1,NOT
i know that i am being kind of picky here but median is not the average median is just the number that appears in the stats and is not the average in many cases mean is the average just saying again i know that i sound picky for saying this but i just like math a lot and dont want even a small risk of people getting confused there are a lot of idiots online,1,NOT
i had to get into a discussion about this with peers and let me tell you when i said that its a myth that got pissed their line i did the research and that its  pages long and all i asked was what businesses make a wage gap and i almost got hit after class it was hilarious,1,NOT
wow this is simply not truth and yes we know why there is this  gap there are thousands of studies proving that if men were taking care of every single activity that women are expected to do outside their professional activities like working at home cleaning or taking care of kids women simply could take these men jobs and earn more because there are no naturally men jobs this is not simply a math issue but a gender gap in social responsibilities between women and men and this is science not a myth or any math error by spreading these messages you show a clear ideological point of view and not a scientific one as you want is to believe,1,NOT
before this i was watching edm and anime vids saw the ad and literally subbed immediately finally some real truth in our world we need more of that,1,NOT
no feminists are going to believe this if a mans the one taking in this video oh wait feminists arent even going to believe this,1,NOT
its not surprising this obvious propaganda works on braindeads the culling will be swift and without mercy,1,NOT

im a progressive but the left blows this out of proportion that being said there is almost certainly a small wage gap attributed to discrimination also prageru can eat shit conservative propaganda,1,NOT
if men make more money than women then why dont businesses just hire all women because thats not how ceos negotiate payat all how little a boss pays their employees is based on what they can get away with while negotiating wages there is a reason why employees are discouraged from discussing their salaries with one another its to keep pay negotiations in favor of the boss and in a hypothetical environment such as an office building with more men in it than women you can get away with paying women a lower salary by making it difficult to compare her earnings with other employees,1,NOT
mom and dad work in the same job mom worked for  hours and got paid  dad worked for  hours and got  problem solved,1,NOT

she is trolling again lmao trisha is actually intelligent but she pretends to be dumb,3,NOT
if being transgender isnt superficial then why do trans women undergo thousands of dollars of painful surgery take hormones and adopt certain mannerisms to conform to societys stereotypes of women or is trans territory exclusively for males,3,NOT
honestly was my favorite an the best one so far ab trisha coming out  straight facts,2,NOT
she sounds like a toddler that just started talking about trans peopleshe just sounds confused ,3,NOT
i guess what makes people get negative the most is also the fact that she monetized all those videos including this last one today first one has two ads mil views aka at least k second one has three ads mil views aka around k and this last one has four ads which will no doubt reach a million views at least so all in all with those last three vids thats anywhere from k at the minimum to k all this in three days thats why people amongst other things but mainly i feel took it as oh just another clickbait troll stunt from trisha the chicken nugget she is who she is and usually id tell her she doesnt need to explain anything but this time it def got icky somehow and she has to take serious action to rectify the damage shes done i think she should be demonetizing those videos or better donating all the money from them to the lgbtq community with proof despite all i truly believe she cares about this community and that she didnt intend anything badthe only thing that could make me question that is her keeping that money  i think she is just a very dependant person who absorbs the personality of whoever is in her life at that time and who then has an identity crisis when that person gets out of her life its not necessarily a bad thing she could def turn this around be an award winning actress with what is originally a more negative personality traits lol but the girl needs to go away for a while alone on a vacation and concentrate on finding herself once and for all but thats just my long opinion ,3,NOT
blaire really why why are we talking about this lol,1,NOT

one of the things i hate most about all of this is that its trendy to as you say come out its trendy to be progressive its trendy to be part of an oppressed or marginalized community,2,NOT
blaire i literally waited for your response so i can decide how her video was supposed to make me feel,2,NOT
love you but kill myself was dumb,2,NOT
this is vodka btwhow i felt through out the whole video,1,NOT
i wonder if trisha even knows what gender dysphoria is,2,NOT
i cant stand her shes an attention whore and an annoying one at that,5,ABU
keep in mind though trisha paytas is one of the biggest trolls on youtube she intentionally makes up controversial bullshit to drive traffic to her channel and create disagreements and arguments in her comment sections she doesnt actually think shes trans she just wants ad revenue and knows people will click this video to tell her shes an idiot,5,ABU
i think she is being serious,1,NOT
speaks facts and eats chickfila if this isnt a modern queen idk what is,2,NOT
all of the people that scream if they say theyre trans believe them are the same people saying fuck you trish youre not trans in her comments lmao,2,NOT
love your videos bitch come party with me in new orleans,2,NOT
trisha is just a troll who wants to get people taking she isnt transgender shes trans stupid,5,ABU
trisha forgot a part the transgender community always called mean idiot,3,NOT
ive pretended to be a guy online since i was  ive been an adult for years now but that doesnt mean im transgender i also dont wear makeup or do things that are considered girly can i not be a girl and just do whatever i feel like doing with my bodymind do i have to shave wear makeup high heels dresses and talk like a preppy cali girl to convince people im female how you act and dress doesnt determine anything i dont act like a girl online because girls get too much attention too many guys talk to me if i give myself a girl name andor picture its annoying im not going to call myself trans though thats so fucking stupid transtrenders are annoying attention seekers trisha just wants the views and  very obvious as usual,6,ABU
this is the problem with mass promotion of lgbt you get trenders and fakes and people so confused they accept the crazy as normal,5,ABU
i hope thrisha is sarcastic and joking,2,NOT
blaire you couldnt make an ugly face even if you tried,1,NOT
maybe gigi is trolling and just wants everyone to start calling trisha a man ,2,NOT

like like like i think shes transgrammar ,2,NOT
oh shes a troll and meming,3,NOT
im with you on trisha not being trans and everything you said related to trans specifically but i dont understand the need to invalidate nonbinary people,3,NOT
i think shes being serious because she just seems like someone who would be that dumb and stupid to say something like that she seems really unstable and that this is either a coping mechanism or cry for attention or shes actually that confused either way if she is being serious i get that she might not always want to have to put the effort out to be the most beautiful woman ever but just because she doesnt like that does not make her trans lmao she need some milk,5,ABU
honestly if this isnt a troll then her ramblings sound like someone having an identity crisis someone that doesnt fit in anywhere and everyone is kind of against her no one really accepts her anywhere by her own fault of her trolling and being an idiot so shes trying to find something to explain her confusion with who she is and where she fits in the world again by the  chance shes not trolling,5,ABU
muscles glistening in the wind  ,2,NOT

sam smith is a feminine gay man just like the majority of gay men he speaks about non binary like a infant always being fooled by peekaboo  ,5,ABU
have you seen her mess of an apology video i feel like shes not trolling anymore and it makes me really sad you should reach out to her and have like a conversation she needs help and i think whatever gender therapist shes seeing doesnt know wtf theyre talking about,5,ABU
your cat is adorable,1,NOT
oh man i was so on board with this video until you decided to shit on nonbinary people ,2,NOT
trisha looks like a crackhead,5,ABU

these community just full of gender stereotype pink blue pastel dark red whatever it just color just like whatever you like it have nothing to do with trans make up or not it doesnt making you be more or less girl we just dress whatever we want to feels good and comfortable about ourselves as much as how furry cant turned to be real fox from what they wear or not wear you are not gonna be more or less female just from make up too it just what you choose to wear making you feels good im a girl i love blaire but that still doesnt make me trans i just think shes so hot my sis love gays and want to be gay but thats just her fetish of yaoi i guess just being who you are love yourself wear whatever you want but if you want to cut your boobs well then you maybe trans,2,NOT
god damnit that woman is ugly,5,ABU
shes a troll shes doing it for views and to stay relevant which is what all these response videos are giving her yall think youre so smart but in reality youre just giving her what she wanted lol,3,NOT

glistening in the wind ,2,NOT
girl really got tired of sexism and decided to transition to male lmao,2,NOT
i dont wanna judge but since i know theyre not gonna see it and it was bugging me for a long time im gonna say it i think my friend became a trans man because of his fetish for gay men even before he came out as a guy i would constantly see and hear him talk about all the gay guy he like however me as a lesbian cis woman whenever i wanted to talk about my crushes on girls he would stop listening to me or even say how gross and weird that is woman with a woman gross from supposedly gay guy wow,1,NOT
i used to like her but now she just scares me,1,NOT
i was really hoping to see this tea in my inbox,1,NOT

shes a giant troll nothing is too low or too much for her imagine living a life where every second is about creating drama this coming out video is way to far over the line,3,NOT
i would fuck this disgusting mess of a being maybe off myself after but ill deal with that bridge when i come,6,ABU
im a transgender female trisha is notorious for being a troll its hard to believe her her reasoning for being trans is absolutely wack if she wants to be trans no one has an issue with that but i have no clue if this is a troll,3,NOT
so shes clearly nuts and is extraordinarily unbalanced mentally  with all of these little admissions of hers that much is obvious looks like a woman acts like some women thinks like some women clearly a woman  and she even knows she was born female has female biology and everything outward indicates an identification with this but thinks she transsexual but also or has in the past thinks shes you know what it doesnt even matter you get a person saying certain things out loud and they just lose all credibility  the chances of a person coming back from that and ever mentally being capable of handling more or being more are slimtonone shes not ever going to get more intelligent she was an idiot then and is still clearly an idiot now this is the problem with insular thinking particularly when youre not even remotely intelligent or capable of honest selfanalysis or selfawareness  you think stupid things for terrible or nonreasons and then you start to believe them because this stuff never came out of your mouth in the presence of intelligent honest critical people if it ever did at all  trisha was never set straight and had it explained to her why she is wrong and will likely never be right for the rest of her existence best case scenario shes a troll that thinks this is somehow a good idea and that just makes her an asshole and an idiot  worst case scenario she actually thinks this way and shes many neurons short a coherent thought and shes a different kind of idiot why are the available options never good all that saved me in this video was blaire  blaire and that adorable nosescratch she did,5,ABU
i mean i def think non binary is a thing it just wasnt as ubiquitous until recently or it can be a safe stepping stone for some people on the journey to discover how they want to present and live their life that being said trisha doesnt seem to really understand what it means to be trans or what it means to be nonbinary but thats just my opinion,2,NOT
haha im deceased ily blaire,1,NOT

hey  white ive followed you for awhile now  love your channel i am a registered nurse canadian  could not have agreed with you calvin  rose of dawn more about the jy ludicrousness  was literally yelling  them when they were live on your channel because most of what theyve said  done is just beyond bizarre creepy disgusting  they said soooo many untruths we have a phenomenal man by the name of lucas silveira who is a singersongwriter  has been a trans activist looooong before trans was even really known about he has a youtube channel  a mom to  sons my youngest who has severe autism  my oldest who is gay  his significant other is a trans man both professionally but even more so personally no hate towards trish but the moment she opened her mouth  the beginning of her video it was overtly obvious that she does not even have the slightest clue about what it is to be transgender so sad when someone thinks theyre being so intelligent  so knowing when the audience can see right through all of it  what its really all about something i liken to the story of the emperors new clothes except in trishs case everyone saw right through alllll of her bs love your channel love you  if this is ever something you do would love to have you on my live podcastdigital radio show sometime ,2,NOT

gigis video was well hmm confusing because her end conclusion was how we have to accept trishas assertion and therefore fight against ignorance while she ignored every ignorant thing trisha said like how trisha identified as trans because she wanted male privilege while still identifying with her birth gender that seems like the kind of ignorance hypocrisy that gigi might want to poke at just a bit,2,NOT

men shop themselves around more often especially early in their career women are far more likely to stay i their first job for longer while men are more likely to check the help wanted sections or hire a headhunter to try to find a higher paying job men are also more likely to ask for bigger raises at the end of the year the company isnt going to just give you a big raise every year if you dont ask when you compare men and women with similar everythingsimilar education similar years experience and a similar philosophy on work either both men and women who shop themselves around and change jobs frequently or both men and women who are content with their first job then the wage gap disappears entirely in fact then women get a few cents more,2,NOT
can you please cite your information in the description of your videos thank you i want to believe you but if you dont cite your sources its hard for me to take it as fact,1,NOT
sending this to my mum,1,NOT
men work harder and longer so they earn more many but feminists call this sexist ,2,NOT
ah my daily dose of logic and reasoning for the day  ,2,NOT
uhh no the facts you showed actually revealed that the male dominance of the high paying jobs which happens because the society and our culture encourage boys about having such job a lot more than girls creating the wage gapno its not because boys are better at stem the science itself already proved that girls are just as good as boys at math and science and etc also since our businesses were run by mostly males since the beginning of the word business the culture actually is more fit to men which also is the big reason of the wage gap women are discriminated just look at the facts,1,NOT
they say women are oppressed one minute then say women dont exist and there are really  genders another,3,NOT
i disagree i know a true real life example of a wage gap i know a professor who got a job in a southern college and was paid less than her husband who was hired a year later he has less education and less experience than she does and yet she was told that he earns more because he is head of the home and that they both receive the money so why does it matter how each of them get paid they quit and got a job at a college in the north instead she now gets paid more since she works harder than her husband and has more education and experience,1,NOT
the reason why they dont hire women in critical position is because they do not know how to make critical decisions never hire a women,5,ABU
mrs summers you shouldnt wear so much makeup,3,NOT
the wage gap is real but its only like  and it hasnt been proven to be an act of discrimination,2,NOT
what kind of character does someone have who dislikes this video good video though,2,NOT
while the problem is actually different than the one advertised it is a problem nonetheless encouraging women to choose the higher paying careers needs to take place as does increasing the wage for the lowest paying careers,1,NOT
they want equal pay have a good education have a career plan work longer like the men even tho it will last to midnight or over there problem solve dont like it deal with it,3,NOT
title there is no gender wage gap goes on to talk about how there is in fact a gender wage gap but dont worry if you make good choices then you can shrink it all the way down to a  cent difference which essentially means that even if you play your cards right you will be paid  percent less if youre a woman than if youre a man also want to point out how this lady goes and talks in a video about how bad boys are doing in school and getting worse grades than girls mainly because they spend too much time outside and therefore we need to change the system so that it can benefit them basically when it comes to girls its their job to adjust their choices to adapt to a system clearly built against them but when it comes to boys its the opposite since even though their poor performance in school is solely due to their own decisions we must change the system to benefit them yeah these guys basically just tell rightwing people what they want to hear friendly reminder that prager u is predominately funded by an oil tycoon and then comes out with a video called why you should love fossil fuels,2,NOT
um theology and religious vocations as worst paying jobs look throughout history the church is one of the biggest money traps average salary for a priest at one of those mega churches in the us is k,1,NOT
this intro is kind of dumb the reason businesses dont only hire women is because  the women will know that they are being paid less than if a man worked there and thats incredibly disrespectful  if a business hired only women men would be absolutely pissed and boycott all of the businesses and they would lose money before watching the whole video i believed in the wage gap now that i have other statistics i dont other than the fact that the information is dated its a good video,2,NOT
 butthurt feminists who deny facts disliked this video,2,NOT
i wondered how they calculated the wage gap but if they do it that way its not proving except that men earn more on average feel like showing this to my form tutor who always goes on bashing about men and how were the bain of all evil,2,NOT
the thing i dislike about these videos is the fact they name a source such as the us department of labor studies and use it to prove choice is to blame and dont link it anywhere in their videos,1,NOT
but isnt that the point of the wage gap to show that there is an overall difference in compensation yes of course that is not because some evil managers want to pay less money but because of personal choices which are a direct product of influences from our society there is a wage gap though it is not a matter of paying more or less but of a social issue that makes woman and men tend to different carreer choices i guess some people manipulate everything its just a shamr because the concept behind it is nice and would help both woman and men,2,NOT
this is so good im lost for words,2,NOT
counselling and psychology welp looks like ill have to find a new career then  its what ive stuck to for years now but since its one of the least paying jobs ill probably have to do something i wont enjoy to be able to afford things i wish my high school told me sooner because now i have to start all over again,1,NOT
as usual feminist want equality without responsibilities and want to earn more without working or less work these days feminist dont even understand that man put more efforts to earn more man doesnt sit in comfort zone he take risk he takes more pressure sit long hours in work,3,NOT
so many angry woman screaming at their screens right now,3,NOT
i thought about this for a min in particular the first question especially bc this logic would then apply to other wagegaps whether it ethnicity disabilities age and even something as small as employee physical appearance tall attractive people are statistically paid more so why not hire only short ugly people the reason is people inherently believe that the short ugly female etc person is worse at their jobs and deserves less pay or much more often they believe that the tall attractive white male will do a better job and therefore deserves more basically favouritism so to put it another way the first question implies that the hiring manager knows that a man and woman will perform the same task to the same ability but in reality prejudices impact how they perceive someone completing a task so the hiring manager will believe a white man will and does perform the job better and deserve more compensation,2,NOT
thaaaaaaaank yoooooouuuuuuu for making this video,2,NOT
i love this channel you always know which side of the world it stands on,2,NOT
i conceide this point however i will also say that i would rather make slightly less living a life i want to live with the profession major and schedule i am happiest and most able to work than chase dollars my entire life,1,NOT
fb is not letting shares of this vid go through but a cut and paste of the url seems to work,1,NOT
well explained and well produced,2,NOT
you know its a myth when its a woman tackling the topic,3,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense well i found my new catchphrase,2,NOT
i dont know why people still disagree with the pay gap when we have clear facts and evidence of it not existing and shame on those politicians celebrities etc for claiming it does exist so they get public favor,2,NOT
facts are mostly correct but the main question remains  why are those choices what women choose its because society doesnt provide a level playing field for women the expectation especially from the right is that women should take care of the children and thus make all the sacrifices,5,ABU
glad to see a woman narrating this video,2,NOT
while the gender pay gap may be exaggerated in somemany scenarios to prove a point this video neglects to mention anything on american work culture gender roles and previous cases of when employees of opposite sex but most identical profession responsibility and qualification receive noticeably different pay for their work for seemingly no other attributable factor and the legal action that has been effectively taken based on this,2,NOT
i was surprised to see a similar discussion with this video happening in japanit seems that there are people who like propaganda not a sober discussion in any country a politician who tried to make a cool argument would be crushed by the media it would happen in any country,2,NOT
there was another study done sorry im going on memory so the specific name of the study is gone in which they determined that women are less likely to negotiate for a higher rate less likely im sure there might be some yeah but not me so youre wrong replies les likely doesnt mean allofthewomen this could easily explain any remaining  gap,2,NOT
thank you for making this an adwoman are really stupid these days complaining and they need to stop,5,ABU
prageru could make a video justifying the recent bill passed in russia that decriminalizes domestic violence and still make it sound convincing and impactful,2,NOT
you know its true when a woman is telling this a woman is telling this,2,NOT
links pleases put links in all your videos,1,NOT
im saving this video so i can just link it to whoever thinks the wage gap is real a lot easier than having to repeat myself over and over again,2,NOT
big clap to this amazing woman  thanks for this excellent vid prager u,2,NOT
i dont know if it is a good thing or a bad thing but for me this is old news almost  year old news it is  and this is required to keep our structural society intact it is so sad,1,NOT
im a communist but the liberals are horrible now a days i hate feminist especially theres no wage gap,2,NOT
my female teacher told me that all female teachers had to sign a contract that included not asking male colleagues about their pay,2,NOT
several feminists are typing,2,NOT
she admits that there is a wage gap that contradicts the title of the video,2,NOT
lets be perfectly honest its got nothing to do with fairness or even economics its all about power and these feminist groups want that power if they could push themselves into the right seats they could effectively start deciding who would get certain benefits and life styles while others would regulated to ostracation this is communist manifesto ,2,NOT
cant believe i had to sit through the entirety of my class and my teachers feminazi extravaganza today and when i gave my twobits i was suddenly the sexist,2,NOT
anyone arguments against im interested certainly sources please,1,NOT
i just love to watch these videos and see other peoples perspectives all views are going to come from some source of truth which makes me think it could be more complicated than the analysis in this video,1,NOT
great video annoying comments stopping bashing each other geez,2,NOT
im confused doesnt this help prove that there is a gender wage gap precisely because men are in the high paying fields such as engineering and computer science while women are in more low paying fields such as education and social work yes it is each individuals choice to be in those fields but only because our society encourages them to go into those fields and still sets women up as the carers and teachers while setting men up as the brainiacs and scientists or athletes most of us dont do this on purpose but we all do it indirectly by supporting gender traditions like barbie vs hot wheels or the wife taking the last name of the husband and we have gender traditions for the worforce too for example picture an airline pilot and a flight attendant i always picture the pilot to be male and the flight attendant to be female same for me goes with chefserver doctornurse managerreceptionist i always thought this is what was meant by the gender wage gap which this video proved to be true not that companies are so sexist they literally pay men more than women to say that so many women choose these caretaker jobs over men and that so many men choose these intellectual jobs over women is all based on each individuals choice seems to be ignoring our gender defining culture right now we are still a fairly sexist society wouldnt that affect everything especially the workforce,2,NOT
its just common sense oof gut punch to dem feminist,3,NOT
this video is misinformed and misconstrues a georgetown study titled women cant win despite making educational gains and pursuing highwage majors women still earn less than men to manipulate its audience one main finding of the study is discrimination even when women do everything rightchoose a highpaying field of study pursue a highpaying major within that field and get a job in a highpaying occupationwomen still get paid less than their male peers if a man and woman who are equally qualified get the same job the woman still only earns  cents for every dollar the man is paidmore than cents to be sure but a far cry from earnings equality to not include this principal finding of the  page study is disrespectful to the truth of the gender wage gap which might not be that every woman earns  cents to every  dollar a man earns but it still exists at a  cent deficit according to the sited georgetown study shame to prageru for disrespecting the truth and mission of this study spreading factually incorrect data with conviction and manipulating its millions of viewers,1,NOT
sorry but i have to point out a mathematical error in this video starting about  seconds in the math is explained as the median earnings of all women working full time divided by the media earnings of all men working full time but then you give an example talking about the average income average and median are not the same thing in fact they can be very different,2,NOT
my sister dont believe me say that there a huge gap men get paid more just because there men,2,NOT
ladies always get more tips than guys,2,NOT
feminists say women get paid less while still hiring men because the patriarchial good boy club twisting their curling mustaches smoking their cigars and wearing top hats shined with female tears conspire to make sure women die on the job  of the time pay alimony  of the time get a  sentencing discount and get custody  of the time oh wait,3,NOT
my mom told me two different people one a man and one a woman were in the same job one after the other they had the exact same work and the same hours but not the same salary also works consider less good the moment women work in them i dont live in usa but here it works this way,2,NOT
yeah maddox already took care of this myths months ago,2,NOT
i wont be speaking in favour or against the wage gap argument but the methods used to compare whether there is a wage gap or no is idiotic at best its common sense to not use averages how about you take two people of the same profession working the same job in the same company with the only difference being their gender and see how much they earn per hour and not the total wage per month and then repeat that process over and over again with different jobs and companies only then can someone say whether the wage gap is still present or no,1,NOT
just to be clear there is no real prager university outside of this video production group prager university is really just republican propaganda,1,NOT
guys i am doing a debate if the gender pay gap is due to the choice of women employment and i am against anybody help me out with good arguments,1,NOT
okay this is epic what is ben shapiros wifes job,1,NOT
ok finally nice video but stillwhy women wont chose a higher paid jobs instead ofsocial work psychology education hmmmm,2,NOT
im pretty sure that she made the video with her shirt tucked lopsided,1,NOT
every time a crazy feminist is asked for evidence wage gap all men r   ,2,NOT
because a lot of male workers also attracts more business in a male dominated world,3,NOT
i dont know why but im always surprised when i see a woman going against feminists and their made up crap,2,NOT
also nursing is a good career path and is like  women i could have made k a year working nights in a psych unit at my first job but i chose a job on day shift paying k a year i now make k but would have been making k if i kept the night job,1,NOT
the gender wage gap is foolish you get paid for what you do just because you are a female doesnt mean you can do easy jobs and expect a high wage most of the people who take risk and toil hard are men as i know most of the women get promoted easily regardless of how they work i have seen males work so hard fighting hard to get promoted but this woman deserves greater credit,2,NOT
when evidence contradicts your theory  your theory is wrong as the video acknowledges  there is a pay gap an australian study of over  occupations showed that women earn more than men in only one highpaying job in australia and that women only out earned men in jobs that were low paid anyway data from australian tax office as the australian study found  there is no such thing as a job where women are taking home large pay packets but men are not the median income for jobs favouring men was up to eleven times higher than the median income for jobs favouring women and it does make a fundamentally flawed assumption  that corporations do the hiring they dont individual managers make hiring decisions  and rarely are their incentives aligned with corporate objectives a corporation may claim equality but individual managers have to handle staff absences when women are off having children  consciously and sub consciously there is an incentive to hire and promote men  and thus pay women less to discourage them from accepting a role the final flawed logic is that we cant explain why there is a discrepancy therefore we cant claim that there is one the claim was that women were paid less  and the data shows that this is true  whether or not one can explain the reason if police used that logic they would never investigate murders because they cant explain how it happened therefore they cant be certain that it did happen,1,NOT
women chose to make less money got it,2,NOT
i agree with this but is it common sense that someone who works a reasonable expected amount of hours recieves less pay and chance of promotion than someone who works any shifts asked i know theyre being paid for extra work but some people want a stable life work balance maybe they have a family why should they be punished for doing the regular expected shift just interested in peoples opinions i dont know the answer myself so dont rant at me,1,NOT
i am sry but this video isnt abou facts u started well but if u come to the question why more men are in higher well payed positions u just say individuell carreer choices would be important to get some statistics about how many women tried to get the job or would work harderlonger or longer to get it,1,NOT
it doesnt matter some feminist wont listen to facts its pathetic glad you put a good truth to this stupid myth,2,NOT
telling the truth thats a moral from the bible get it,2,NOT
can we just repeal the th amendment already,5,ABU
yall can post whatever stuff you want that i dont agree with and i wont care but why does prager put these ads on shitpost videos i thought you could set the category of videos your ad appears on if so why not put them on political videos i just wanna watch a guy wake up his rabbit with an airhorn without having to deal with politics and the outside world for a bit,2,NOT
this is so stupid it makes my head hurt this is not how research is conducted god help this woman,3,NOT
common cents and sense some value the other more which one are you,2,NOT
wait a minutefacts dont belong in politics xd,2,NOT
say it enough times and eventually they will believe it adolf hitler,2,NOT
its just common sense,2,NOT
its fact liberals and feminist are fake masked people and mislead others,2,NOT
must be an accident that the professions that pay less are more female and vice versa cause early education that adds zero value to anyones life right compared to climate ruining extractive industries,2,NOT
the problem is that sexism keeps women out of the higher paying fields and positions and thus pushes them towards the lower paying majors,1,NOT
the left lies to advance their agenda,2,NOT
feminism and sjws will be the death of this world if not corruption of government which has already begun for a few years now,3,NOT
beause men are agressive enough to sue,3,NOT
to be fair its never simple there are certain industries where there very much is a gap in pay entertainment industries are notorious for this as are ceo positions but yes id agree the overly generalized idea of gender pay gap in all industries goes too far it depends on the individual cases,2,NOT
this is a subject my english teacher talks about at least  in  lessons and her only evidence is that she who is a teacher new this year gets paid less then the male english teacher who works here already since  years she also started the subject about an actress that is new got paid less then an already famous actor,2,NOT
facts dont care about your feelingsbenshapiro,2,NOT
i told a femenist that why dont companies hire only women and she said that there are is this true what should i say,2,NOT
someone should show this to swedish politician gudrun schyman,2,NOT
i agree that feminazis blow this stuff out or proportion and that the gender wage gap isnt what they say it is however this video is weak imo i want to love it i really do but the arguing here is a little weak  around  you say the small wage gap that does exist while having the title there is no gender wage gap  pick one  slide at  has the word may which completely destroys its value you can say anything may cause anything provided its not  false the slide is literally useless because of this  word,2,NOT
i do not think that people who perpetuate the wage gage myth do not like telling the truth but are to focused on creating a problem they do not research the information that is given,3,NOT
men are also more likely to ask for a raise,2,NOT
how could someone dislike the video its disliking facts classic liberals lol,2,NOT
damn that conclusion was so awesome ill keep it somewhere it will be handy ,2,NOT
how incompented can you be,3,NOT
can you provide links toy your sorsces next time please it would make it easier for me to study the stats if i needed to prove my point to people,1,NOT
as we are talking about common sense lets really use it about occupations and choices i have little to say of course it is about choice about a choice that is influenced by more than one varible by education which women had no opportunity to receive years ago and which in underdeveloped countries still dont receive and by society and stereotypes but acknowledging what you say and leaving this issue aside let me use common sense to answer the question you stated at the beggining why wont bussinesses hire all women simple answer what we call in spain el techo de cristal women just for the condition of being women are underrated just because of the fact that they may have a baby are under appreciated to the point where businesses wont hire them because they will have to leave due to their maternity and i am talking worldwide so please lets stop being a society that can see but is not looking lets stop ignoring the undeniable reality because women are still being considered as the weak gender and workplace is just a manifestation of it ohh and if you want to talk about facts just ask me,2,NOT
im posting this on facebook to see who wants me dead,2,NOT
she is womansplaining triggered,3,NOT
i do believe that there is no gender pay gap or at least none to the extent modern feminism describes it as but i do find some of the other shit prager u tries to convey a little bit bs and too conservative dont agree with everything they say because they strike home on one thing christina sommers is one of few sane feminists,2,NOT
its just common sense dammmmn,2,NOT
i would love to do this as a business communications presentation in class but then my professor would hate me,2,NOT
just a very small point you shouldnt say point seventyseven it is actually point seven seven seventy is seven times ten point seven is seven tenths mathematics grammar nerd signing off,1,NOT
what we all fail to realize is the possibility that women may not get these opportunitieswhether that be from being a stay at home mother or legitimate sexismdiscrimination or choicethe pay gap might just be an effective way to illustrate a bigger pointthat stuff appeals to voters and comes across as fact yet its notbut it gets the job done and is easierperhaps thats why politicians are citing it,1,NOT
this is the best video,2,NOT
wow thank you for opening my mind no joke when i clicked on this i said to myself ima gonna lose some brancells but you really explained it well and helped me understand thanks,1,NOT
i totally agree with this video,2,NOT
we learned this my senior year of college in marketing management management strategic operations marketing consumer behavior  management organization behaviors,1,NOT
i love you woman,1,NOT
i think this also lets two genders think different from different opportunities employment and by how much they all work although thats me ,2,NOT
facts with statistics,1,NOT
anyone noticed her red eyes what did u smoke,3,NOT
im  and there is so many feminazi s in my school i wish they would watch this video,2,NOT
there is no gender wage gap the gender wage gap is  cents ,2,NOT
i love her ,2,NOT
idk i have a friend that works at taco bell and she gets paid almost a dollar less an hour than the worst guy there and she does the best work,1,NOT
i remembered this video after i had to watch a video about gender equality that brought up the wage gap i have no idea why i had to watch that video though for my class the class has nothing to do with gender equality its a child development class i do love how you can get real statistics from prager university though,2,NOT
dumb liberal pieces of trash,3,NOT
the answer is not to put more women in those maledominated positions as chs pointed out that it comes down to personal preference but to either put more money into those femaledominated positions like social work or find a way to make those more profitable no easy task,1,NOT
modern feminism is regressive af,2,NOT
so there is its just that girls are conditioned to go into careers that we value less as a society and the small gap within careers has negotiating skills and self worth evaluation ability to factor in again conditioned by upbringing and society,1,NOT
wow the animation a  is really misleading  you represent en wage gap shrinking from  cents to  cents which is not the case its  cents to  cents you even mention the value later  if you want to mock people for their lack of math knowledge at least dont mess up a simple substraction i agree that more statistics knowledge and critical thinking toward statistical studies would be a good thing theres so many possibility to find the wrong answer even when being trying to be honest the choice of college field is also part of the problem as society tend to stir you toward or away from certain field depending on your gender,1,NOT
oh my god thank you i was so close to skipping this add when i heard the beginning but im glad i didnt,2,NOT
ha just sent to my sister this should really get her going great video,2,NOT
when my mom was working as a bank teller in collage there was also a male collage student working there who was the same age they did the exact same job worked the same hours and worked under the same manager but he made almost  more than she did could someone explain this,1,NOT
and the irony in all of this is people who fight to end inequalities in society whether or not theyre feminists tend to come from courses such as gender studies community organizing human studies and psychology meaning theyre more likely to be less scientifically literate im not saying that to mean feminists are dumb or dont want to put in the effort but analyzing and understanding quantitative data is almost by definition harder than coming up with speculative social theories and running with those,2,NOT
whilst true dont blatantly read off a teleprompter makes it look bs,3,NOT
wait but after you said you accounted for career choice hours and all that stuff you said there was still a  gap thats still a wage gap,1,NOT
the  dislikes are from people who watched until the part when she said the wage gap doesnt exist clicked and left lol,2,NOT
i think people are giving all feminist a bad rep i see a lot of people here who are saying things like all the feminist disliked this video haha and thats just putting all feminists in one group and saying theyre all the same but i i think i count as a feminist and i see this video and im just happy there isnt actually a wage gape they are the feminist extremes that ignore facts and begin to just be sexist towards men but obviously not everyone is like that,2,NOT
actually watched the whole add thanks for your work,2,NOT
women are less aggressive in negotiating their wages bam  cents,3,NOT
can i get link to that dept of labor paper,1,NOT
if this was narrated by a male so many more people would be mad,2,NOT
i agree with the video it makes great points but i have seen my friend be paid less than her male counterpart for the same job and she worked very hard so i do believe it does exist just not as much as it did,2,NOT
if women make the same amount of income as men why do companies insist on having you sign a nondisclosure of wages agreement,2,NOT
so linda aiken explanation of the gap wasnt an explanation it was a just a restate other than that great video i subscribed after watching a couple,2,NOT
 likes and i will post an original documentary on the wage gap,1,NOT
about  wankers watched this,3,NOT
my wife gets   of my pay,1,NOT
k dislikes by retarded feminists,3,NOT
so why dont women go for the highpaying university courses again oh right sexism please rethink saying the pay gap is unrelated to sexism,2,NOT
so by that logic  cents is a wage gap between men and women but its not a gender wage gap because you believe you can explain it otherwise where experts cannot heres the occams razor this is a gender wage gap,2,NOT
equal pay act of ,1,NOT
never before have i been so happy to see an ad d,1,NOT
women shouldnt even be allowed to work,5,ABU
women workers will not always be ready to be in the office when the firm needs them or work long hours without advanced notice because they simply have different responsibilities such as taking care of the household in addition individual career choices are often influenced by social environment and upbringing,5,ABU
a man who is a surgeon makes more than a walmart cashier who is a women oh my gosh that is oppression,3,NOT
i saw this as an add at first i never thought i would see the day good on them for getting this important info out there,2,NOT
this video provoked me so much the wege gap is  about sexism womendominated professions are lower paid than maledominating professions even in a scenario where both jobs requires a university degree and the same dedication and hours spent at work the thing about that men are willing to work more hours relocate etc depends only by the fact that they are not expected by society to take equal responsibility for children and household work women for example have far more parental days and are expected to stay at home when the child is sick for example  of course this will ultimately bring the woman less money this is not a choice it is a patriarchal structure,1,NOT
if women made less than men employers would only hire women,2,NOT
that doesnt change the fact that this is a problem we need to teach women to make the right choices,3,NOT
this was a pretty good video tbh im still skeptic on both sides but this was well presented though i wish your sources were there also it does seem dodgy that theres still a  gap obviously most of this can probably be explained but i worry for the poor souls whore paid less purely for things like agegenderrace etc,2,NOT
im just a high school kid you makes youtube videos on gaming i saw this video as an ad and was about to hit skip but man it was so factual and mind blowing that i had to find the actual video and give it a like i was raised to believe the wage gap myth but now your video has shed light on me and brought me into a new perspective on economics i wouldnt have ever been taught that information in school and for whatever reason i was interested in hearing more as she went on nice content i wont sub because its not my style on youtube but its nice to know that theres very interesting things on youtube other than the content i normally digest thanks,2,NOT
why is there any gap at all no one knows i do women as a whole arent as productive in any given workweek hourlong bathroom breaks for bloating  menstruation moments product replacement touching up makeup postpartuming crying all these thing keep them away from their work more work equals more advancement which equals more compensation then theres the maternity thing women who have been conditioned to believe they can have it all  a career and raise a family  will take considerably more time off after a baby is born come in late leave early twohour lunches all of these keep them away from their work,5,ABU
the factual feminist comes at prageru facts always beat lies always and a factual person beat a liying person,2,NOT
i like that it was a woman narrerating this video it makes the message stronger,2,NOT
who just went straight to the comments to see feminists rage,2,NOT
in short business ethic means make as much money as you can those without will earn less it isnt about gender discrimination,2,NOT
but i the point is women arent getting into as well paid jobs as men on average not that them doing the exact same job gets less money,1,NOT
 thousand people are feminazis,3,NOT
darn it there goes my plan of starting a business that only hires women to minimize upkeep by a huge amount,3,NOT
its no coincedence that the highest paying university degrees with the most men are some of the most sexist fields you could work in this is an incredibly devisive video,2,NOT
this is clickbait at the end of the video she still admitted that there was a wage gap lol,2,NOT
god bless this woman,2,NOT
k ideologues disliked this video because individualism bad,3,NOT
yup leftists are bad at math,2,NOT
seems like garbage,3,NOT
perhaps the remaining  can be explained by the fact that women tend to enter the workforce later than men and interrupt their careers for long periods of time to raise a family,3,NOT
voice is really nice and easy to listen to,1,NOT
kinda makes sense with how starting a family works a man comes and goes back to work women must wait m,3,NOT
 what you mean no study can cover them all a scientific experiment can eliminate many variables for example there is study that can cover them all there are experiment that let hr evaluate identical resumes of either having a male or female name the resume with male name usually have a higher income or acceptance rate,1,NOT
i explained to my cousins they dont even want to listen,2,NOT
how hard could it be to have an apples to apples comparison base pay rate comparison of same profession of same company male vs female,1,NOT

sorry but you forgot a main reason women work less hours and earn less because of it theyre expected to be the parent who stays with the children while the men are expected to work fully because theyre the breadwinner there are both men and women who want this to change there are men who want to be more present at home but cant find a job who provide them that and because of that the women have to stay with the children or else when men and women will be expected to be a parent and a worker equally then it will be changed,3,NOT
may i see your sores,3,NOT
soon the feminists will demand to remove the founding fathers in school curriculum and text books while the homosexuals will raises questions if the founders were really fathers and demand to call it just founders for the sake of gender equality,3,NOT
no i am so sexist i am willing to spend  more on wage just to hire mens despite there are equally qualified and capable woman out there lol,3,NOT
yes yes yes,2,NOT
i had a discussion with my world geography teacher and pleased to see that he was enjoying the convo and had points that stood out as well im all for equality and would love to speak about more politics then anything,1,NOT

feminism is the  kicking of the cornerstone on the pyramid on manhood and this video really illustrates this,3,NOT
this is the crappiest youtube channel ive ever seen behold im your new liberal troll,2,NOT
exactly by saying that men earn  to  is basically saying that men work harder so they earn more females chose different paths and as a result get lesser pay,2,NOT
 years later and we are still talking about this,1,NOT
sothe argument really is that women want the same wage as a petro engineer while being a social worker,3,NOT
also dont forget different employers pay differently,2,NOT
i dont want to look weird but in the end the man and the woman are part of the same body you cant do with a leg what you can do with hand and vice versa sometimes its possible but generally if not always one is more efficient than the other depending the case i do not like stereotypes but maybe unconsciously for example a man is stronger physical than a woman however a woman is better when there its about communications anyway i believe that maybe it would be a good idea for everybody if we tried to make a better use of our qualities than trying to balance everything,1,NOT
 you forgot to take out the man at the bottom right,2,NOT
you could also revert the first question why would businesses pay men more than women rather than pay why not put them just as low,2,NOT
in an earlier video named war on boys from prageru christina hoff said that boys are lacking behind girls in academics and we need to change the system girls make the choice to study while boys dont as much in this video she says women have lower wages because of their choice of job and its completely okay it shows why prageru is one of the most biased youtube channels,2,NOT
youre full of shit,5,ABU
the only place where there is a legitimate wage gap is porn women make approximately  times more than men,2,NOT
it is illegal for employers to discriminate based on sex,1,NOT
 micdrop of the century,2,NOT
this isnt enough proof to say that there isnt a wage gapbut there also isnt proof to say there is a wage gap between genders there are also other factors like the proportion of boy and girls a college accepts this isnt always   on both sides either at this point both sides are dumb,2,NOT
here is a challenge for people who believe in the gender pay gap find me a man and a woman whos salaries differ when they both work in the same industry for the same company and perform the same role as well as work the same hours have the same experience qualifications and education while being the same age dont worry ill be waiting,3,NOT
when the problem is individual choice then there is no problem,2,NOT
my female high school ap statistics teacher once and a couple other times told us its not men who oppress women in the workplace but other women women are so jealouscompetitive with each other that they would bring down other women so that they can get ahead its an interesting thought to say the least of course im not generalizing for the entire population but its another perspective to consider,2,NOT
were the scientists who composed this wage gap study undergrads or something,3,NOT
as a liberalsocialist i have to say that this video completely changed my opinion on the gender wage gap while i still think that a certain degree of sexism might be involved ie some stem jobs are seen as maleonly jobs reducing the number of female graduates i admit that i was wrong,2,NOT
i love this lady so much,1,NOT
feminists nowadays man,2,NOT
so the conflict between the left and the right is the cause of a misunderstanding thats shite,3,NOT
just wanted to thank anyone responsible for getting this circulated into the ads on you tube  i happened to be watching skeptic videos but i hope its not just limited to appear in that content because itll never be seen by those that need to see it if thats the case,2,NOT
just shown this video to my feminist mother she stopped the video after  seconds claiming that its propaganda,2,NOT
k dislikes i see how many feminists have watched this video,3,NOT
the left treat facts like kryptonite this is a great video i cant help but feel sorrow in the fact that because this video is so strong in facts it makes it stronger to be rejected because leftists treat facts and truth like repellant,2,NOT
tryna find a feminist complaining in the comments,2,NOT
love this shit,2,NOT
theres one more important point here the cost of employment over a year career who takes more days off whos more likely to need a long leave of absence who does the school call when they need a parent for a sick child i think if you threw in this factor you would find that  gap,2,NOT
god bless this video,2,NOT
anytime it comes to pragueu i just watch the ad to the end,2,NOT
lol    i love outrage culture someone is watching this losing their mind in anger despite the truth,2,NOT
pragu university where the chunky meatball marinara is made,2,NOT
respect for the fact that this comes from a woman,2,NOT
i love prageru videos,2,NOT
being rational is sexists behavior,3,NOT
 triggered feminists,3,NOT
i actually liked this video but using a click bait title like there is no pay gap then saying its only  is kinda contradictory atleast in my view,2,NOT
the wage gap is that men dont cost as much to employ as women and there is no wage gap feminazis just hate men,3,NOT
wow you disproved this strawman that totally hadnt been destroyed earlier by anyone else why do women have worse occupations positions education and work less hours gender roles,2,NOT
prageru is complete garbage,3,NOT
for wage gap career choices and educational differences explain most if not all the gender gap in nursing and most of the other professions politicians play the wage gap cards by lying not truth,2,NOT
thats right all those male ceos who earn billions have done so on the backs of underpaid women who wiped their butts in pre k,3,NOT
also there is that little thing called equal pay act of ,2,NOT
this needs to be played on national television,2,NOT
say anything with gumption and theyll believe you,2,NOT
if a woman does the same job as a man and works for the same amount of huors the woman vill earn less then the man most of the time do you really think that obama talked alot about the wage gap just by divading men and womans average sallery,2,NOT
im in love with this woman,2,NOT
nope too much logic,3,NOT
even the incorrectly calculated wage gap is closing fast way more women go to college than men and women are getting married and having kids later and later every year to focus on their careers more the truth is business was extremely unfriendly to women like  years ago and its been getting progressively better since then one day women will probably make more than guys do the way the education system is going but these things take time they dont happen overnight,2,NOT
the reason this question is much more controversial than it should be is because of this is there a gender gap yes this is a  undeniable truth and we have the statistics to back it up men do earn more than women this is the reality but the controversy is not about the fact that it exists  but the reason to it and as the video clearly states this gap exist more due to the career choices men and women make than an evil men conspiracy there will always be a gender gap and sometimes it will swing in one way and sometimes another because we are all individuals are women stupid for choosing a career they enjoy no women tend to work to live while men tend to live to work and that makes the women far more intelligent in my book that said would love to see more women in my field embedded programming ,2,NOT
does anyone have sources,1,NOT
can you please translate this to greek i want to show it to my classmates,2,NOT
why do female fashion models earn much more than male models is that reverse sexism the clothingfashionhairmakeupfragrance industries are obviously able to get a higher return on famous female models appearing in their marketing materials,3,NOT
finally the truth about the perceived wage gap,2,NOT
you make what you earn not sure of an occupation that guys couldnt focus on that isnt male dominated that men if ok by society couldnt pgwn but i cant think of one that women could own for just being women but yet many jobs men could do and own women such at it if men do it name one you cunts name one job men cant do better than yu,5,ABU
so funny about all these rah rah comments  none of you all give a sht that women earn so little youre like who cares if their full time jobs dont earn sht its their choice to teach our kids maybe get shot wipe our grandpas butts help get the homeless drug treatment  shelter stay home a while with a mans children suckers are your values all about the market,2,NOT
gender wage gap but  i thought gender dosent exist isnt gender a social construct lolcant make this shit up,3,NOT
one of the only ads on youtube that i actually did not skip,2,NOT
lets say i own a business i know hiring is an imperfect science and that i will invariably hire employees who arent right for the job the fact that i might be sued for being racist or sexist if i hire a black person or a woman is going to make me only hire white guys not because i am racist or sexist but because those are the only employees who i can easily fire if they arent doing a good job has anyone ever thought how affirmative action and special protections for certain groups ends up helping white guys wouldnt it be better to simply have equal opportunity,2,NOT
what clarity thank you,2,NOT
its just common sense dont you mean common cents drops mic,1,NOT
english and history teachers are brainwashing my classmates with this wage gap propaganda,2,NOT
so why is there a vox video in my recommended category when watching this video are the bad feminists that insecure,3,NOT
dont you feel ashamed to say this as a woman,2,NOT
adopt me please based mom,2,NOT
my sociology teacher was spewing bs about the wage gap saying women with a better degree and better experience wont get paid as much as men just because they are female i hit her with the why would companies not hire only women she literally had no response and all the girls and beta males who were agreeing with her couldnt argue i went on to explain into further detail and they all just sat there and then said oh you may be right i never thought of that,2,NOT
the  cents gap can also relate to maternity leave from the job the wage gap is that a myth it was outlawed in ,2,NOT
yes im a feminist and i realise that the wage gap is highly exaggerated in the us and other firstworld countries but that doesnt mean that feminism is bad perhaps the extremists but not at the core of it or that gender inequality has been fixed developing countries have a huge gender inequality in literacy schoolingeducation work and relationships there has been so much progress made by the movement which is why we should keep the name feminism to respect and acknowledge the history and achievements made by some incredible people and groups but theres still so much progress to be made please dont harass people who use the word feminism or people who dont get all their facts right harassment does not educate people or allow for conversation can we instead be openminded kind and ready for compassionate discussion,1,NOT
i checked aauw website there is lots of articles about pay gap but how will i find data that is mentioned on ,1,NOT
it makes it more believable when a woman is saying this stuff,2,NOT
im glad that was clarified,2,NOT
so nice to see something based on facts and not on the media lying to us and spreading rumours there is some hope in this world,2,NOT
so the case is that the entire concept of a gender wagegap was established from a misinterpretation of a statistic regaring average salary of men and women and some people came to the conclusion that this difference in average salary must be because of discrimination when its really because of differences between how males and females thinkchoose men on average tend to go for the higherpaying jobs and work longer very interesting,3,NOT
this is a very misleading video and clearly has a lot of the people in the comments confused first off the title of this video is clearly wrong within the video it states that there is a wage gap but that it is produced by choice from this position you must then ask why women are choosing lower paid jobs there are multiple answers to this firstly the patriarchal society in which we live has tended to pay male dominated industries more this is not necessarily because these industries are of more value it is due to unions and wage debates over decades secondly women are told from a young age that they will be a nurse teacher or any other female dominated industry this is through all kinds of life also the idea that women should be the ones looking after a child are outdated this is a joint task for both parents,1,NOT
this is such a great video you can not argue facts,2,NOT
seems like a defeatist mindset then theres all of those magical variables no one can define in the end the gap still exists either way which defeats the supposed premise of the video this one seems odd,2,NOT
pharmaceutical sales aka pretty women selling men boner pills,3,NOT
so the gender wage gap does exist but there are many variables and no apparent reason why,2,NOT
as the video demonstrated the wage gap does exist and is driven by the society valuing male dominated professions more as a business owner i do find that women often times agree to the lower salary compared to men,2,NOT
yes this video is totally accurate and i agree with the whole idea but people saying that her first statement already destroys the myth does not make a lot of sense companies have a general idea that women arent as valuable so they arent hired as much,2,NOT
because salaries are negotiated god damn that why dont businesses only hire women is so tired the issue is positions and occupations as well if you dont actually understand the issue maybe not talk about it and if there is no gap then a law requiring no gap would do nothing so its a win win and if you argue against a winwin situation than that means you want someone to lose,2,NOT
based mom is all warrior,2,NOT
lying with pictures example  the gap doesnt go from  to  cents it goes from  to  cents why do they do that dont they have a strong case anyway,2,NOT
a sincere thank you for addressing this its a kick in the goods to pseudo bias research the like of which should be utterly destroyed with fire and hatred,2,NOT
ive long believe that this is a myth which is backed up by feelings rather than hard facts strange also that even when studies have shown cases where on a like for like basis women were earning more than men the psychotic feminists would still keep on habit i guess whining about women earning less than men oh and while were on the subject how did the men ever allow the women in tennis to be paid the same as them for about  the work,3,NOT
this makes some sense,2,NOT
id fuckthe shit outta that grandma,6,ABU
in my sociology class we were talking about gender inequality and my professor brought up the wage gap i asked why wouldnt businesses hire women in order for them to pay less and make more profit he answered in some bs that people at the top are sexist and thats the reason why all i ask for is one conservative professor just one,2,NOT
you already made a video where you tell us that the wage gap is a myth do something newspeak about death penaltyyou already made a video about judeochristian valuesso i want to see if you will say the same things or say things that contradict it,2,NOT
thank you if have been talking to people about the wage gap many times most people either say  or much more than it actually is finally someone actually got i right though saying that the wage gap is a myth is not true since its still ,2,NOT
im always blown away by this narrative liberals think that capitalism is so greedy if so wouldnt capitalist businesses hire the cheapest wage liberalism sjw feminism and so forth a complete lack of knowledge facts and most importantly logic oh thats right according to feminist logic is now deemed as sexist,2,NOT
   already destroyed all the haters,2,NOT
in my opinion i think you made your title wrong it should have been women are not being paid less because they are women there is a gap with male and female annual salaries is it unfair no there are many reasons women make less than men and it has nothing to do with them being simply women from being a women yes,1,NOT
women make it up in divorce and child custody,3,NOT
so your saying,2,NOT
so men get paid an extra  cents to do dangerous work not much compensation,3,NOT
facts dont care about your feelings god ,2,NOT
christina hoff sommers is a badass,2,NOT
everyone needs to see this,2,NOT
psychology is one of d worst paying major is this true,1,NOT
finally something to show my feminist english teacher,2,NOT
and all these dudes and celebs go around thinking theyre changing the world and ignore this wage gap grow up stop tryna make it all about u its not even real,2,NOT
realistically feminists are just going to forget about every fact stated in this video and go back to screaming like headless chickens in their lame ass parades,3,NOT
sadly i personally know a few women which despite being presented with facts will put their feet down and sustain the rhetoric of the wage gap and the malecentric job market,2,NOT
i need prager u after ethnic studies,2,NOT
anyone who passed math in th grade should understand this,2,NOT
this was an add on a video i was watching thank youyoutube,2,NOT
well produced and fact orientated video which means there is too much logic for the people using the argument on the fist place im guessing you lose them about min and half into the video why bother thinking about the arguments presented in this video when you can simplify it to different outcome unfair,3,NOT
ugly fat redhead feminists disliked this video,3,NOT
well aerospace engineers get paid too much in comparison you see preschool teachers should get the same see how that works,2,NOT
the wage gap has been debunked time and time again and yet people still think it exists i just dont get it,2,NOT
so women can work  nights and make six figures in las vegas and strippers or what about getting tipswomen get much better tips then men and in vegas makes thousands in a night or twowhat about adult moviesthere are many things women make huge money that men cant make do you think they add this when they make wage gap claims,2,NOT
if woman made more than men nobody would complain about the wage gap,2,NOT
this video makes a great job at explaing evrything that feminists are to stupid to understand in a very clear way,3,NOT
there is no money,1,NOT
there is  difference that cannot be explained according to swedish studies atleast in sweden,2,NOT
my mum works longer than my dad and she earns more gender injustice,3,NOT
this is just a terribly argued piece of propaganda its too bad only conservative organizations like mr pragers have money to run these desperate youtube adds,2,NOT
how is this not common sense,2,NOT
this video contradicts its own title,2,NOT
liked before watching,2,NOT
thank you for educating me,2,NOT
the wage gap is caused by women women dont go for higher jobs so they dont get as much money so a women complaining about a wage gap is hypocritical,2,NOT
the question now is why do woman go to the worst jobs this question isnt over,2,NOT
why do men and women make different career choices whyyy is it so hard to ask yourself this question,2,NOT
 i think what you mean is that instade of a  cents gap we have a  cents gap then you shouldnt show this bar going from  to  but form  to ,1,NOT
i want to make an essay about this but i need the sources for your numbers and facts,1,NOT
preach why dont the women complaining about the wage gap drop their jobs as school teachers and actually work for something such as an engineer as a woman my whole life ive always wanted to become a chemical or computer engineer and i am making it a reality through dedication and making it into a great engineering school women cant complain about the wage gap if they arent going to work important jobs,2,NOT
i love this video  i will watch this video every day now ,2,NOT
well done for giving women a voice that will gain them genuine respect,2,NOT
but muh wage gap,2,NOT
i didnt even know i thought the wage gap was a real thing thanks for this educational video,2,NOT
this is all true kudos to you and to my rhyme ,2,NOT
so this video claims the opposite of what others claim so which one is real,1,NOT
the reason why women do not choose to work more is because they mostly take care of their children this difference comes from unfair distribution of housechores and child care between wife and husband,1,NOT
wait isnt this the same channel that thinks climate change is a hoax,2,NOT
this really opened my eyes thanks for sharing this information,2,NOT
its gonna piss feminists off that a woman made this video,2,NOT
one thousand social justice warriors dislike this,2,NOT
as a male nurse i can attest that nursing is mostly made of women more than  but nurse anesthesia is almost  this is tru for icu nursing where nurses are paid more and night shift work travel work etc there is no way in hell women in nursing are making less for the same job,2,NOT
if i had a dollar for everytime i could show this video to a feminist a woman wouldve made  cents,2,NOT
despite the actually narrow wage gap between men and women in western industrial societies there is still a tendency of women to call on traditional female privileges where in marriage the male was the sole breadwinner when they say to their spouses whats mine is mine and whats yours is ours it makes a man want to go mgtow men going their own way i could make an exception as christina hoff sommers would make an interesting date,2,NOT
i wasnt buying this either but this video cleared everything up for me,2,NOT
she didnt talk about the reason why women go into lesser paying jobs why do women choose these less paying jobs why dont more women choose higher paying jobs women want to work regular hours because they are usually caring for childrenthey have families its not that they need to get to work though i am compelled by the no wage gap argument there is still a stigma though less prominent than it has been about where a woman should be placed in society,1,NOT
real good video i almost thought ben shapiro wrote the script,3,NOT
okay so you normalize for job title and years of experience but thats the problem men are much more likely to have roles in management and high paying job titles than women women are burdened with having to take care of children and work a fulltime job at the same time while the majority of men can just focus solely on their career and be home just in time for dinner to be ready while not contributing much else to the household and i could bet you that my male coworker who has worked there less than i have gets paid more just because he has a masters degree next to his name and because hes a male even though i have much more work experience in total than he does because our indian boss comes from a culture where there is a huge bias of gender and education title,2,NOT
great class  beautiful voice,2,NOT
money shouldnt exist full stop full communism is the future,3,NOT
how the eff can you say there is no wage gap and then say the actual wage gap wtf  and how why cant we focus more on putting more women in stem fields,2,NOT
my mother cant except that the wage gap or the glass ceiling doesnt exist she thinks that women still get paid much less then men,2,NOT
i came here to see if there are any rage quitting feminists,2,NOT
how would one go about researching the wage gap myth what are key words to search for other than wage gap,1,NOT
even as a liberal i knew this was true you dont have to do much research to figure this out,2,NOT
in my job as an executive director of a nonprofit we pay men and women equally but women end up making less because they take more time off exceeding what we allow which means they arent paid for it a couple women scream equal pay for equal work but i remind them that also means equal work for equal pay if they arent there to work they wont get paid for it unfortunately for women women take time off not only when they are sick but also when family members are sick or when someone in the family has a school consultation or school play or drs or dentists appointment one woman in the office would leave every day at pm an hour before everyone else because the bus would drop her kids off at school at that time when she complained about me docking her pay for that i explained that why would it be fair for me to pay her that hour when the others in the office were actually working to be paid i had suggested that she not take a lunch or come in early but those didnt work for her either i felt like she was lucky i let her go home early every day she felt like i was robbing her,2,NOT
to funny mens hours are mostly logic based womens choices seem mostly emotional or irrational but men are the immature ones hahaha,3,NOT
if after factoring in choice the wagegap shrinks to only  cents for every dollar that means that choice isnt responsible for a small wagegap the  cents dollar is the result after accounting for choice this means that women are paid less on average some women are likely paid significantly less than male peers working the same jobs while in other companies women are on par with their coworkers yes a large component of the lager wage gap  cents for every dollar is due to job choice however it does not fully account for the wage gap and  cents to every dollar is still a significant gap,2,NOT
i remember when my school in england did an assembly about a wage gap its good that most of my friends laughed at it because how they are trying to brainwash us into being anti trump leftist lgbt libtards,2,NOT
i want to see another video from chs that explains finally why are feminists unable to comprehend this logic and common sense,3,NOT
this is the one video that makes sense on this channel the majority of the content on this channel has a strange culty vibe,2,NOT
okay ill honest here i thought there was a gender gap in wages but never dug into the matter as im only a student yet and it wasnt a present issue for me i did suspect there was some bias in the mens one dollar womens  cents statement and im glad i found this video because it confirmed my suspect and changed my overall opinion on the whole gender wage gap matter ill dig into this more i just hope this video and her university are valid sources,2,NOT
its a gender earnings gap most women earn less money than men but that doesnt fit the feminazi narrative so theyll just ignore it,2,NOT
lady you forgot to mention how women still lag behind their male coworkers by  rather than  after controlling for age education and years of experience and theres a  difference in total pay between men and women also when you separate income data by occupation the gender wage gap becomes even clearer the biggest gender wage gaps due to occupational segregation are seen in jobs located in business finance law and healthcare occupations that are primarily self employed such as chiropractors the smallest wage gaps are seen in technology and science industries and healthcare positions with a small degree of selfemployment like pharmacists,2,NOT
yes there is it is simple math,2,NOT
very well done thank you,2,NOT
warning this channel spreads climate skeptism and denial this is no university channel but a fraud the founder of this channel dennis prager is a religious fundamentalist and a republican politician in us clearly this man wants to spread the hatred of other religions misinformation against gender equality and basic climate science i have no doubt that this channel is funded by big corporations to spread lies and misinformation in people and thus make them weaker against their interests please do not share or spread the videos posted by this channel,2,NOT
nothing feels better than triggering feminists its the new hilarious pastime,3,NOT
wait this pargeru video has evidence fats and sound logic if more of their videos were like this i would actually take them seriously,2,NOT
the wage gap goes away whenyou get married think about it,2,NOT
 feminists are now angry and are still sticking fingers in their ears and closing their eyes while screaming on the floor like a  year old,3,NOT
where are the feminist comments guess they cant argue facts,3,NOT
did they consider benefits in with earnings too,1,NOT
why dont youtube put prager u videos on top trending but keep promoting leftist hysterical nonsense,2,NOT
this video actually states that the gender wage gap does exist it just says its ok it really annoys me when people dont understand that gender wage gap just means women on average get paid less than men not women who work at the same position as a man get paid less then men,1,NOT
thank you we needed this video a long time ago,2,NOT
but muh communism but muh hillary but muh feminism but muh emotions facts make leftists sad,3,NOT
the point is getting women to be able to enter stem subjects because of sexism theyre rarely interested in it,2,NOT
because if businesses only hired women men would sue,2,NOT
these prager u vids are an enigma to me one can be a thoughtful factbased argument there is no gender wage gap war on boys feminism  and the next can be an unfactual highlyopinionated rant dangerous people are teaching your kids everyone should stand for the national anthem you guys definitely keep me guessing if nothing else,2,NOT
its a choice that men and women both make on call  missing out on a lot in life dangerous work environment  high risk of death or serious injury work long and late hours  sacrificing time with loved ones and personal time for yourself no disrespect to women but  of them are not willing to do any of that but will complain their not getting paid as much as the person who is men dont do it because its fun we do it because someone has to if you was a employer and had a employee working late hours on a short notice willing to be on call willing to come in on their days off willing to relocate and go out on dangerous work environments wouldnt you want to pay them a bit more then the person who isnt willing to do any of that,3,NOT
its odd that you never hear anyone ever talk about the fact that in the porn industry women actors are paid about ten times as much as men actors for doing the same job,2,NOT
i do not care what the job huge salaries need raining in there are not enough hours in a day for any human being to genuinely earn hundreds of thousands of pounds in a salary its just greed to make them richer that the rest who are probably working ten times harder for a very very lot less,2,NOT
i totally agree with u,2,NOT
can we all agree this is the best youtube ad we were all forced to watch,2,NOT
man earns  dollar female wtf i only earned  cents child you guys are getting paid for work,3,NOT
an interesting problem is leaving the west eg latin america what about the wage gap here i saw ads for a job that stated the monthly income and it was different for manwoman yes they had  salary values i filled out myself a salary calculator and finally switched from male to female and rerun it the result was significant lower,2,NOT
they do not hire only women for the same reason they pay women less than men sexism and prejudice they think that even with paying less for a female employee it would not be worth it they do not hire as many women to high positions because they think among other things than the underlings will not respect the authority of women or that women do not do as good of a job,2,NOT
   sexism maybe    alright    so theres some bias right there you made the bar say  cents when it should have said  cents or you could have made the bar say  cents and then say  cents im willing to forgive it but bias is something one shouldnt forget about    thats one way to interpret it there is the idea that certain jobs are paid less because they are traditionally female and because women tend to gravitate towards them   may be thats the key term in that sentence    see this is where the interesting part is do those jobs pay less because theyre traditionally female the one job where women dominate men the second highest paying one i mean is still traditionally considered a male dominated job perhaps the pay for these jobs is low becuse theyre traditionally female  okay so men are overrepresented in dangerous jobs but women are overrepresented in jobs which help the social classes and keep the country turning and people in need happy men are overrepresented in business jobs which pay too much and contribute little enough to society that if a few went out of business it wouldnt really effect most people in a major way women should be paid more for jobs like pshychology education human services and social work which is essential to our society,2,NOT
naomi if you see this comment then i want you to know that i am always right therefore i wasnt wrong about wage gap,2,NOT
in my government and economics class i have a friend who is a feminist whenever she talks about the wage gap topic she brings up the fact that her mom who was a doctor was payed less than other doctors in the same field i dont remember what kind of doctor she was i just couldnt agree with her with this example as her evidence i knew for a fact that there were way to many factors that went into an individuals pay for the reasoning to just be women arent being treated equally im sure there are other true examples of inequality but they must be very rare and small cases that are also probably resolved quickly i dont see why people have to assume all the statistics correlate or have anything to do with each other they just show whats happening not how its happening,2,NOT
there probably is a gender wage gap but i dont think its a problem im sure it just happened to be this way and in a few years itll go the other way,2,NOT
the    difference can partially be explained by actual sexist small business owners who deliberately pay women less these would be few in number but nevertheless it gets counted when you look at averages,2,NOT
you forgot about the wage gap between bunnies and humans,3,NOT
finally somebody admits it,2,NOT
i agree with most of the stuff you said in the video but what if there was a huge wage gap on woman on a jobmy good friends mother is working full time as a journalist and is writing news paper for a work time of  hours a day i dont remember the paycheck that she needed to make but lets just say by working  hours she is going to make kshe is working like crazy for hours and she should make k right well right but the problem is her boss  from k she is getting payed a lot less than she should about  she is scared do ask her boss the reason that she gets a low payment because is a little bit hard to find a job in that city i dont know if her boss is sexist or an asshole or even both but that is a huge wage gap and indeed is happening in some reare casesi dont disagree with the video i just want to say that this happens some times and i got as a explaination my friends mother that is based on a reall story oh and sorry for my english ,2,NOT
i really want to show this to my teacher in school hes always talking about women being payed less and im tired of it,2,NOT
this video made me subscribe,2,NOT
 triggered feminists disliked this video,3,NOT
its not just common sense but also reality,2,NOT
its just a bandwagon for career politicians and militant feminists to leap on to,2,NOT
wwwhat miss you do know your not meant to say this your a female your meant to hate men,3,NOT
this is the truth when are feminists going to get common sense one other thing why does the left talk about the gender wage gap so much and then pretend there is no difference between genders when it comes to the lgbt agenda hypocrisy,3,NOT
theres a clever linguistics trick at around  she says the wage gap shrinks when we account for choice and then says the remaining  is due to choice that doesnt actually logically follow and the fact that such a blatant error made it through scripting performing and editing says that it was likely deliberate,2,NOT
 k feminist got b triggered by the truth,3,NOT
finally im not the only one who thinks the same,2,NOT
stick to this stuff you made some excellent points religion not your strength,2,NOT
i can say there is hello im liliyanna im transgender and im a welder when i was male i was payed  hr as a woman i was offed  hr max  this is the same job,2,NOT
coming from a libtard here as i know republicans call us good video wage gap is almost  a myth i would have liked to see an example of a specific job that a man and a woman share and their wages to solidify the argument but ill just assume that thats where the  comes from i do have an issue with the tone of the video though i get that pragerus audience is more republican and conservative but the aggressive tone and use of wordsphrases like myth and sexists dont have their math right are just unnecessary rude and alienate half of your potential audience the people who you might want to convince that they dont have their facts exactly right the numbers dont lie in this case economics is clearly more complicated than businesses pay them less because theyre women but an aggressive tone does more harm than good,2,NOT
ooh this is gonna trigger so many feminists,3,NOT
 men are expected to die in a work related accident each year but we dont care about that now do we lol,2,NOT
i liked this video a month ago i came back today and found i had disliked it any answers youtube,1,NOT
i went out of my way just to click this ad and thumbs up the video,2,NOT
i like that its a women debunking this myth,2,NOT
im a leftist and i agree the gender wage gap is a myth ever since  its been against the law to pay someone less because of their race or gender,2,NOT
obama got away with this pandering lie because fake news doesnt care about truth,5,ABU
hum sooo how it comes that every woman i know are less payed than men for the same job  that means same task hours education etc,2,NOT
now their argument is going to be woman are oppressed into choosing lower paying jobs because men are scary,3,NOT
give woman right they said itd be fun they said,5,ABU
its cos women are pushed towards low paying jobs this is what my teacher says i dont think she likes ys,2,NOT
if feminists took economics instead of gender studies maybe theyd know this,2,NOT
show this to a feminist and they will be likeyeah im sure they hold this woman hostage until she read the entire script of the video,3,NOT
i will be the one to take loads of insults and thumbs downs on this but prager should not be using such an absolute title for this video their arguments are correct yes the popular  cents per dollar mantra is the result of statistical illiteracy but they are not addressing the fact that a wage gap indeed exists and can be shrunken by some means for example we could encourage women to pursue the hard sciences encourage better wage and salary negotiation and promote better work ethic saying that a small gap exists and is thus irrelevant is nonsense i expect better from prager,2,NOT
how can there be a gender wage gap if gender is a social construct,3,NOT
could you point me to where you found the aauw brought the gape down to  im searching but i cannot find it,1,NOT
exactly and choices are made of totally free will hahahahahaha common woman do not take more responsabilities to clean at home or be with kids for example that takes their time for choosing more proffessional development why is this for free choice hahahahaa i had to totally quit my job as a university teacher because i choosed to have kids a man can both have the job and the family it is true than we choose but it isnt a free choice its a social impossed one because of a gender gap watch the video of eh about the dream gap it also have to do with that i get sad that a woman is making this video,2,NOT
the only ad i liked that i was forced to watch on youtube,2,NOT
wow its almost as if prageru is saying the exact same things as feminist theorists men are socially conditioned into higher paying work for no apparent reason ahhaha,3,NOT
so many people butt hurt because of a  minute youtube video,2,NOT
listen to the distant screeches of the special snowflakes as they sprint here as fast as their chubby legs can carry them,3,NOT
i didnt know people still believed this myth,2,NOT
the womansplaining is so strong on this video,3,NOT
yes those calculations dont show education work or choice but there is data including those factors the gender wage gap does exist and i have overwhelming data to prove it go to the economic policy institute,1,NOT
im a leftie but i do agree with this,2,NOT
brilliant as always based mom,2,NOT
why celebs are not making noise on the homeless issue  why,2,NOT
i think prager university should change its name to hard facts university melt all the little snowflakes into a puddle,3,NOT
when will people learn,2,NOT
heeeeerrrrrressss the triggered,3,NOT
im no feminist but if you are going to present a proper argument you cant repeatedly twist facts with vague statements why dont businesses hire only woman because when i hire someone for a job there are literally  years worth of discrimination laws that prevent me from making my decision based on gender oh and your reproductive sex is not listed under qualifications  they dont take into account occupation no they only take into account literally all occupations held by botheither genders making it abundantly nonbias position are you reflecting on men holding higher payed positions illustrating a genderbased inequality because it sounds like you did  education people who attend a university will make on average  million dollars more over  years and there are more woman than there are men in college so logically shouldnt education result in woman making more hours per week we literally just heard you mention both parties working fulltime rendering that irrelevant to the statistic ,1,NOT
didnt you already make this video,2,NOT
holy shit you cant be serious,2,NOT
thats the thing about common sense its not as common as you might think,2,NOT
men make more money because men care more about making money this isnt rocket science anyone that cant see this must be willfully ignorant men are not more materialistic but they absolutely care more about how much money they make and guess what thats fair the person that cares more and tries harder as a result should do better i know we love this idea of the mary sue characters like ray from star wars no practice no effort just instantly a master of whatever she tries to do thats not real life unfortunately the person that tries the hardest usually wins men care more about making money so they try harder to make money because they try harder guess what every decision that they make will be influenced by the desire to make more money and in the end they will likely out earn women stop trying to prove that women are better than men its crazy annoying and it belies your inferiority complex,3,NOT
i feel like feminist are always mad wage gap or no they will be mad there is none,3,NOT
this is one of the best videos i have ever seen i love this university,2,NOT
i would say that the premise of this video is totally stupid but it isnt its purposefully deceptive shame,3,NOT
there is still a gender wage gap the video is very good the conclusion misses something however the bestpaying specialties often require flexible hours in business for instance a high paying career is one that requires you to have a lot of meetings outside of your  routine given that women tend have more commitments at home than men they are not as free to shape their lives around their work like men so are there less women in highpaying jobs because they consciously dislike highpaying jobs and prefer lowerpaying jobs no because we expect women to take care of the kids to make dinner to wash the clothes to take care of the house as a result men are more flexible than women as a result you wouldnt hire someone who cant be as commited and if you are expected to not be as commited you wont even consider these jobs this explains why in science and research careers for instance which dont require as much commitment outside of  hours women do just as well as men is it fair its a different debate in my opinion yes it is see ya,2,NOT
prageru seems to be the only right wing college out there,2,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense,3,NOT
i think its an issue that traditionally feminized and femaledominated fields like counselling nursing teaching are paid less than maledominated fields like engineering and tech why do we pay teachers and counselors less when those feilds are just as if not more essential to society as stem jobs,1,NOT
these calculations may not indicate a genderwage injustice as you said given that men are more likely to go into stem fields which pay more notwithstanding proving that these are poor ways to measure gender wage gap doesnt prove that there isnt a gender wag gap a better way to measure this would be compare hourly wages of men and women in the same profession and have been working the same number of years ,1,NOT
dude you shouldnt make videos like this this is a highly controversial topic and may make many feminists very upset,3,NOT
i think we should start looking into the intelligence gap for everyone you have to be stupid to believe in the gender wage gap there is no other explanation,3,NOT
ive always worked at places where payment was exactly the same for everybody in the same ocupation never actually understoodbelieved this gap everyone keep talking about i agree a hundred percent with the video career choices makes all the diference in this matter im from brazil and at least here a company simple cannot pay different values to employees who do exactly the same job for the same time in the same place,2,NOT
this woman is a genius,1,NOT
no wonder this video has almost  million views its true af,2,NOT
i appreciate the additional video on this topic it saddens me that its always falling on deaf ears as those who would benefit from learning the truth are just too willfully ignorant to take any opposing view into genuine consideration,2,NOT
do we know many menwomen apply to join each college are women rejected from some colleges and steered toward others or do women choose to focus more towards the social educationcareer ps im all for this just figured its a fair question,2,NOT
pleeeaaase react to pewdiepies new video,1,NOT

she went vegan for  days then made a video of her smacking chicken in her mouth like a cow and crying on her kitchen floor,3,NOT
not everyone can do it overnight i feel positive reinforcement when you do something good works better than punishment when you do something bad,1,NOT
thats amazing news,1,NOT
she just uploaded a mukbang though lmao i love trisha though shes hilarious with these ups and downs with diets,1,NOT
hey freelee just wondering if u could do a video on how to help anaemic people,1,NOT
shes not going vegan shes trying it for two weeks and i can guarantee she will cave before then it is never a last minute decision to make a lifestyle change and also never a healthy decision freelee is like that annoying jehovahs witness at your door or the person that leaves a business card for their church in your tip jar she thinks you can switch lifestyles at the drop of a dime and that is so unrealistic,5,ABU

trisha isnt even capable of being a vegetarian let alone a vegan,3,NOT
i couldnt live without meat and dairy,1,NOT
transgenders make me cringe,3,NOT
maybe they should compete against more advanced female athletes but i guess thats impossible its seems that they would always be a the top of the sport,3,NOT
what about a transgender league,3,NOT
funny how everyone is for it then this crap happens lol men are generally strongerfaster than femalesit is science not sexism,3,NOT
all those parnets just want there daughter on top instead of the transgender females,2,NOT
now its ok to mixanything goes as long the lower class stay low ,2,NOT
some of these girls want to win college athletic scholarships is it fair that a transgender female take away that opportunity if it continues to happen then wont most female athletics be transgender females we say we want to allow transgender females all the rights but where are the rights of the biological females,3,NOT
this reporter says that medical research cant really identify the line were a competitive advantage might exist for transgender athletes of either gender well that is a lie,3,NOT
wondering these are males who wear makeup and grow their hair long and act like a girl and bianca is not very bright winning metals is not something everyone can do so how your feel and winning a metal are completely different,5,ABU
if they started hormones its not a advantage they are taking hormones that will help them physically and mentally transform into young women i will never understand the disrespect of others people are just mad because they won im sure this wouldnt be a problem if they lost you want to win u have to practice stop being cry babies they are not men anymore they have started hormones to become a women theres no advantage and people need to face the facts u cant accept it quit the track team,1,NOT
what has the world come to men who think theyre women and its not their own fault cause its a mental disability the state is humoring this at the expense of the other real girls success,5,ABU
they can do what they want but not at the expense of the girls ,3,NOT
muh feelins  boy is this country fukd ,3,NOT
how is this an issue in the first place lol,3,NOT
this is disgusting as a female track runner im so upset you cant deny the facts that you are a man we will support your change of sex but it doesnt change the fact that you trans are physically stronger,5,ABU
the other side of it is this in texas a young transman was forced to compete as birthsex female this person was hormonally transitioned into a male and its stupid and dishonest to say hormone therapy doesnt change your sex characteristics everything will change what you ended up with was the image of a young man with a young girl in a chokehold this young man had begged to compete against men and was not allowed they made him wrestle girls you can look at it and see its wrong this is also very clearly wrong neither side has this right but i stand flatly in the truth that in the binary the conservative position is always always always patently more stupid,3,NOT
what sick peopleparents need a brain transplant these  sound like boys,6,ABU
trans should not exist,6,ABU
mfs are still men at the end of the day so hell yeah they have the advantage thats just common sense,5,ABU
you as parents should be ashamed of yourselves has your son removed his penis,3,NOT
stick with your own sex you were born with,3,NOT
gtfoh this world is kooky and insane i argue these points here and there nobody is with this you have to be sick in the head it is not right and it is not fair there are only two human species male and female as far as im concerned i dont care what you choose to do with your life sex change your whatever however you choose to live is fine but when it comes to stuff like this it is a pure joke that is a man still a manno matter the surgeries and should not be able to compete against women men have testosterone women have estrogen this type of stuff makes me mad it is not fair men were made to protect women no matter how people try to swing it they can get the f over that s its disgusting how could you feel proud about yourself knowing that you are a man competing against weaker or women  to be honest this is one of those touchy topics i dont agree with it and i dont think it should be allowed its a gyp and its disrespectful to women they need women on women men on men and transsexual competitions how about that love you geisha good vid smh  look how many men evade s by getting sex changes bruce jenner in question his manly ass wanted to wait till hes what over  to try this and its only because he killed people in an accident and he didnt want to go to jail as soon as that happened he came out with this wannabe woman s still has no sex change and got woman of the year that is disrespectful at its finest there is definitely something wrong with men and this world,7,ABU
how do they have an advantage theyre running,1,NOT
people keep wanting to put feelings first yes i understand youre a transgender girl and thats your gender identity but you must understand that there is an obvious biological advantage that comes with being biologically born male like the woman said in the video men produce a lot of testosterone which increases the production of red blood cells that absorbs more oxygen enables men to develop larger skeletal muscles and develop larger hearts these give men a larger aerobic advantage so no transgender girls who are biologically men cannot and should not be allowed to compete with cisgender girls because of the obvious unfairness,5,ABU
i want crowder,2,NOT
pathetic cheats cant compete against men because there crap,5,ABU
i love it when the left paints itself into a corner  which is happening a lot these days,3,NOT
no shit they won theyre men regardless of what they think they are which is fine but if they are taking part in physical challenges how you identify shouldnt matter one fucking bit  it is irrelevant they are men they should be competing against men or we should make a special trans olympics if necessary,5,ABU
there are two genders you are born male or you are born femaleperiod,3,NOT
the fact that the parents or the  transgender girls dont see as this to be unfair is the real problem but we all know that if they were actually on the mens team we probably wouldnt even know who they are they wouldnt be dominating the boys track team its really disrespectful to continue to be on the team knowing that you have an advantage,3,NOT
the devil is alive and well,3,NOT
they have the edge against their female counterparts if they want to compete they should advocate for a league on their own lets stop calling apples to pears,5,ABU
if it has a dick its a male dick headed libs,5,ABU

trangender people have psychological problems,5,ABU

i never knew you had a cat also yea shes not trans lmao,3,NOT
i dont think trisha is trolling i think trishas mind is so whacked up that this is actually how her brain registers information and being on the internet in the public eye she just gets backlash for it mental instability is some shit man im telling you,5,ABU

all that botox is making her sick,3,NOT
look she isnt trans obviously but its kind of funny how exclusive and special some trans people think they are you are not better than someone else if you have transitioned fully to the opposite gender and actually accept the gender binary umm what about nonbinary genderfluid queer i just love how so many people in various minority groups such as lgbt like to and have literally no problem with telling other people how wrong they are but then insisting that other people accept them for who they identify as eg trans its just baffling even if you dont agree or understand how can you justify that when that is literally your life or has been in the past people judging you and not accepting you its just preposterous its like people with disabilities judging and not accepting other people with disabilities solely or in large part due to their disabilities like a deaf or blind person claiming they dont see it as a disability and insisting you accept them as they are and then judging not accepting and being ableist towards someone with down syndrome or who uses a wheelchair or something like wtf,3,NOT
cant be everything and nothing all at once im a fn mum i dont glam everyday and walk out the door in full garb to go to the shops just because i identify as a man i wear pants and shorts and big baggy ts but i classed that as i prefer to wear those things not because i think im a man her comment about having a dick makes things easier shit is hard no matter what your genitals are i feel she did this cause no one wants to hear about jason anymore and she obsesses over things this being no different i dont like masculine older men but jason and previous bfs prove different im a straight white female so i dont know if i have the right to have my opinion on this matter but here it is  great video blair loving your content lately,3,NOT
i think its incredibly ignorant for you to imply that for trisha to actually be trans they have to transition im not defending trisha and saying if theyre tans or not but you saying the the only way you would believe trish is if they transitioned is you implying that any trans person needsto transition to be an actual trans person,3,NOT

at first i found her video hilarious but then i got a migraine see im ftm myself and in the past ive watched trishas videos but only the ones where she hung out with other youtubers like shane dawson jeffree star etc that being said i never thought she was a bad person just a bit on the dramatic side now when i first viewed her video i was like crylaughing choking on my drink and shit but when i really began thinking and began seeing others getting offended by it i rewatched it i can see why everyones flipping shit trisha is literally using the transgender community to stay relevant because showing her tits on camera as a  year old woman is not working for her anymore thats thats bullshit i remembered all the shit i had to through just to get to wear boxers or a binder or cut my hair etc and the shit that i still do go through being a freshman in high school class of  aint lookin too openminded yikes and that got me thinking what the fuck like shes making us look worse the transgender community is already a hailstorm essentially but shes really dragging us through the mud her apology video wasnt even an apology like most youtuber apologies it was just a video of her trying to defend herself and make herself look like the victim i suggest you view that next sis but bring asprin she drags us through the mud but when we knock her ass down into the puddle she dragged us through she cries about it shes almost  and i think she needs to get the fuck off the platform really shes mistaking a midlife crisis for a gender identity dilemma luv u blaire you always do such great reactions and youre hella good at debating people and explaining situations youre and this is gonna sound weird as hell my favorite rightsider on youtube  keep doin what you do  sincerely that one dumbass kid who stays up way too late on pure caffeine alone,5,ABU
im glad you brought up masculinity and femininity not being gender itself im  and biologically male but at one point when i was  i was often being bullied for being too feminine and i got so pulled into that that i thought being a trans woman would solve all my problems but looking back now im happy that i stepped out of that because i would be depressed and regretful thanks to other men i learned that it was ok to be male and have a feminine side so again thank you blaire for bringing up masculinity and femininity,1,NOT
whats with those lips that woman person whatever is just a loon,5,ABU
can you react to her im questioning video pleasssse lol,2,NOT

you can be an ally without being trans trisha i get it its hard to know what is the right way to be supportive but thats why we watch channels like blaires blaire thank you for educating us and clearing up things that are difficult to understand i kinda get how trisha got confused though personally i did go through a phase where i wondered if i might be trans when i was a young teen but eventually i realized that i just dont like dressing in girly clothes or wearing make up that doesnt make me a trans man it just means i like being comfortable ,1,NOT
yes i love that thatbitch shirt,1,NOT
i believe woman is not only a troll but shes a dimwit im straight as can be and i know that what shes saying doesnt work that way,5,ABU
i think this is completley idiotic idk i think you should just stick with ehat you are and never try to be somet you arent,3,NOT
gigis video like actually makes me so angry i am not trans or apart of lgbtq community but i  support the community so this whole situation makes me so mad gigi as you stated paved the way for a lot of the trans community on youtube and i just feel like shes okay with her mocking them like youve dealt with this pain yourselfthe hate of your own body feeling so uncomfortable the mental toll it takes on you and have experienced what life is likeso wouldnt she be able to see trisha is trolling i personally feel like gigi is letting down the whole trans community for standing by her she is her friend and she should explain to her that she is not trans and that what she is doing is hurting people,2,NOT
my opinion  troll video for views  gender shouldnt be a big deal like using jonathan van ness  he came out and thats that we shouldnt be shoving things in peoples faces  i am a strong advocate for lgbtq rights and its sad that blaire thinks nonbinarism is a fad   trisha is crazy so we shouldnt be really caring too much about her but rather for trans rights   gender dysphoria i see  she just wants to be masc and fem in her gender expression not identity,5,ABU
thank you for calling her outshe is making a mockery out of herselfthis is honestly so infuriatingusing such a topic to get views,2,NOT
she sounds like a troll lol,3,NOT

trans formers more than meets the eye,2,NOT
i just hate how people like trisha just mocks the actual trans community,3,NOT
i think shes suffering from some type of trauma where she was raised to believe not doing your hair or makeup means youre a man obviously whoever made her believe that was a significant in her life and theyre sexist as fuck she needs to let go of that trauam before she becomes stable again there is so much she holds on to,3,NOT
she just needs attn it doesnt matter if its bad or good just give her attn its disrespectful but whatever,3,NOT
im not trans i live ur videos thank u for helping people,1,NOT
trisha really seems to struggle with her identity i dont know her or her content that well only hear about her a little from emelia fart and shane dawson but from what ive seen im thinking she might have histrionic personality disorder  as i cant comment on bpd seeing as how i dont know how much she fears abandonment maybe someone can inform me on that trisha definitely shows signs of radical attention seeking behavior and seductive mannerisms she covers quite a few of the symptoms of a histrionic cant take criticism well had a breakdown because ethan from hh goofed a little bit on her seems to make rash decisions now she believes shes trans which isnt something anyone should take that lightly being overly concerned with physical appearance even though here she claims she walks around wearing no makeup but thats moreso when shes alone which is different etc cant say for sure though since i dont watch her content directly nor do i know her personally she does generally give me a bad vibe like i can tell i wouldnt want to meet her in person ever,3,NOT
when i that very shy cat see me staring at it ,1,NOT
im not even trans and shes not making any sense to me i can only imagine how actual trans people are sitting there watching her and just going what the hell,3,NOT
i feel like this is literally representative of the entire nonbinary movement i sincerely hope that this is a joke and shes doing it satirically to point out the fact that fashion is not the same as gender lol but whether she meant to or not thats what she did for any person capable of logical coherent thought love you blaire ,3,NOT
smart as a marble please blaire,1,NOT
lol anyone else notice the chickfila,1,NOT
this channel is devolving into a trainwreck,3,NOT

now we need im deceased shirt with you passing out while drinking chick fil a you did this to yourself blaire this is your fault xd,1,NOT
so i came across this term  which i had to look up transmasculine it refers to a cis female who expresses herself with traits normaly considered maleish so im personally not sure if this is a legitimate nonbinary gender but if it is considered to be and nonbinary is included under the umbrella transgender or is it the other way around  then this trish certainly has a legitimate case for being transgender,1,NOT
claims to be a man wears rainbow sparkle stiletto nails,3,NOT
youre awesome love your content,1,NOT
ooooo i was waiting for this onnnneeeee,1,NOT
my thoughts are that trisha has had mental problems for a damn long time and yes she is just trolling for views because what does she have to offer anyway shes a freaking cartoon and she needs mental help,5,ABU

i am a gendernonconforming person and i hate when celebritiesyoutubers do shit like this for attention ,3,NOT
can you believe there are actually hard working people out there that actually contribute something to society just like my mom who was a single mother raising me and my autistic brother who is very low functioning while working hard my whole entire life that get such a shitty paychecks and basically no recognition for the hard work they put in but girls like trisha paytas are millionaires being idolize and people wanna be just like her but all shes doing is making such idiotic and crazy videos basically being a moron on the internet for a living its just fucked up and not right people like her are the reasons why the youth is so fucked up these days most kids have no clue what it means to respect themselves and respect others and we all know she actually doesnt identify as being trans shes just doing this coming out video for moneyviews thats basically the narrative of all her videos and that some how makes her a queen please this world is so shit,6,ABU
i am pan and i love gay men and would fuk them if given the chance so um ,2,NOT
im deceased  fucking dead,1,NOT
this is vodka by the way iconic,1,NOT
honestly this is one big reason why i have such a problem with all of the extra genders people come up with theyre supposedly fighting against gender norms but creating these new genders is basically saying if youre a guy with these feminine traits then you shouldnt be identifying as a guy and things like that it actually reinforces gender roles by saying youre only a guy if you act like a stereotypical guy and youre only a girl if you act like a stereotypical girl like no when i hung out with guys as a kid and tried to fit in with them that was just called being a tomboy nothing more its really not a big deal until you start throwing in all these extra genders and specifications on what it takes to be a specific gender,2,NOT
this woman trisha is absolutely delusional and needs help she goes from one subject to another and she is obviously not sober in this video and most of the ones she makes that are highly controversial she needs to grow the fuck up,5,ABU
that trisha video disgusts me but all liers for attention disgust me xd but in general the whole movement to use the transgender community for clicks is big oof sometimes they can even hurt real trans people through the bullshit they are talking just in that sense that normalcis people who see it will get this picture of trans and apply it to everyone they meet in real life who is really trans and treat them badly or in a way they dont deserve to be treated also make more videos with your cat he or she is a cutie xd,3,NOT
omg i love you this is vodka btw bwahahahahah yasss i agree ,1,NOT
congrats on your transition from female to female,2,NOT
you are gorgeous and hilarious im subscribing i love this ,1,NOT
when did people start taking what trisha says as truth yall know shes been trolling since the beginning of youtube right,3,NOT
literally sounds like she is nonbinary with a gay man fetish but didnt do any research into her own sexuality and decided she was tans and called it a day,2,NOT
anyone whos seriously hurt from this truly needs some thicker skin lets talk about the bigger issue here why are we giving so much power to one persons thoughts,2,NOT
i feel like she is overthinking everything and is going through some sort of crisis she might just need some help o dont mean to be rude but i think she might just be struggling with mental health issues,3,NOT
im a lesbian transgender male to female who doesnt do surgery or dress up or anything because a thousand percent i like my body hey ladies d,3,NOT
i love this video but why did you give money to chik fil a,1,NOT

me normally am i trans yes  me around my extended family do i identify with my natural born gender ,2,NOT
blaire you look so damn cute in black,1,NOT
im not trans but i had an actual diagnosis of gender identity disorder from a psychiatrist  years ago theres a distinction here i think of myself as a very masculine woman but not trans trans requires that you actually make effort to look like the gender you believe you are i cant bring myself to transition because i know it isnt a cureall to do so i dont even think i could handle the mental changes that come with transitioning having a diagnosis of what is now called gender dysphoria doesnt make me trans,1,NOT
she seems addicted to attention,3,NOT
fuck off you beautiful human youre intelligent and your soul shines through i love the way you speak about people and issues you feel honest and genuine never stop being you,2,NOT
i think she is trans a trans psychotic woman,5,ABU
i think the allure of gay men because gay men doesnt salivaterate the hotness of a girl instantly lol  i understand the fetish for gay men sorry to say i am like that especially if they are in the closet because of their emotional longing feels beautifulthats just me thoughi dont know about other girlsthis fetish is bad because other than its very rude gay guys could manipulate those girls to get stuff lol ive seen it before also about being trans ive been told i was a tomboy for so long by people around me because im very nerdy and was hyper so there was a time i thought i was trans although when i rethink it hey i did excitingly anticipated having boobs and menstruation when i was younger so really to know who we are we have to really evaluate all of our emotions carefully but it depends on our goal i think trisha just clickbaiting hahaha,2,NOT
that cute yip in the beginning ,1,NOT
the comments section of this video is a goldmine not this comment though,1,NOT

i appreciate trisha for doing this and applaud her for it why because the more big names like her and sam smith that do this for attention the faster the general public gets sick and tired of this trend it needs to die once and for all,3,NOT
lol how does her attraction to gay men her being a normal woman who doesnt always doll herself up and her use of an outdated psychology theory that has no scientific proof have to do with being trans she is def trying to get more views not fair for people who are actually trans im cis and barely dress up have definitely been attracted to gay men but respected their sexuality and envy mens power sometimes but like no i could never honestly say im trans it isnt like that trisha honey btw i love your pronouns genius woman,2,NOT
theres no way she doesnt have multiple personalities ,3,NOT
its nonsense like this that makes me think maybe bullies are a good thing then i remember that i never really got bullied during the  year of my life spent in socal and didnt turn out like trisha there so,3,NOT
whats wrong with this womans lips,3,NOT

finally someone spoke sense on this matter do you think youll be making more member videos in the future btw,1,NOT
dont go for trish this is her ,2,NOT
i agree with everything you said except for when you said that if you think someone isnt lgbtq you just shouldnt call them by their preferred pronouns and name or believe them when they say they like someone ive thought that people have faked it before and i was wrong so i always just try to be respectful if they arent hurting anyone i dont care who you like or what your pronouns are ive some out to people i thought were friends and they said i was faking and im not and people have said that im faking having anxiety for attention when i actually go to therapy and have real problems also the part when you said that celebrities just come out to get more famous one person i can think of that didnt do that is brendon urie from panic at the disco he came out as pan he donates to lgbtq charities and he had the highest hopes foundation he also sings girlsgirlsboys at all the shows not everyone just wants to come out to be interesting some people just want their fans to understand them more and feel not as alone sorry for my rant thanks for coming to my ted talk,2,NOT
who is this person why do they look like they had really bad plastic surgery done and why does this person have to have the same first name as me,3,NOT

i absolutely love you but cant help notice that you are so much like jefree,2,NOT
yea i dont do my hair or make up almost ever either its called motherhood,2,NOT
i think this day in age a lot of people want to stand out or feel like they dont belong so they will claim lgbtq and its sad because of how many real people struggled for so long with gender dysphoria etc for me i thought liking girls would send me to hell i think its become cool to a lot of people who arent lgbtq and that makes me ,1,NOT
shes obviously very confused i know jason is thanking god he dodged a bullet,3,NOT
i cant believe trishas logic she thinks that shes trans and cis at the same time while thinking that shes black while shes pale as fuck,5,ABU

so im a straight cis woman but im aware im pretty masculine i dont know why but i have a lot of mannerism that seem more manly but i dont let it bother me when people call me out for it which people have ive always been one of the guys but ive always loved that and im glad i can hang out with guys and they dont feel like they have to act a certain way around me because im a girl ive always been a major tomboy but have i ever thought i was trans hell nah im perfectly fine with being a girl and on days when i feel like it i love to get dolled up and look my best in makeup and dresses have i ever had feelings for gay guys oh yeah my ex was even a closeted gay and i had to end that relationship because he cheated on me with my best friends boyfriend but just because im masculine and i liked those guys before doesnt mean i wanted to be a trans guy just to be with them,2,NOT

my first halloween in la was in weho i saw the most incredibly gorgeous men like absolutely beautiful i thought i was in heaven it took me a while to realize what was going on there was gay people in my small town but i wasnt really around the community growing up so when i found the community i fell in love high school musical looking muscular emotional in touch men it was confusing as fuck to me that they were with other men i was confused about myself i was so tall and had a large build and felt masculine sometimes especially next to some of these extremely feminine gay men i thought i was a lesbian for the longest time i thought feeling masculine equates to me liking woman i was attracted to woman but i was not a lesbian i fell for my gay male best friends it was hard not to they understood me i thought maybe i was male inside sometimes but chose to present female years later ive dated mostly men ive had sexual relations with both but none of thatin the end really has anything to do with feeling masculine im biologically female who has some masculine emotions traits and physical attributes at times i am female and so is trisha,3,NOT

i honestly feel kinda bad for her she is getting all this shame and i think she may just be confused no i dont mean the offensive confused that us bisexuals get labelled with all the time i genuinely think she is unfamiliar with the genderspectrum i may be completely wrong she could be in the beginning of her journey and for all i know she planned this for clout noone knows and noone will know so we are all basically torturing ourselves with unneccessary drama like when are we going to start ignoring coming out videos we all want it to be where people shouldnt have to come out or be labeled so why are we still acknowledging the flaws in others view about themself instead of moving ahead,2,NOT
i didnt realize sam smith was nonbinary i know nonbinary seems like a new thing to a lot of people but i assure you the only thing new about it is having a term for it my entire life ive been a nongendered person personally i feel like there are a lot of people coming out because its trendy but imo if even  of those people are legitimately trans and more comfortable coming out about it now im okay with it so long as its not young people who can take things too far and permanently change their bodies in ways they cant change back if they change their mind i think medical intervention should only be for adults i have mixed feelings about hormone blockers for trans kids and i dont know enough about it to have a solid opinion,2,NOT
muscles glistening in the wind floored me,1,NOT
shes just on the same thought process that leads sjws to invent another sexuality to describe themselves and of course not understanding that gender and sexuality are two different things seriously its like none of them get that is part of that process so since shes attracted to gay guys i guess she could call herself a homosexual also i want to be identified as king of all reality does that mean sjws have to pay me tribute while were at it im also native american and black so gimme some of that casino and reparations money if you dont youre a disgusting racist,5,ABU
i kind of understand trisha i always was interested in guys that are femine i was also attracted to this one girl who was really masculine basically i am attracted to people that are between genders although i like masculine guys also when i was younger i always was gay guy in my erotic dreams still to this day i sometimes have a dick in my dreams however i dont think about changing my gender im comfortable enough in my skin to say that since guys usually prefer women i wanna stay female additionally if i cant be a handsome guy i rather not be a guy at all if she have similar issues to me then i think she is overreacting maybe trying to get the attention she succeeded edit i written it while still watching i am now sure she is there only for the attention,3,NOT

trisa seems to have the same mentality i did in middle school when i was just leaning about this stuff and trying to figure myself out and my sister was trying to push me to be trans news flash im not,2,NOT
trisha is always a big troll and trolls with controversial topics this isnt new lol,3,NOT
someone asked me about this fucking train wreck yesterday when i was teaching a class on lgbt information and experiences i just laughed and said its click bait but they asked how this impacts our community i said its a shit storm that gives extremists ammo to come at us with,3,NOT
i think we all know trisha is mentally ill and if a therapist truly told her this they need to lose their license,5,ABU

chick fil a,1,NOT
blair pretending her face could ever be ugly stfu lol,2,NOT
girl i know youre not putting your dollar into chik fil a they openly hate the lgbtq community we can do better,2,NOT
she needs a doctor to exam her dam head lol,5,ABU
so this is how she feels not biologically she a girl who was actually beautiful at one time was dissed by her ex because he ended up liking dicks too this made her crazy so much that she questions her own identity she now sees herself as a boy who likes dicks so is she gay no shes a biological girl that likes dicks no matter what she decides to wear,5,ABU
its bothering me how trishas face looks like its trying to melt off her face like just a deflated balloon,5,ABU
like by the way with what she said but what the hell is with her face  is she on crack ,5,ABU
if she was trans she wouldnt of gotten like  boob jobs i cant stand her lmao,3,NOT

a gay trans men is that not a straight woman,3,NOT
trisha paytas  jessica jonathan yaniv  ever,1,NOT
trisha paytas is out of her mind,5,ABU
its not sexism its a result of societal sexism that makes her hate her own gender,3,NOT
who is this trisha and whats wrong with her face especially her lips,3,NOT
i still have no idea why tp is watched by anyone i cant eye roll enough when i even hear her name let alone her speaking,3,NOT
bruh isnt this when she did  becoming shane dawson vid lmao,2,NOT
i cant with trisha anymore ,2,NOT
the logical conclusion of the wake movement everyone must identify as trans or be outed as transphobic,3,NOT
shes got one of those strange faces that kind oughta be attractive but also repulse you at the same time like the different parts of her face have come from attractive people but dont go together right maybe she looks in the mirror and cant come to terms with her appearance and its screwed with her mind or this is all just bullshit and she wants money and attention,5,ABU
this is definitely one of her many troll videos she just needed some adsense money as no one really cared about her moaning about david dobrik for  months,3,NOT
that video was a little different in my opinion i legit feel like trisha just wants so badly to belong somewhere thats shes just grabbing at straws now and not caring who she hurts on her way i dont think this is her trolling i think this is her desperately trying to inject herself somewhere anywhere she thinks she might be accepted,2,NOT
please do another video on her new videos about her being trans,2,NOT
she is literally the yes im no no im yes we no yes meme ,2,NOT
blair is honesty my favourite person on earth ,1,NOT
telling trisha that shes not transgender is no different than other people in the past being told they just have a mental illness that come out as transgender  anyone can be transgender just bc she doesnt qualify as trans to some doesnt mean she isnt love and acceptance should be towards everyone,2,NOT
at one point i thought i wanted to be trans but really i just wanted to be a boy cause id feel more powerful in a way im so glad i didnt do anything stupid like transitioning and instead worked to be a stronger woman when i began to embrace my more gothic side i really got that strong edge i was craving i finally feel more intimidating,2,NOT
if this is real  somebody really doesnt understand what being transgender is by the way non binary yeah not a thing you can be a masculine woman or a feminine man but you cant be neither male or female just saying ,5,ABU
i saw one person on an instagram post talking about meds and what they do to your head they said a lot of people they know that took meds were saying strange shit about their sexuality and changing it trisha definitely has metal health problems and is probably on meds i think she is dont quote me on that im not defending her but if this is cause by meds then i feel bad for her but i also wanna wait and see if shane literally trishas best friend will say anything about this,3,NOT
im so glad you did this video,1,NOT
i am sorry you have mutilated yourself and lost your mind,6,ABU
trisha ive always been attracted to gay guys  james charles has left the chat,2,NOT
lmfaoooooo i love the chick fil a,1,NOT
honestly im so worn out from all her emotional outbursts and fluctuations that im just like  oh okay were doing this now i mean i genuinely feel that trisha needs to seek professional help for her alleged bpd because it just keeps getting more and more outlandish this is just a lot for me because wow ya know,3,NOT
im not even going to try and understand her logic,3,NOT
you have very similiar voice which is very confusing,2,NOT
not wanting to get ready full glam everyday doesnt make you any less of a woman,2,NOT
i think what you said about sam smith is gross show some respect not everything is for clout,3,NOT
you are so beautiful hotties chick i ever seen ,1,NOT
that bimbo trisha questioned if dogs have a brain because they dont talk i think right there  case closed ,5,ABU
ugly faces bitch where,6,ABU
im girly but dont wear makeup most days but i think shes confused and has body issues,2,NOT
slay queen also the kitty is adorable,1,NOT
i watched trisha long before she had a partnership and was a huge youtube star she is completely odd years ago she said she was a lesbian despite dating males before that and considering herself straight i also find it hard for her to call herself transsexual because she always seemed comfortable identifying as a cis female in the past,3,NOT
ive never seen this trisha person before what is all over her face she looks like a homeless person homeless woman,5,ABU
seems like trish is jealous she cant join the lgbt community,3,NOT
is it just mean to think in my head that blair is also just as mental because heshe is transso im basically watching one dellusional person critiquecall out another dellusional person who is to say which one is more sane,6,ABU
how about you just be you that shit sounded so loud my gooood,2,NOT
i think shes a flamboyant gamine which means shes a female with a higher yang balance but some features of yin like tina turner audrey hepburn and lady gaga im a guy whose almost the oppisite in body typing im a theatrical romantic so im a guy who has a higher yin female energylines balance examples being prince johnny depp and sure sometimes i feel way more fem especially around other men but that doesnt mean im trans or nothing like that i cant believe she really said  ,2,NOT
you are stunning,1,NOT
me me me me me me,2,NOT
if shes trans then im a tank,3,NOT
her reasoning for being  trans is incredibly contradictory to the ftm community trans men who are attracted to men get attacked constantly for fetishizing gay men and people think that they were so obsessed that they had to transition and thats literally what trisha is saying and having short hair has absolutely nothing to do with being a man she can easily be empowered as a woman with short hair theres no use helping this dysfunctional hungover woman,5,ABU
react to her stupid did scandal she just manages to offend at least one community every damn year,3,NOT
this is why we need to get rid of sexism what trisha is saying is literally just sexism with all the gender identities these days people are getting confused,3,NOT
makeup doesnt make u any less or more of a woman,1,NOT
im attracted to gay men im feel masculine because im assertive shes literally just your garden variety western masculinized woman they all say these things ive heard these comments hundreds of times in real life meanwhile everything about her demeanor screams femininity shes literally just overthinking herself,2,NOT
just because your energy doesnt match your sex doesnt mean youre trans thank you as a feminine trans man that means a whole bunch,2,NOT
shes trolllingggg ohmygod,3,NOT
 gigi girl what are you doing that hat and scarf tho ,2,NOT
shes trolling for clicks,3,NOT
i cant imagine how trans people feel and i cant imagine how one notices that you are trans because i am not but i always liked football and the colour blue but i am not a boy,3,NOT
as a straight guy who has never pushed past his curious phasei cant stand all of these people jumping on the trending bandwagon all they are doing is setting all genuine people and movements back how can anyone be taken seriously when there are people like this and others who blindly support them be who you are because thats who you are not because its trending,3,NOT
okay i hate trisha shes basically rachel dolezal on crack who hung out too much off of western ave and south virgil after getting slapped by ms in gang bangs too much that needs to be dicked down by many men on pornhub thats all shes worth,7,ABU
why is eden deffending trishaa wthhh happened to heeeer,2,NOT
shes not trans and gigi does not pass hes a dude,5,ABU
gg you have to believe that person me actually i only have to accept facts not delusions,5,ABU
when i first saw this video it was kind of hilarious to me and now as a young  yr old it bothers me i new i was a trans man for about a year before this video was recommended to me but it hurts because shes kind of mocking and making fun of how i and other people feel she is making young children feel as if theyre not valid because of the idiocy in that video then she just goes about her channel as if she hadnt spread miss information about what transgender people feel yes she might be confused but putting it out on the internet is not the best thing to do,3,NOT
im new to your channel ive just subscribed damn youre beautiful much love from england,1,NOT
she looked like she was on drugs her whole video im honestly just done with her  shes too old to be so ignorant shes sooo harmful to the community period,5,ABU
subscribed our point of views are exactly the same this video needed to be made,1,NOT
i identify as a gay male who is only sexually attracted to females and if you question my logic you are literally hitler,5,ABU
im hooked on your intelligence personality and the rest never thought id be a fan of a transgyoure real so rare we love you god bless and keep you safe,2,NOT
trisha deserves zero respect from everyone and anyone,3,NOT
i think shes getting self presentation and gender identity mixed up as well as letting her sexuality confuse how she feels about her own gender theres also the big possibility shes conpletly trolling,2,NOT
trisha may be an attention whore but if she is trolling with all this and people take her seriously ill have to take my hat offlol,5,ABU
i mean i love the look of being a masc almost stereotypical lesbian sometimes because i feel good like that do i also like looking super feminine and pretty yes you can enjoy masculinity and femininity  but like what also she doesnt want theythemhehim pronouns so im perplexed,2,NOT
so im a girl who is attracted to gay guys even though things would never work out lol does that make me transhell no,3,NOT
i really really really think trisha is a bit smarter than we make her out to be she understands how to get clicks and traffic to her channel no such thing as bad publicity and i really think she is making fun of how crazy and trendy some people are with identities i see her video as a parody but she wont say that cause she already has bad backlash coming her way,2,NOT
you know i dont really like your channel that much but i agree that trisha is not transgender she needs help because shes sick in the head she is an attention seeker with multiple insecurities,5,ABU
im mourning the death of my last two brain cells omg you are a legend its  seconds in and im crying fromlaughing,1,NOT
omg that intro was super adorable lol ,1,NOT
your face is really cute holy fuck,1,NOT
there is so much i want to say but there simply arent words strong enough,2,NOT
if you are an entrepreneur dont hire women problems will be solved much sooner,5,ABU
this is not true this is propaganda this video and this channel are lies rightwing think tank lies,3,NOT
men have better paid jobs than women quick we have to put more women in better paid jobs for the sake of equality there are more men homeless than women quick we have to put more women in streets for the sake of equality,3,NOT
i challenge anyone to correctly tell me anything stated in this video that is not a cold hard fact,2,NOT
i saw a barista once she thought she was oppressed cause she earnt less than an electrical engineer,2,NOT
wage gap is real you people always conveniently leave out why things happen instead relying entirely on that things are happening,2,NOT
this is so true feminists need to get over themselves and get to work,3,NOT
so a  cents is acceptable  the problem with this video is that you dont look deep enough you explain the differences by choices of career carreer evolution and working hour this is where the sexist issues are when choosing an orientation women are told that petroleum ingeneering etc is for men and that early education nursing and such are for women as for evolution we see that with equal education a man will be more and faster promoted than a women a study gave the same curriculum to companies half with the name john half with the name jessica the companies were willing to pay john  a year more than jessica that is sexism in the enterprise finally women are working less hour because they are still the ones who have to take care of the children of the house etc so of course they cant stay as long in the office once all these problems have been addressed then we will see equality since you like maths you should know that according to the millions of people we are talking about the law of large numbers applies aif there was no inequality the pay difference should be infinitesimal thanks for reading until the end it shows open mindness,2,NOT
i hope that the female population and the media finally gets it what you earn depends on the choices you make not on your sex,2,NOT
just sent this video to a feminist i was blocked right away xd,3,NOT
thanks for this video i am at awe with the fact that i have met people who genuinely believe that the wage gap exists,3,NOT
 of statistical data is made up on the spot,1,NOT
oh its only  less then i guess it isnt an issue right who cares as long as it isnt a  difference how can you cite a study showing a genderbased pay gap and then say there is no pay gap how dumb do you think we are this video completely sidesteps the fact that women feel compelled to enter these traditionally female majors just as men gravitate towards traditionally male majors its kind of unfortunate that women were given lowerpaying jobs when they entered the workforce in ww because now the roles have solidified into basically the same roles from  years ago men get higherpaying jobs because they were traditionally the main income earner and women were either single and living on their own or just earning a little extra pay ive gone through the data did you know that women are more likely to switch majors if they earn a low grade in the introductory classes cs get degrees yet for some reason women feel pressure to earn better grades than men on average prageru also forgot that maternity leave is expensive and that its the most commonly cited reason employers have when they are found to have different pay rates for men and women in the same job why would you hire someone who gets a month of paid leave when someone else doesnt when a woman goes on maternity leave a new temp must fill in until she is gone or the firm goes with one less worker for a month either way its an expense they dont have with male employeesthats why people are arguing for paternity leave so this difference is resolved prageru best cherrypickers on youtube who needs truth when you can just ignore everything that proves counterpoint to your beliefs,2,NOT
this is a woman saying this meaning feminists are people who want money,5,ABU
theres a study by the berau of labor statistics that shows in fine enough detail same job different pay they do not state anything about employers but it does highly suggest a wage gap exists theory higher paying companies tend to hire more men for whatever reasons this would create a pay difference not seen anywhere but statistics only way i can imagine wage gap existing and that study really does suggest it does also jobs that will match your pay from one place in order to hire you thatd be another way unequal pay could exist then femtards take this sliver of fact and go nuts with it,3,NOT
for once im actually happy i got an ad on yt i really hope this vid spreads more so more people will know,1,NOT
but why do women have less good positionswhy are they less educatedwhy do they take less paied jobs im not a feminist,3,NOT
guess what the wage gap exists even between only men but of different age between different parts of the same city among men in different fields etc etc etc,3,NOT
i had the biggest smile at the first line d,1,NOT
my mom still refuses the facts if only she understood the people influencing her are crooked and just have a good personality on tv,3,NOT
if women can be men and men can be women and gender is a just social construct then there is no such thing as a wage gap,3,NOT
the fact that a woman is explaining in this video proves this show no gender bias,2,NOT
because men dont think women can do the same jobs as well you idiot,5,ABU
have you ever seen an all female construction crew build a  floor skyscraper ,2,NOT
the fact of the matter is that when you look at the big picture women generally do not want the same job types as men far more men go into stem jobs like engineering mathematics science and technology those jobs pay way more as a result when you look at the total amount of money earned between men and women men make more but when you account for the differences in job types and education the wage gap vanishes to a much smaller amount  cents per dollar  not the  cents claimed to illustrate this point further white people only make  cents for every dollar that an asian person makes the reason is not because there is some discrimination going on it is the exact same reason that men make more than women as a whole this is because even more asians go into stem jobs than average caucasians wage gaps really have very little to do with discrimination it just so happens that women for whatever reason do not choose to go into higher paying jobs and do not choose to work as much overtime etc and it just so happens that asians go into high paying jobs even more that is why whites make  cents for every dollar than an asian makes and that is why women make  cents per dollar that men make its just looking at the total amount of money that a group makes it is not accounting for differences in what types of jobs different groups go into it does not account for voluntary overtime differences and it does not take into account educational differences etc its only looking at the total income of men versus women  and this produces a very misleading result,2,NOT
you just destroyed every wage gap feminist sjw guy,3,NOT
this is shocking,2,NOT
the lord shall bless you,1,NOT
get ready for itthe next argument about the wage gap that feminists are now using is males simply wont allow them to enter the higher paying professions men are sexist and competitive and therefore scare woman away from the career by hurting their feelings so now instead of choosing petroleum engineer women now have to go into a lower paid position like social work their arguments never die  they just come up with new stupid ones after their old ones are debunked and die out ive actually had feminist friends say that girls are purposely intimidated out of math and science careers so that men can solely hold those positions,3,NOT
the only thing this shows is that the politics has to do something so that women are able to work long hours and have children just like men,2,NOT
whilst i agree that the traditional idea and slogan of  cents to a dollar is misleading and fails to take into account all kinds of factors we cant blame the lack of women in the scientific fields on the idea that men and women make different choices its a weak argument there remains strong social stigmas and discouragement against girls and women in those fields which we must fight against,1,NOT
so women are dumb basically,5,ABU
this gave me a better understanding of the topic i didnt believe the wage gap made that much of a difference because it really does depend on the job occupation you chose it is understandable why a women would get paid less since he jobs women chose are much safer than the jobs that men do men are capable of doing much more than women in a physical manner it is not sexist its just how people were made in the video it explained that if you do the math the wage gap only depends on your occupation and the amount came out to  cents women tend to stick to jobs like counseling social work and education these jobs are considered the worst paying majors the highest paying majors are careers like engineering and science based which men have a high percentage employed in these fields i agree with the videos argument the wage gap is more of a myth and that it is all based on your career options its not to often you see a women working a very laborous and dangerous job its a mans job because they are able to put up with certain jobs better than women,2,NOT
coal miner i cant breathnurse i dont give a shit he worked  hrs last week i need thanksgiving off meanwhile coal miner died i would argue men should make more then they do now,5,ABU
as a loan officer at bofa so during the course of a day i would ask several people how much money the husband and the wife makes i found in the vast majority of families it is actually the woman with the stable job who makes more money but when they average in the the high wage earner males into it it appears that men make more so for example out of  couples  would have the wife who makes more money they fourth the husband may make more than all of other men and women put together i am guessing that are looking the the numbers in the fourth family the wife is likely to not work at all so they would count her income as zero because her husband makes more money then all of the other people combined they would then say men make more money on the other hand i find liberals lie about statistics and really bend the rules to come up with the result they want to come up with,3,NOT
my mother is a personal trainer she makes around minimum wage my father is a plant manager he pays for just about everything my mother chose to switch from the factory work my dad stayed in after having my sister she wanted a more flexible schedule so she could be able to take care of us she went and got her dream job dad is usually on call can work up to  hours on a bad day and  on a good one he has been at the same place for almost  years if he could he would get an easier lower paying job but he cant afford to my fiancee is a mechanic he makes  an hour unlicensed when he writes his test it could jump to    when we have kids he could be close to hr i am going into medical office administration while it can eventually pay in the s i will never earn as much as him unless i end up being promoted or get extra schooling i am at a disadvantage though when kids happen we both want me to be stay at home until the last kid is in school so thats a lot of years of advancement i lose this is my choice in the end no matter what a woman who wants a family will end up sacrificing more time even if just to birth and recover what we need to do is encourage women to try trades and high academic pursuit shared maternity leave or father maternity leave fathers as stay at homes seriously if you could afford it who wouldnt love time off or even when you are staying home and on leave taking classes related to your field to keep your knowledge current i believe that if we want to we can close the tiny gap left and all be happy,1,NOT
so  feminazis thumbed this down i know those pesky facts,6,ABU
this argument is used so much that i just say men earn it,2,NOT
ok im reading lots of comments about how a teacher makes less than a ceo clearly people didnt watch the video its about fir the same job a ceo would definitely make more the argument were making is for the same job dont get butthurt about my opinion its what i think,2,NOT
now im thinking about international economics like outsourcing for reduced cost where a country is labor intensive,1,NOT
interesting how silly videos brought me here well glad they did because this has given quite the impression very educational and informative and these videos help me understand what makes the stupid people so stupid thumbs up,3,NOT
 actual wage gap shrinks to only  cents when you factor in different choices men and women make  the small wage gap that does exist has to do with differences in individual career choices but thats exactly what the study accounted for,3,NOT
what i want is a study done on is the like to dislike gap actually dont bother,2,NOT
thank you prageru my very leftist school just held a whole school assembly about the gender wage gap and how its such an awful problem this video has given me a lot of facts to fight back with d,2,NOT
the biggest argument for there not being a pay gap is the equal pay act of  which made it illegal to discriminate against womens pay every year there is an average of  law suits over the violation of this law roughly  percent win thats  people a year can actually prove that they were discriminated against in the workplace thats mind bogglingly few people,2,NOT
does anyone have the link to these studies contradicts other data ive found so far so would greatly appreciate,1,NOT
im sorry but i think these facts should be examined carefully st companies do not only want to reduce costs they are willing to hire better professionals paying them more nd women tend to chose low paying majors not just because of simple individual will culture sex roles family etc are mediating variables that influences these decisions same in men men are raised hearing they should beare good at math and fixing things also they are socially rewarded by compliments etc by being good at these fields no doubt they chose engineering and math as a major their toys as kids are astronaut dolls and mechanics women toys are babies and nurse barbie women are raised as the caring ones the mommy ones no doubt they chose social work and early education it is sexism people dont make decisions out of nowhere culture and society are playing a role there rd we need to examine why men are willing to be on call in a job men have the pressure to be the provider in the family thats why they are willing to be on call willing to have a better salary women dont have these pressure and the ones who have it are not the standard this video has some points but i think every idea exposed here needs to be discussed in a deeper way it shouldnt be this simple to talk about a subject this complex,2,NOT
i feel bad for myself that i am a woman and i have make really big choices in life like to pause my career to bear a child,2,NOT
there is still an unaccounted pay gap that cant be explained by less experience or choice of workhours but that gap is only about  not the  or more some people throw around still a gap is a gap and worth trying to close although socioeconomic issues can still have effects long after the innitial cause is solved meaning that policy regarding the gap shouldnt be too radical or prevention of yesterdays problems,2,NOT
hey thats pretty good,1,NOT
 you know that average and median arent the same thing right i mean they might happen to be the same number depending upon the data set in question though they often arent the same number as well but they are still decidedly not the same thing or calculated the same way,2,NOT
dont you understand  we are patriarch  every night i say to my daughter that she should not go to college or in stem  oh wait we dont,3,NOT
i wonder whether its ever occurred to her that maybe the reasons why women choose to go into fields that pay less and to work fewer hours etc are because of the way our society is structured unequally which is still a relevant sexist issue in any case a wage gap narrowed to  is still wage gap and not negligible like she seems to think,2,NOT
some women are either just dumb or simply stupid for thinking a myth such as the wage gap actually exists,6,ABU
im all for equal pay for equal work but heres my  cents from the computer science field i work in a group of ish people  if you extrapolate to the other subgroups working with us among all of them  are women one does pure managing one does pure testing and that leaves a single woman actually writing or designing code  even then i have to personally coach her so she can write proper code theres sexism and theres objective data ill leave you the role of finding which i just used,3,NOT
couldnt have explained it better myself i hope more people keep watching this video thanks,1,NOT
so there is a gender wage gap by  to  this video implies that men are more hardworking than women and wage discrimination is due to this occurring keep in mind though that the department of labour concluded that this margin is not explained so there is a contradiction in this video,2,NOT
why is there a gap huh men work harder and more reliable that will stay true until men get pregnant okay,3,NOT
correct as usual,1,NOT
thank the lord,1,NOT
 triggered feminists,3,NOT
doesnt matter what year it is idiots are still going to believe this myth,3,NOT
ok i am  yrs old and have always been told i am observer of the human scene and i have witnessed something interesting these gender wage gap surveys cant be generalized for every and all jobs i have witnessed half a dozen examples where women actually make more than men in some industries doesnt anyone say anything about that no because of the modern feminist movement fact is that were human beings and we usually gravitate toward a man or woman when a seeking a service or a product need an example i used to work as a bartender and server i cleared more tips in a day than my male counterparts cleared in a week need something further up the food chain i disagree with what this lady said about male nurses as i used to work in a hospital and heard the stories about nurses even with male nurses who would chat with me when days were slow i have witnessed first hand that female nurses get paid more than their male counterparts to the point that there male counterparts have to go on welfare because they can make enough to even pay their bills even you are a doctor at times a person will gravitate more toward a woman or a man example women who are gynecologists dermatologists acupuncturists psychiatrists psychologists alternative health professionals get paid more than their male counterparts how do i know this i work as medical biller and have done this job for  years doing bills for various healthcare professionals so is there a gender pay gap no i have come to the conclusion that it all just depends on where you are in the world how you work etc,2,NOT
this is awesome and all but since when do femenist and leftist care about facts,3,NOT
maddox sure does look different these days,2,NOT
wow i felt so lied to this was a great video and i feel a lot better in understanding that this isnt an issue,1,NOT
there is an enforced wage gap at my company men start at  more than woman no matter what,2,NOT
one of the greatest thing i heard recently about the wage gap was that a spend gap should be introduced when you look at how much the two genders earn and how much they spend everything miraculously evens out lmao,2,NOT
so what youre saying is there is a wage gap the argument is just over the size of that wage gap,1,NOT
come on prageru you already made a video about this same exact topic  years ago pull your heads out of your asses,3,NOT
this video is accurate on every accountexcept when it comes to childrearing the reason why men work longer hours even without prior notice is because they are the ones that more than half the time are responsible for less than half of all child and home related activities and responsibilities sexism does exist and even now women are still expected to take care of more than  of all domestic responsibilities this video implies sexism plays no part whatsoever and fails to factor in who takes care of the children in american households and how much,2,NOT
 dislikes are triggered feminists,3,NOT
make this viral,1,NOT
if youre a feminist and you are spouting this women earn c for every man dollar argument youre either an idiot who doesnt know what theyre talking about or youre not an idiot you know the truth and you still knowingly use these garbage statistics to manipulate people into your cause i dont know which is worse either way as soon as someone mentions it i just check out,6,ABU
well put but i figured you would have made this a looooong time ago,1,NOT
hmm it is kind of wierd and even absurd that they calculate average salary that way it is more correct to campare sums they pay to males and females for the same vacancy,1,NOT
in hollywood men make more money than women theres an article from forbes about it the main reason for the gap in other industries is that women are bad negociating their salaries the solution is simple salaries should be discussed openly talk to friends on the same field ask for advice make research and then negociate,3,NOT
give this woman a cookie,2,NOT
finally someone said it,1,NOT
so what is there to hate about this video why would you unlike it these are facts,2,NOT
my only complaint about this video is that the average is not the median its the mean someone please explain to me why all these videos and articles use median instead of mean when they are referring to the average the mean  average the median is the middle number it separates the top half of a group from the bottom half why would you use the median in this case why wouldnt you use the mean average surely some statistician could explain this,2,NOT
 literally what i always say,1,NOT
would have loved if they linked the studies,1,NOT
i recently said to a feminist instead of gender quotas why dont feminist just encourage men who are willing to step aside for equality to do so im sure alot of males out there would happily give up there job to play video games or watch sports all day allowing women to come in and fill the jobs those males leave behind she got so angry at the thought of males sitting home playing video games all day while women like her had to go out and work hard encouraging males in good positions who are willing to quit basically gives the same end result as gender quotas more males wont have those jobs and more females will but boy do feminist hate the thought of the men who lose those positions actually enjoying free time as unemployed people i dont believe in gender quotas or encouraging men to step aside for equality just knew the thought of a man being happy playing video games all day while women like her had to go to work would really piss off feminists and give me a good laugh,3,NOT
most jobs tell you what the pay scale is in the job posting this is before they know who is applying for the job regardless on whether you are a man or woman,2,NOT

this is the best thing ive seen all day,1,NOT

hi im wanting to research if the really is a wage gap between men and women i found this video and you state your sources oral but for the essay that is not going to be enough and also becuse its such a conteversal topic and the teacher migh get trigger ,2,NOT
im showing this to me mammy,2,NOT
omg you are the only smart woman to talk about this your actually right unlike the feminists,3,NOT
i remember people saying this since i was in th grade its  years removed theres still the myth of gender wage gap and taught in gender studies and other liberalpropagandist classes in accredited college campuses nationwide these people bought into alternative facts long before trump made it famous,3,NOT
if we use the same rules we can even fond out that women make more money than man i know more women able to afore buying houses than man,3,NOT
can someone give me studies that counter this the actual study reports not media or blogs note this is an actual request,1,NOT
lo que mas me sorprende del video es que la educacion infantil sea uno de los trabajos peores pagados,1,NOT
so heres the real question how come as a society we value the work that women do less than what men do sexism thats the answer,2,NOT
hey ladies im hiring garbage collectors full time hours at hr submit your resume to me today  insert sound of crickets chirping  oh okay youre not so unhappy with your job at the mall clothing store making minimum wage that youre ready to step up and earn more money doing harder work got it thats the gender pay gap explained in one sentence women wont do tough jobs and for that reason they dont get paid like men nor should they,5,ABU
congrats you have learned what most of us already knew,1,NOT
my question is why are jobs that women due more  pay less,2,NOT
lady i love you,1,NOT
im actually choosing my major this year and im going for the major that i like and not necessarily for the one that pays the most so are all the girls in my class however the boys are going for the majors that pay the most cause they need to have a good income if theyre gonna care for their family someday and you seriously dont expect them to earn more pathetic,3,NOT
mr prager did you get demonized for this video,2,NOT
dont worry feminist just dont care about facts especially in south korea,3,NOT

paid propaganda and manufactured lies,5,ABU
lol woman are so stupid for choosing careers that care for people and shit,6,ABU
i like how they choosed a female to host so we take it seriously since most women are obviously bias and stubborn on the subject,3,NOT
well heres the thing if my theoretical husband and i wanted to start a family it is more likely that i would be the one taking time off after the baby is born there is stigma that if a new mother doesnt take the time off for her baby she is considered a bad mom however if she does take the time off to care for her new born she is considered not hardworkingdedicated how is that fair i agree with what this is saying that the wage gap is a myth in the sense that if you do two different jobs with different pay then yes there is a gap but there are still ideologies that hurt women from going into fields like computer science etc for example i have a friend who works with computers and fixes them however she is always questioned by customers about if shes doing it right or if thats really the answer even though she is one of the top techs meanwhile a coworker who is male who is in a lower position is hardly questioned by customers about what hes doing so yeah the wage gap may not exist but there is still a stigma that prevents women from entering these fields or stigmas that give them a hard time in the fields,2,NOT
i thought that it was by average earnings by women and men and i argued about things such as choosing different paths and hours but because of this it seems that women make more considering how many women work full time,2,NOT
so basically there is a average pay gap because women mostly choose lower paying jobs on average than men,2,NOT
follow up question what factors might be influencing such unanimous choice if  of people choose something that is very suspicious for example imagine a political election with that kind of skewed result consequently the  difference is revealing of perhaps an inequity in treatment that cultivates these choices that presumably should be confronted at least considered and certainly not ignored,2,NOT
only problem ive seen is that women  not mothers dont get raises as often men but aside form that if women want equal pay for equal work stop having kids to a business kids are a burden that take you away from your job and making them money a working mom is not as valuable as a childless male or female or even a working father who takes little time off get over it you chose to have kids and the problems that come with them you cant expect to be paid the same as a person who rarely takes off and works on holidays and over time while you take off to spend time with your kids or take care of them if they are sick its just common sense,3,NOT
thank god somebody made a vid about this,1,NOT

not to be that guy but the infographic at  is misleading in that it equates the wage gap recalculated to  cents to the  cents that is the previously mentioned female median wage not the wage gap which in that case would be  cents did i miss something there or is it just an accident,2,NOT

a website says this is probably propaganda  im a male nurse i make less generally than female nurses most of the time and get my ass pinched all the time,2,NOT
of you look at overall averageof all jobs and all degrees men make more money than women because there are fewer women in higher paying jobs but if a man and a woman work the same job same shift and have the same degree work in the same stateprovincecity state and are equal in job positionex manager and manager they will have the same pay,2,NOT
okay so this video seems so far to make it sound like being a feminist is a bad thing i am a feminist in the way that i think people should be equal no matter what there gender and that yes there maybe some wrong info but doesnt mean there isnt a difference between the way men and women are treated i may be a bit confused so if you would like to explain to me how i am wrong or whatever in the comments nicely feel welcome to do so,1,NOT
well ill tell my jobs i work for private security where ill work as a bouncer for up to  an hour security escort for all kinds of stuff up to  an hour and to transfer prisoners riding in a van for hours with murders rapists and drug dealers inches away up to  an hour now how many women are gonna do these jobs where ive been beaten stabbed and shot multiple times because ive yet to see any,3,NOT

 is not the same as  both feminist and antifeminist are more concerned about promoting their narrative than the truth,3,NOT
stupid activist jerks infecting hte minds of millions of already dumb young people that there is systematic wage gap caused by an imaginary antiwoman agenda we are in a golden age of gender equality but theyd lie to you about it,5,ABU
christina hoff summers is a national treasure,1,NOT
its not the wage gap its the ambitions gap,3,NOT
i think any hypothesis about a subject including this one should be discussed openly and objectively what bothers me is the feeling i get from reading all the comments most of you think the problems that women who call themselves feminists talk about are not true most of the people who comment are very supportive of rigid gender lines and responsibilities and i dont label myself anything i am myself some people may call me a feminist but im a human being who is trying to express myself and freely be myself without hurting anyone the fact that i am a women should not exclude me from any profession it should not force me to be feminine it shouldnt force me to have children again i think most of the people who comment here would want all these things to restrict me or be denied to me its very disturbing,3,NOT
you opened this video up with misinformation the statistics are based on what women and men make on average per respective position meaning that the gap varies over different jobs etc but on average is on  cents not  if you were telling the truth you could have linked to credible sources in the comments,3,NOT
whos truth christina we all see truth through our own lens its a motherhood tax watch netflix series explained  why women are paid less episode same facts different truths,3,NOT
this is a surprising look i hadnt thought about how they determine the numbers before for some reason,1,NOT
i like how the first sentence is just logic,1,NOT
and now please push that into the heads of policy makers and politicians so we may somewhen in the far furute im realistic we start having equal rights on both sexes,2,NOT
i hate you prageru but this is a good video,3,NOT

please dont use prageru as a credible source they dont use facts just their opinions,2,NOT
i love watching your videos they are so hilarious and help us understand why the us is failing so much xd,2,NOT

every person with an iq higher than  gives facts on a topic leftist looks like you triggered my victim card,3,NOT
people just dont like women thats why not because it costs less also you cant just hire men or just women,3,NOT
another reason is that women take more time off this is especially true for younger women mostly because of pregnancy,2,NOT
men value personal time less and hours at work more,2,NOT
amazing this still has to be explained to people in ,2,NOT
there is a gender pay gap male heart surgeons earn far more than female nurses ,2,NOT
why is there a wage gap at all simple women make decisions that man cannot do women get pregnant men dont so they can continue to work unimpeded for the next  months even if they dont get pregnant women overall have more health concerns that take them away from work and another reason men make more is because various jobs often tend to use money to incentivize people to take them its why men dominate the careers that tend to expose oneself to unsanitary filthy disgusting conditions the most dangerous jobs in the nation are overwhelmingly male,3,NOT
it means that we need to redefine the problem women somehow find it difficult to rise to high paying jobs we should address that,2,NOT
but there is a wage gap,1,NOT

dont forget women are victims of men since century like black people for exemple so if the gap doesnt exist nice even if other studies show the opposite,1,NOT
but then these idiots come back with well the patriarchy keeps women from choosing what they want ,5,ABU
its exactly as she says about how being able to define the gender wage gap is hard to summerise when there are so many contributing factors to these causes of a wage gap other studies show evidence of the gap because of the areas they research the cause of the gap while other studies conclude that there is no gap because of where they focus their research and evidence on its very hard to come to a decision or view point when there are so many contradicting factors to consider,1,NOT
lol thats not really true she twists the data to show what she wants but you cant really expect her to present on wage gap while shes agaisnt feminism while i was working in service early college years i was doing basically nothing but was paid more than my female counterpart the problem with wage gap is that women have lower hourly wage than men this can of course change if youre manager and negotiate about your potential income but if youll come somewhere for some basic noschool position and theyll offer you less only because youre a women thats the problem,2,NOT
this is actually a gender gap because those numbers reveal that women in general tend to have a lower position than men in a work place women earn less even with a proper education and the same performance as their male colleagues,1,NOT

there are certain occupations which are not considered as suitable due to cultural norms these are the ones where women are underrepresented as per the cultural norms women are believed to be caring and tender this is one of the reasons why women occupy significant share in nursing primary teaching human resources how is this about an individuals choice its a much larger question of how society thinks of gender roles,1,NOT

facts are sexist,3,NOT
also theres a law about being underpaid and shit everyone must be paid equal no matter who they are or their backgorund if there was an actual wage gap women would be in most jobs men would have a harder time finding jobs cause they are expensive,3,NOT
one of the most ignorant videos ive come across this argument is incomplete and the explanation is fragmented this video tries to propagate the lie that gender wage gap is due to individual choice lets take responsibility for the sexism that discourages occupational mobility do women choose to have lower paying jobs recognize that opportunities for men and women are not equal which is reflected in the wage gap women are limited in the kind of jobs they can access because of access barriers in both education and employment tests are designed to be more difficult for women than men attitudinal barriers about gender roles prevent job mobility this video conveniently doesnt address systemic problems of oppression that affect the opportunities available to women,2,NOT
how can anyone deny this,2,NOT
there definitely is a wage gap,2,NOT

sure youre right about career choices but do you not think theres a reason that those tend to be the career paths chosen by the different sexes women are discouraged from taking the highest paying majors because of social conditioning to believe that its a male dominated field and that women should be carers first and foremost,2,NOT

i tried to show this to my mother whose a pretty hardcore feminist and she refuses to even watch it she called me a misogynistic idiot theyre so dug into their opinion that they dont believe the facts even if theyre right in front of them,2,NOT
well women are already expected to do stuff other than just te job men dont have that pressure why  patriarchy so lets teach or society to not be so hard on women and stop being assholes and let them do whatever the hell they want to without imposing stupid conditions ,3,NOT
and this is why the wage gap is more sexist towards men than women men are seen as the expendable workers who are expected to work or even give their own life to provide for women they are forced by society to take higher paying and more dangerous jobs while women either stay at home and live comfortably off of their husbands money or work in a comfortable low paying job men are seen as expendable workers who must respect and provide for women and women are seen as holy princesses who have to live their lives comfortably this is also why men arent allowed to hit women because women are the mens superiors and must be treated with respect and care its also why women have their feelings coddled and cared for when men are expected to never show their emotions women deserve to have their feelings cared for because theyre not expendable and no one gives a shit about mens emotions because they are expendable,3,NOT
glad i got this ad and not the opposite,1,NOT
only  seconds in and damn,2,NOT
although i believe the gender wage gap is bullshi and does not exist what is the proof that men are more willing to relocate more willing to ask for raises etc,2,NOT
well its equal between women and men because men do more and work and hours and different jobs that women dont usually work at therefor that makes it equal,3,NOT
i cant believe that we have had to make this video so many times people are idiots,3,NOT
im quite confused why would sjws get so bitchy when it is proven that the wage gap doesnt exist i know that most of them are whining like children about their other problems but i dont see the need to be whiny when proven that the discrimination of pay didnt exist,5,ABU
that myth is know debunked,1,NOT
if the wage gap was real companies would only be hiring woman its odd to think a company would hire someone that costs more money but does the same quality work,2,NOT

the propaganda in this video and almost all prageru vids is insane my wife has a masters in accounting and a cpa before she started working at a accounting firm she had worked as the accountant for  different business she was the accountant so she knew exactly what everyone was making since she had to do payroll at all  jobs women who held the same management positions as other male managers were paid anywhere from  to  less a year higher up the ladder it only got worse do not trust prageru they lie and never present any actual facts only ideals and opinions they think you should live by its a scam school,3,NOT
in the last  years wages for the super duper rich have gone up  wages for the middle class have been stagnant for  years while inflation has continued to skyrocket this bitch in the video is absolutely delusional,6,ABU
yes there is never married college educated full time working men who have never had children  are paid  less than their female counterparts you need to understand that lefties dont just lie they say the complete opposite of the truth,5,ABU
if i had a dollar for every gender id have ,3,NOT
this video is pretty accurate there is no gender pay wage gap in the workplace but that does not discount that it still exists due to societal sexism men and women may make the same amount in the same job but they are told from a younger age that those lower paying jobs are more likely to be a fit for them we are told to be teachers social workers and therapists while a man is often told he should be a doctor lawyer or scientist its not on the workplace besides that  cents which is still not good but forgivable but rather on raising our girls to believe that they can do whatever they want to do,1,NOT
there is  triggered feminazis on this video,5,ABU
ur the best,1,NOT
my teacher tries to shove this myth down the throat of my classmates and i honestly it gets my blood boiling,3,NOT
there is wage discrimination my wife has experienced gross wage discrimination working as a contractor for the county a man was hired as a contractor to perform the same tasks with the same credentials as her he was paid eighteen dollars an hour more he didnt work his way up negotiate for more this was his starting pay,1,NOT
but arent women taught from a young age to go into more nonstem majors you cant blame women for not making the right choice when theyre told from a young age they would be bad at it not to mention there are plenty of horror stories of sexism and sexual harassment which must be pretty daunting for any woman choosing to go into a male dominated field its the responsibility of men and women to be respectful and empower each other not be gatekeepers and stereotype based on stupid statistics,1,NOT
get your hate speech off of youtube get your hate speech off of youtube wipes sweat from brow and drinks from thermos,3,NOT
its true that theres no wage gap based on gender but why are jobs traditionally placed on women such as teaching valued less than jobs traditionally placed on men such as business shouldnt jobs such as education be valued more due to how important it is for a functioning society,1,NOT
and in any case who said that revenue should be split evenly across genders,3,NOT
this is good i like this we need more of this,1,NOT
 glaring issues one mathmatical and the other conceptual begining with the marh youre using the word median and average interchangeably wich skews your conclusion as they are not the same thing to show this differences ill use simple numbers if you have a data set a set of numbers representing value the numbers in this example are chosen to display the difference between between average and median that contains these  numbers   to find the average of these numbers you find the sum  and devide it by the amount of numbers  this average however does not account for the massive outlier a number far removed from the main grouping in the data set wich skews the data higher if you wanted the median of this data set you count inward from both sides to find the middle number with  the number with  numbers on each side of it wich is  in this case  though that difference seems small  and  are pretty close the numbers we used in this example are small and when you start comparing data sets and bring percentages into it the difference becomes bigger imagine we have a different data set lets call it set b and call our original set a and set b has an average of  and a median of  if we compare the averages we get a  different because  they are the same number however if you compare median you get a  different as  and  that difference is small with are numbers but when you have larger data sets like data on wages that percentage makes a difference and that difference between average and median can skew your conclusion wich is why all the citations of information in this video are incorrect because youre using studies that compare medians and studies that compare averages together and interchangeably and therefore reaching a not entirely incorrect but nevertheless fallacious conclusion now issue  a bit shorter you cite that  too paying jobs are primarily male and  lowest are mostly female and when accounting for this you get a very small wage gap however the comparison of the total averages yields a larger gapthis inherently means that more women work in lower paying jobs wich speaks to a larger sexism issue not with individual employers or even individual industries as youve shown the gaps with industry accounted for is small but can can meaning might indicate a larger issue that because if societal expectations women mostly go into certain fields fields that pay less than mostly male dominated fields congrats to making to the end hope this does something,2,NOT
 my mother has the same qualifications listed and she gets paid the same as men so yes there is not rlly a wage gap,3,NOT
why dont businesses hire only women like hiring people isnt already a resourceintensive expensive process and you think reducing the employee pool by half is an option have you ever worked,2,NOT
she also forgot this thing called the equal pay act from the s,2,NOT
quick question i often hear about workplace danger as one variable that would result in men earning more but dangerous jobs dont actually pay particularly well at least from what ive found how does this variable affect the wage gap,1,NOT
thank you for this everyone needed this to prove the feminists wrong,3,NOT
i told my sister and my best friend the wage gap didnt exist they laughed at me and said i was an idiot whos the idiot now the person who actually questions what they are told and looks into a topic or the person who blindly believes everything that they are told without a second thought,3,NOT
married man pay married woman pay this is a joke,3,NOT
i am a feminist i agree with everything in this video which is why if we want to see women on average earning the same as men on average referring to the opening statistic she cited then we need to encourage women to enter certain fields the top  paying majors what this video did not comment on were the reasons women are choosing not entering these fields if the true costs of a certain career are higher for women than for men then of course we will see unequal gender representation in said field by true costs i am referring to the emotional costs of being the lone women or the of facing constant rude comments can take on a person society has a long history of gender roles and it has been a very difficult process for people to breakdown these notions of womens work versus a mans work for example if women who want to become petroleum engineers not only have to obtain all the same degrees and experience as their male counterparts but also have to overcome social and emotional obstacles which men face to a much lesser degree because this field is already seen as a natural fit for men then of course women are not choosing to enter those fields because they wage they would earn does not cover all the costs associated with that career thus they way to close the gap between average female and average male earnings is to make adjustments at a societal level on how we work and interact with one another  attempting to make each professional field an equally valid option for both genders lastly in references to the idea that there is better pay for employees willing to work longer hours or keep more flexible hours the current trend of women choosing jobs or positions with more traditional working hours can be attributed to the fact that women still take on the majority of housework and child rearing responsibilities  so of course they cannot accept positions with irregular or extended hours thus if we want to see women changing the sort of hours they work and thus the level of pay they receive then we need to give men paternity leave and try to equally distribute the burdens or parenthood between the two parents assuming you are lucky enough to have two parents,1,NOT
oh boy  we definitely choose to take  cents less,2,NOT
thank god for a women doing this,1,NOT
 minutes and  seconds to prove the opposite of your point good job,3,NOT
ill take these facts on the chin for now but i would like to see references put either in the video or underneath it so i could look up the facts and quotes myself,2,NOT
and whilst the feminists are out protesting men are working,3,NOT
i like this woman,1,NOT
men will work harder chat less and are more resistant to stress that will also make money but if you give women same money regardless you simply lose money and eventually lose those male workers who will decide to find job elsewhere,5,ABU
to earn a living you must be of value to get a job you must qualify for what theyre paying you simple as that women have different priorities than men the label feminist is so overrated and even exploited by politicians and businesses when really its just grown women throwing tantrums in a glorified way im probably going to be attacked if i say this i dont care about feminism focus on your mind your intelligence not just the fact that you have a vagina,5,ABU
edgy as it may be but honestly we human should start selective breeding people with mental disorder like genderfluid whtathefuckkerry or feminazi should not be allowed to reproduce,7,ABU

this video is a godsend this should be a requirement in all schools to watch,1,NOT
totally missing the point here there is  a gender pay gap though smaller than  difference between men and women even with factors such as education level age race and job title in every country around the world i think the reason for this is more biological than social such as men naturally having more risktaking tendencies such as asking for promotions and women naturally having more caregiving tendencies such as devoting more of their time to household duties,2,NOT
sees title well no shit,1,NOT
dear god these statistics are refreshing i had tremendous skepticism that systemic sexism existed in our job market,1,NOT
feminists are weak woman that are secretly lesbian,5,ABU
almost every woman i know makes more than me ,2,NOT
i am missing something or should the pay gap just be determined on the pay men and women get for the same job if you get the median from both genders how is it going to be the same by this logic there is a  wage gap between asians and blacks in america that should be a outrage right,2,NOT
businesses dont hire only women because of discrimination in the old days women were sooooo underpaid but businesses believe men are more capable of doing the work which is why businesses dont hire only women even if there is a gap and they would be cheaper,2,NOT

this channel is not a university its a republican front,2,NOT
i actually have a personal story that could shed some light on the unexplained wage gap after calculations my mother was the gm of an advertising company and she had many agents working under but two stood out they both worked the same amount of hours and overtime they both had the same quality of work and had similar qualifications and contracts and one was a man the other a woman and they had both been working around a year and a half one day the woman discovered that the man mad about  percent more than her though they had the same position and bonuses when she came to my mother and asked about it she learned it wasnt because of sexism it was very simple the man asked for a raise and got it my mother admitted to the woman that if she had asked for a raise she would have gotten one but because she didnt the guy made more than her on his base salary this is very common in certain fields because men on average have more confidence in the workplace as such they have around a x more likelihood of asking for a raise or bonus the woman asked for it and she got it and when my mother was later promoted to senior vp of marketing the man got a promotion to gm why you may ask because he asked for the promotion first and my mother gave it to him as he was a member of the top  agents along with the woman the morale of the story is that this smaller wage gap can be explained in certain situations by workplace confidence it is your job to ask for a raise or promotion and not the employer to ask if you want one because confidence and decisiveness in the workplace can trump credentials almost  of the time i hope you can all learn from the womans mistake and use it forward in your career,2,NOT
damn that social work is definitely true i was one of  males in a class of  students ouch and i make very little ,1,NOT
feminists antivax and flat earthers seem to do the same thing purposely misinterpret info pick the only article that supports them even when theres  that say why they are wrong and try to pull the uneducated or look at these obviously fake statics and pretend they are right,3,NOT
what about pay gap in hollywood and every other film industry are actresses are not willing to work longer hours or are they less talented the career in hollywood is very high paying atleast for the leads so it is not an issue of bad choice by womenhow do you explain this,2,NOT
so i guess we can say that feminists are just lazy at finding a job or at anything,5,ABU
the earnings gap is one of the most hilarious public policy discussions of today because  i dont think the government should force women to go into fields solely because they pay more  i dont think the government should force women to work more hours than men to offset the difference in hours worked  i dont think the government should force women to make specific decisions in which job to take  which salary to accept  i dont think the government should force women to be unable to take time off from work for childcare  childbirth  i dont think the government should force women to demand higher pay over healthcare or other benefits,2,NOT
the argument of personal choices in my humble opinion is just trash she ignores that our personal choices are highly influenced by our experiences for example as a man ive been teached that i can do whatever i want if i try hard enough however i know tons of women who have been discouraged from the first time theyve failed doing something if every time you fail doing something someones tells you not to try again or that you cant do that you are not going to even try making personal choices that involve being surrounded by men that probably are going to feel better than you and are going to make you feel like youre worse than them you have to take in account the social reality in which you live when youre analizing this you cant take for granted that all men and women make their choices in the same situation because society is not the same for men and women,2,NOT
wow i actually learned a lot from this i didnt know what to believe with this topic so thank you,1,NOT
shows how statistics are meaningless without context,2,NOT
men are paid more because they normally have to pay taxes and bills for their families but females are not really expected to pay taxes and bills men also are expected to work hard and longer but women are not expected to do so this also depends on how the genders have done based on quality and positive effects on their companies so overall i think men should be paid more,5,ABU
very well said,1,NOT
good video in a long time,1,NOT
this is a logical argument oh so thats why extreme feminists so hear this,3,NOT
because why then would i hire men fair point,2,NOT
love how people still argue with facts,2,NOT
there is no wage gap,2,NOT
logic is to liberals as garlic is to vampires its so easy to figure out where people get their ridiculous numbers from but it takes a video that they still wont accept to break it down i want to see the pay scale chart in black in white that says a woman will make less at the same job same company same location for the same position did you know that a woman who is an illegal immigrant makes less than the average white maleim done cradling liberals heads trying to explain this shit im done talking they cant be saved,3,NOT
exactly i should show this to my friend,1,NOT
and now find a sledgehammer large enough to pound that piece of logic into a feminist stupid head good luck ,5,ABU
the mens bags of money were bigger in the thumbnail,2,NOT
im a woman and find this whole concept really interesting i cant understand why some people get all steamed up over it,1,NOT
this video doesnt really address what the lefties argument really is its kinda dishonest,2,NOT
i would like to point out that those individual choices are affected by sexism and gender roles women are dissuaded from going into manly careers where they earn more because theyd be the only women in that workplace and people tell them its not a womans job yes its technically individual choice but its a highly railroaded choice,1,NOT
how does this have dislikes,2,NOT
i dont get what she means when she first says that when you account for different choices women and men make the wage gap shinks to  c and than she says that this gap that does exist is again due to differnt choices that doesnt really make sence does it,2,NOT
even though this video was told by a leftwing pansexual and black person feminists and sjws would still find something that is biased about it you cant win this fight only hope that human evolution will find a way to eradicate these imbeciles in the future,5,ABU
thank you for all the work and logic ,1,NOT
wamen should be in the kichen where they belong,6,ABU
so why is it that both of my parents work at the same job both came in at the same week and my dad got more thats weird when you compare it to the video hmmmmmmmmm,2,NOT
finally someone said the true,1,NOT
wage gap is a completely misleading and false term its absurd it should actually be called income gap income factors in different working hours different professions and pay rates nearly all the variables whereas wage is just too simplistic and focuses on just one variable the amoutn of money someone makes for  hour of their labour,1,NOT
men are more likely to work longer hours without advance notice  what im not a man lol,2,NOT
oh and on the myth on wages of men and women i wonder maybe it because women are far more vain that men and find it easier to lie to get more money maybe just maybe its because women are far more greedy than men i dont see boys or men running off to go buy  dollar pair of pants from the buckle or boys telling a lie about how much prom coast so that their so called trusting girls can take back their prom dress that her and her mother picked out to get a more expensive one on top of a more tramp looking one on top of that or how they will threaten a manager that she will sue them for discrimination if he doesnt giver her a promotion or a pay raise hell ask jerry springer or the view they seem to be demoralizing americans pretty well im sure they could answer that question,6,ABU
i really want to show my mom this video but she would probably hate me for it,2,NOT
why do we not have a law that states that all old crones with dry vaginas are worthless and should forfeit their jobs to all the men maybe the worthless vagina should just shut up and buy some progesterone cream why did prader u waste their money on this stupid female why is she even talking doesnt she know shes worthless after the age of  moisten your dry menopausal vagina and go home and save prader u some money and stop talking because women should be seen and not heard and no one wants to see you,7,ABU
she said median but its mean,2,NOT
why median wage what is the mean wage,2,NOT
full of bs speech of a female host just show how cowardness and hypocrisy u r i am biologically male i know that women on work would have stealthy discriminations and glass ceiling simply they are female and those traditional sense confines them ie menstruation pregnancy workload stereotyped recognition different cognitive capabilities etc this is just a nicely dodge and quibble for those sexists and male supremacists,3,NOT
this video is right every social scientist and average citiezen knows that men a women have diferent choices however women are educated to perform service jobs while men are educated to perform leadership and scientific jobs boys are expected to be good at math while girls are expected to be good at cooking and take care of childrens a single father can not be on guard  but that is statistically irrelevant because they are the minority most single parents are mothers there is a gender gap thats why there is a wage gap its not magic the worst thing is that this gender gap is harmful for women who want to be professionally and economically independent as well as for men tired of gold diggers i recognize the ability to use data but this conservative propaganda does nothing but misinform people taking into account the decadent educational system to be a first world country that you have there in the united states with fancy titles and lousy argumentation,3,NOT
women using marriagedivorce and children for unearned entitlements of alimony and child support makes prostitution look like an honorable occupation men are tragically emotionally abused and financially raped by women dishonoring sanctity of marriage for sport,6,ABU
that little gap can only be explained by blaming a man not,2,NOT
the myth comes from not understanding a basic statistic,2,NOT
i can tell you why there is a minor wage gap women dont know how to negotiate like jordan peterson says women are more agreeable those that arent make more money they need to learn how to reject offers and fight as hard as men do to make as much as they can,5,ABU
wives make  cents for every husbands dollar wife then takes husbands dollar,2,NOT
somebody school me because i must not quite be getting all the nuances presented or maybe i dont have an understanding of how statistics work so the video is titled no gender wage gap but at  theres still a  difference then she says a few seconds later that a wage gap does indeed exist she then says that its due to these different factors but i was under the assumptionand maybe wrongly so that all those factors was what brought the gap down for  to  in the first place or is or a relatively close number have some sort of statistical significance eg in some sort of allowableinsignificantdeviation kind of way point being would it be more appropriate for a feminist to say something along the lines of fight for the ,1,NOT

i agree in most cases two people rarely get paid for the same work in the organization that i work for same for most they use pay ranges depending on your experience education etc you are made an offer you can then negotiate for more pay or just take it so i guarantee there are women that make more than me with the same pay grade and vice versa,1,NOT
i love you christina but im not loving that red lipstick girl it doesnt suit your look,3,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense would make a great gif,1,NOT
i would have spent another minute and explaine that having these choices is a good thing for women an alternative that requires government intrusion to remedy perceived discrepancies would force women to work longer house perform more dangerous jobs etc that they may not want in the end this seems a nonissue  time to move on unless youre fund raising nice video,1,NOT
smashed that like button so hard it broke,1,NOT
there is probably still some left over wage gap from previous generations where men have more experience and are the older segment of the labor force that earns more but the strongest argument is the first argument capitalism cant afford to be racist or sexist or else someone would have a company that only hired women and would have  more profits,1,NOT
the fact that we still have to talk about this,2,NOT
thank you thank you thank you oh thank you god someone is telling the truth out loud at last,1,NOT
actually women can face a lot of discrimination in certain jobs so shut up becky,3,NOT
there is still a wage gap for like to like jobs but based on job choice a marginal    still exists between male and female but i do take umbrage at men working harder and longer as a nurse and i do not think men are more dedicated or intelligible than women my wife and i receive old age pensions but i get more than her so even the government pays less to females all in all i have my skills and my wife has hers but she gets a work pension higher than mine i was a electro mechanical engineer and she a telephonist you can not average wages out as stated in this video all circumstances differ for each person i believe women are still behind in the pay structure,2,NOT
whats so ugly about the left is even if they accept these stats and that the wage gap is due to choices women make they insist women are making the wrong choices and run countless sjw ads like microsoft and audi encouraging women to forget about having kids or getting married going to work most likely for some guy,3,NOT
pay social workers and counselors what theyre worth is what youre saying,2,NOT

the other thing about the wage gap is they say that white women make  cents for every mans dollar and then later on they say something about black or latino women making  cents for every dollar is this then suggesting that the wage gap is also racist when was the first time you ever heard a feminist bring this up if blacklatino women are earning less than white women,2,NOT

wow perspective changed,1,NOT
the most likely reason the current wage gap exists is because women tend to be the dominant caretaker of children thus having less flexible schedules,1,NOT
this is bs it exists and i have seen it first hand,3,NOT
men are more willing and able to work long hours without advanced notice and then there are some feminists who want to take sleep breaks at work while claiming there is a wage gap,3,NOT
that was a good video,1,NOT
women and men have the same rights in the western world it is all about the choices we make most women choose easier career paths and work less hours to raise children that is their own choice there is nothing wrong about it in the west men and women also share home care duties and raise children together in the western world job vacancies are offered to women and men at the same wage most men are more flexible and work long hours that is why they can make more money feminists hate independent women and use them to escalate in politics and in the company they are selfish beings feminists detest men but use them they want to share the partners bank account to also spend his salary and not happy with that they claim half of the mans assets and a pension when they divorce strong independent women never stop educating themselves overcoming bad times working hard being responsible and fair with men strong women do not fall into feminists fallacies there is not such a gender wage gap strong women respect men and women alike because independent women look far beyond the genre real women praise the individual feminists created a women day only aka discriminating men how low this is would feminists feel happy if men declare a day only for themselves lets stop with this game,6,ABU
i love so much i have explained this a thousand times again i love,1,NOT
this is a complex issue yes gender discrimination happens and yes women are probably paid less than a man because of their sex however there are many things that contribute to the  for a  a man makes some of it is measurable such as education but some of it you cant measure the best way is to take a company with roughly the same experience same college education and than performance indicators to indicate if their is a true gender income inequality right wing will tell you it doesnt exist left will tell you it does but how many will admit its somewhere in the middle its probably not nearly as bad as the left portrays but it does exist probably in the tiniest amount,2,NOT
wait how would hiring women reduce costs by nearly a quarter that would require employment to be  of the costs and the wage gap to be at  cents to every dollar a man makes yet employment only covers a portion of costs and the wage gap is stated to be at  cents anyone agree or disagree with me on this i agree with the view on the wage gap held in the video but i felt this was a mistake,2,NOT
thank you for telling the truth this fake wage gap is constantly used to justify hatred against men whats funny is as ms sommers says it doesnt even make any mathematicalbusiness sense,2,NOT

women have more rights then men and they scream oppression they get away with so much more ik men r idiots but a women could hit a man and they wont get punished for it but if a guy hits a women they get put in jail for assault just bc men r stronger doesnt mean were all misogynistic and we always beat women up and rape them men get raped it doesnt happen very often but it happens the problem with feminists is that they accuse all men of being assholes and were fking not my sister says all guys want the same thing and that is not true at all,3,NOT
lets also mention that women are generally more expensive when it comes to medical care i go to the doctor once a year for my physical my wife goes several times a year for lady plumbing reasons alone its even more once they get pregnant some even get paid maternity leave no hate just reality,3,NOT
if pharmaceutiaal science is only  male than it is  female than that makes it a female dominated field by ,1,NOT
finally some common sense,1,NOT
im a junior in high school and my history teacher recently showed us a cnn video about the wage gap i almost walked out,2,NOT
most women prefer to date men who make more than them does that factor in at all,3,NOT
yes it is true that women only make  cents for every dollar a man makes but thats not fair because then the man is only left with ,3,NOT
i showed this to my teacher and she said that is not true like  times,2,NOT
i wish all women were as smart as you,3,NOT
wow for the first time prager u is correct and not just right wing propagandabut its wrong to say that only the left says that when even conservatives and the right have also said that argument tooso yea even in some careers women earn more than men,2,NOT
i wish instead she had said this isnt sexism its capitalism,1,NOT
perfectly presented madame kudos ms summers,1,NOT
i love you so much for clearing this up my head hurts from hearing people saying its a thing so many times ,1,NOT
bbc still do it its true,2,NOT
best explanation of the fake gender wage gap im so glad i continued to watch this since it was merely an ad on another video its all spot on thank you for sharing,1,NOT
thanks for saying this the dislikes are salty sjws,3,NOT
oh my god thank you for making this a bout time someone explained this to people,1,NOT
the statistics are unbiased but the interpretation of them is not,1,NOT
lmao yeah take that feminazis they probably bootyhurt,6,ABU
good video but i have the feeling it is important to contrast some points  until recently women didnt have the same access to the education or leading position as men actually only one think remained from that period the idea that women are in charge of the children more than men this way of thinking creates a lot of problem because entering in trouble with going up the career ladders for women as a woman you are really more likely to be less available for your job than men  again because men have been used to occupate leader positions men are still now doing more studies related to this women on the contrary will do study according to the image built given to her linked to their housing task listen take care and so on explaining why they are more often following those studies to conclude i would say that facts presented in that video are true but i think we still need to change the way we see women in the society in my opinion it just cannot be denied that this salary gap is not directly wanted anymore but still due to a wrong old patriarchal way of thinking,1,NOT
your first question in your video is easily answered you cant only higher  gender its discrimination,2,NOT
this video was a long time in the making,1,NOT
there is no wage gap  sincerely an avid feminist,1,NOT
the guy at the end sounded like the toefl instructions guy,2,NOT
i want to see the statistics all brand new surgeon doctors of salary their first year male and female compare that and let see different we need to see form the same job same time experience in that job field and time with that company,2,NOT
the wage gap does exist men earn more than women look at any statistic and it will tell you that and you cant deny it because it is a proven fact but saying that its because of the patriarchy and this and that and blah blah blah is absolute hogwash,2,NOT
in other words men work harder and are more motivated to do their job,3,NOT
women are also knocking senseless the graphic design field as we speak my teachermale was rightfully concerned about the competition that awaits him in a few years,2,NOT
 feminists refuse to believe the truth,3,NOT
when there are indisputable facts already out there that the wage gap is very real ,2,NOT
well if you go on a boat trip with your coworkers and then the boat sinks all men would be left to die but the women would be saved maybe thats enough for the wage gap question,3,NOT
my experience with private tutoring in math and science shows women make hour and men hr demand is much higher for female tutors,2,NOT
i am so glad this was made,1,NOT
so thats how the wage gap was calculated they completely forgot to add all the variables to the equation like part time time off and types of jobs,2,NOT
anyone else looking for triggered feminists,3,NOT
freakonomics did a better job of exploring this topic and coming to the same conclusion women are more likely to work less and stop working to nurture either kids and or help elderly women are more nurturing and that makes us super stars in my book im so glad women are on the planet,2,NOT
you are poor because you want to if you work hard instead of complaining you will get far be humble and give your best dont be a crybaby,3,NOT
i like this women,1,NOT
women at my work get more hours than i do and make a dollar more,2,NOT
i have been waiting for this video for so long,1,NOT
what is this shit,5,ABU
so the simple answer is that men on average are willing to work harder,3,NOT
i showed this to my feminist classmate to convince her and she just got so pissed at all the points that were made in this video,2,NOT
i enjoyed the video and im not trying to be provocative but i have  sincere remarksquestions  individual choices happen in a context saying that men are more able than women to work longer hours or be on call doesnt take into account power relationships or cultural backgrounds eg i have a female friend who was offered a big promotion at he accountants office she almost didnt take it because it meant she wouldnt be able to be home for diner and she was afraid her husband wouldnt be able to cook and take care of the kids as it turned out he wasnt and she wakes up earlier every morning to cook dinner so that he just has to warm it up in this case if she had refused the job i totally agree that it would be absurd to say that the company was sexist but it seems as absurd to completely discard any type of sexism in the choices that some women make  how can we interpret the correlation between feminization of an occupation and lower wages in europe  years ago most medical doctors and academics were male now its shifting over and there are many more females in these occupations at the same time we notice that global wages for both men and women are in average  lower than what they used to be in those fields do you think it is merely a coincidence,2,NOT
whoever did her make up did a great job i loved it it brought up her beautiful features,1,NOT
funny how they make less and also manage to spend more than men really makes you think,3,NOT
christina is a babe,1,NOT
in the netherlands young women actually make more money as young men but this is because more women have a education,2,NOT
i had to write a essay on why feminism is true and how women make less i almost just left my class,2,NOT
feminists should stfu,5,ABU
there are only two genders and there is no gender wage gap thats the true,3,NOT
what the idea that women make  cents on the dollar less than men is false shocker,2,NOT
thank you for this video feminists are insane and want the upper hand but just want everything handed to them,5,ABU
anecdote women often choose aspects of a job that dont have anything to do with pay for example my boss is a single mother who is now a department head at my small company she used to hold another lower paying position she is still being paid at the scale of that lower position even though shes been dept head for  years she knows that if she left she could make considerably more elsewhere why does she stay because she is allowed to pretty much make her own schedule from day to day and to telecommute when she feels like it without even asking permission i dont think there has been a single day where she was here when i arrived and only took a one hour lunch and was here when i left her child has a million extracurricular activities and she can attend to all of them this may be an extreme example but women make these sorts of tradeoffs more often than men and its because they want to,2,NOT
i cant believe someone would create such a biased video without addressing any of the real factors women may choose to work other jobs because they dont have a choice they dont want to endure the stress of putting up with harassment in jobs that are more suitable for men their husbands expect them to take care of their children therefore not giving them any other choice but to stay at home and imagine being a woman and part of another minority group you will be facing a lot of social barriers videos like these will not change the social structure that has been created over generations so please review your work before making such a biased and misleading video,2,NOT
thank god for this video finally i wont be seen as sexist towards women who im simply attempting to deliver a simple message to this should be shown in schools to prevent young women to grow up in a sexist manner towards malesi hope this will go viral this woman is a hero,2,NOT
i bet a lot of women got upset by learning the truth because now they cant play the victim card and have nothing to complain about,3,NOT
ive never seen a video like this that goes into detail and shows how the wage gap is actually real i wonder why that is,2,NOT
honestly this whole thing is annoying even my teachers and im in th grade are saying that the wage gap is a thing cant wait to show them this thanks prageru,2,NOT
what are some negatives to this study because i feel like this is arguing for one position,1,NOT
this is brilliant,1,NOT
wow thanks for this info i never knew the truth,1,NOT
those who claim that for the same work women are paid  cents on the dollar compared to man in the other hand are not merely bad at math but at telling the truth bam give this woman an award,1,NOT
also its illegal to pay a woman less so theres that too,2,NOT
when it comes down to it it is society tell me this would you want a woman to work as an aerospace engineer or a chemical engineer or any high paying engineer probably no in society its not easy for a woman to get those jobs because of their gender and people tell them women cant do this or cant do that dude we have never even had a woman president women and men are different and men are considered the more hard working gender but there are plenty of hard working women as well and its not about wage gap its more about discrimination,1,NOT
and then you have to boneheads trying to push women into higher paying educations like engineering because they seem to think only those kinds of educations need to be  while none of them should necessarily be ,3,NOT
there is too much truth and logic in this video that it offends me and i need to march,2,NOT
isnt it also illegal to pay people differently based on sex arent female porn stars and models way better paid than men i mean there are no male supermodels,2,NOT
the title says there is no gender wage gap then it goes on to explain there is indeed a wage gap smh,2,NOT
why are all of you so angry at feminists who protest like for one century or even less whereas men were generally dominating for the rest of human history there are exaggerations but some feminists might overreact to be heard by those sceptics and not because they want to exterminate men antifeminists are as well overhappy to see this video as possible evidence that feminists are wrong,2,NOT
what about modelling industry feminists female models earnings dwarf their male counterparts earnings well feminists ignore the truth conveniently,3,NOT
yea im only  and a male and i plan to be the ceo of my own tourist trap in japan my sister fashionz,2,NOT
she got the point dont they want to be profitable or they are just bad at math,1,NOT
i blame birth control theyre not ovulating anymore want effeminate men and get into community organizing instead of propagating the species you dont see this shit in countries where the people arent wacked out on hormones and meds,5,ABU
all these videos exposing the wage gap all seem to be missing the most important factor which is truth that even if after recalculating the gap we came up to  then there is no need to further justify that this  has reasons why can we not be rational and accept that this  or even  out of it is due to discrimination which we all know exist on some level and also we all need to accept the fact that this type of discrimination is not the bad kind as men are naturally better at ceo and managing positions then women which is even reflected by the fact that over  of female business owners employ a male to run it for them so overall it doesnt matter how big the gap actually is because it can all be boiled down to who is naturally better and not because of gender discrimination,5,ABU
femenists always wanna blame men for their failures,3,NOT
a woman in america makes about x as much money for the same job i do in hungary and about x as much as someone in the poor regions of africaagain for the same job so yea just keep whining feminists you dont even realize how lucky you are,3,NOT
like when maddox said it two years ago but with more credibility when it is a woman saying it,1,NOT
so there is a wage gap its just much smaller than people advertise and it relates to a variety of thing that are much more complex than just gender and sexism,1,NOT
ms sommers youre absolutly correct love you d,1,NOT
afinal quem  a alma santa que legenda esses videos   valeu cara ,1,NOT
no one gets to be right all the time that being said let us pretend for a minute that a job interview is happening where the choice has not already been made about who will be getting the job long before the first interview was even held because some of the same qualities which men use to get ahead in business are discouraged in women within the business environment women do not have the same bargaining power over wages which men have during an interview for a new job the interviewer does not ever offer up front the maximum amount of money that the business has set aside which they can afford to pay the new employee men can bargain more from a position of strength to get that higher wage because this behavior is acceptable for men if a woman ever wants to be guaranteed she will be paid what is right for her skills education level and qualifications then she has to start her own business ladies christy wright has started a program called business boutique which is all about teaching women how to start and run their own business google her online for more information here is your way to get paid what you want hire who you want and set their wages fairly i hope you compete some of these other businesses right out of business,2,NOT

i feel like the girls without testosterone should at least get a head start even if its  second,1,NOT
even with  years of hormone therapy they will have larger lung capacity more muscle mass more power they are male regardless of hormone therapy regardless of surgery regardless of anything a steer that has his testicles removed at a week of age is still stronger that a heifer a gelding that had his testicle removed is still usually more powerful than a mare it is biology and nothing is not going to change that,1,NOT

im a transsexual female even castrated i have an unfair advantage they shouldnt be allowed to compete against the other girls fact is they wont beat the boys though if they are castrated,1,NOT
they should compete against men they are not girls they are boys,3,NOT
im surprised that schools are violating some of the personalprivacy rights of the students so transgender females or transgender males can feel good about themselves are the state governments in on this and is the federal government in on this how do natural born female students in general feel about sharing washroom and locker rooms with transgender females when i was a teenagers i didnt want to take off my clothes in front of other females it made me very uncomfortable i remember either changing into gym clothes in the bathroom stalls or waiting for all of the girls to leave before changing into gym clothes i could imagine transgender females trying to get a sneak peek of a natural born females body so they can know how they want their bodies to look if they decide to get surgeries to become more female in the future if i was growing up now and was in high school and i even glimpse a transgender girl just checking me out for those purpose because i know im being watched by any girl i would totally take a f in gym and skip it and stay in detention this is how shy i was in school i know there are still females who are like me growing up in this day and time whose loving them and protecting their rightsprivacy i hope their loving parents and the same school board that are protecting these two i think all people should have equal rights i just dont think people should just impose themselves on others based on what they feel or think i think we should all respect each other but i feel some people feelings and rights are being violated so others can feel better about themselves we all need to learn to love ourselves regardless of how we look on the outside,1,NOT

trisha is a mess and i cant believe the way that she is belittling the transgender community for likes im a cis woman and a huge lgbtqa ally and i am so outraged at this,3,NOT
i personally think she really does have identity issues sorry i know issues doesnt sound right but i cant think of the right word i think we need to come at her more gently because its so clear that trisha has so many different problems and i do believe that shes actually working hard to change herself but theres so much going on and she just wants to belong maybe shes not trans but shes very much confused i dont think she was doing this just for money she is a very confused and damaged person that needs to really focus on herself and people need to cut her some slack,1,NOT
i think trisha is just confused in general shes addicted to pills shes done coke and meth and she drinks drinking isnt that bad but she said she binge drinks which isnt normal or healthy behavior the concoction of shit shes on is probably messing with her chemical balances in her head and she is trying to rationalize how she feels but trying to identify a certain way it isnt right and im not defending her its just way deeper than being trans i dont think she even understands what it means im not trans but i understand what trans people go through and how they dont feel like theyre in the right body trisha doesnt seem to have a problem with that shes just confused her video was bizarre and i wonder if she was high on pills in a lot of her crazy rambling videos shes high so i dont see this as making any kind of sense lol,3,NOT

i have a genuine question im not trying to offend anyone and i honestly wholeheartedly mean no harm but as someone who doesnt know anything about transgender and all of that im learning now i have many questions but one is left unanswered why do transgender people keep saying they are transgender i get that theyve been through so much and its a journey but why not just say im a femalemale honest question i swear dont hate me just educate me please,1,NOT

trisha is notorious for trolling and trolling well shes very convincing i think this is just another example of her working her talent for lying to the internet lol honestly the real problem is the people who are actually like this theyre the ones who are pushing back a movement theyre the ones who are making a real mockery of the trans movement trisha is just a troll making money on peoples inability to realize shes lying no reason to make a big deal out of it imo  the transtrenders are the ones we should be mad about,1,NOT

how does a man know he feels like and therefore wants to be a woman how does he know what a female feeling feels like asking a man to describe female feelings is like asking a blind person to describe color whats the perceived difference between male and female feelings anyway if we can agree that theres no definition on feelings and their connection to your biological sex is it about the physical manifestation of gender do trans men just want their own boobs and vagina to play with and to go into womens toilets are they homosexuals that cant face reality and believe finding men attractive must make them women im interested to learn,1,NOT

its disgusting how movements are hijacked by those who want attention people who never felt anything wrong with their identity or whats between their legs feel a sense of validation and special treatment by their peers when they come out being trans is hard people look at you like youre a freak its way harder to get a job and youre ostracised by your family in most cases i love and support anyone who legitimately feels theyve been born in the wrong body its an awful feeling but its also just a medical disorder individuals who make their personality around their medical records are like mothers who think having children makes them interesting its not that important it should be a minuscule aspect of who you are and the world does not need to know,1,NOT

ngl shame on you for neglecting her opinion you cant just trash and decline how she does feel inside whether it makes since to many or not her trying to come out to the world isnt easy people should stay in their own lane including you because you cant understand how shes feeling i understand you most likely have different feelings that led you to your transition but honestly back off be understanding for her your video should seriously be taken down,2,NOT

honestly i dont think shes trans but she definitely is going through some sort of identity crisis abd i think shes trying to figure out whats going on in her head which is fine to do but she should not be public about it without knowing for sure if shes trans or not and all of her wild ideas of herself she just shouldnt be so open abiut that stuff on the internet bc is can hurt her and others,2,NOT

i dont get the hate from the usual subjects according to their standards trisha is trans and we must accept that despite her not making any effort to transition if she claims that she is trans or any other gender identity that is obviously the only thing that matters and we have to play along with that so as to not trigger an instance of dysphoria otherwise we are obviously being transphobic at least gigi is being principled by playing along because the rest of the left sure isnt lmao,1,NOT

ive been waiting for this vid with baited breathyou did not disappoint ,1,NOT
yeah i can explain this pretty simply actually ive seen one of her vids where she says that shes been diagnosed at borderline i am borderline also let me just say that this is her very obviously going off the rails for whatever reasons she has bpd is something that requires a life of upkeep its on the narcissistic spectrum she obviously hasnt been able to take care of herself appropriately and is now giving in to one of the symptoms which is basically that you feel like your core identity is completely malleable its an identity crisis on steroids and shes trying to get back in touch with herself but shes going in the opposite direction to where she should be gigi probably got an earful from trish and likely isnt so sure about it but wants to support her friend trish was talking a lot about her ex if a borderline person is coming out of a good ol dumping thats when the abandonment issues can kick in this might be what that looks like for her questioning her identity because it wasnt good enough for someone and rebounding into a marriage,1,NOT

i guess im a transgender gay man because i lounge looking like a bum more than i dress up  id understand if she was trying to say she is gender fluid but all her reasonings are not even validbeing trans or even genderfluid has nothing to do with who youre attracted to nor does it have anything to do with gender stereotypes,1,NOT
you should do a skincaremakeup routine video you are glowinggg,1,NOT
i cant tell whether shes seriously mentally fucked up  delusional or if shes just a serious troll for attention and is desperate for views either way shes definitely seperated from reality big time,3,NOT
i like purple and have long hair clearly im a transwoman,1,NOT
i support whatever the fuck people wanna be but just because you dress down or dress up it doesnt change who you are its common to not dress up everyday either its a everyday normal thing it means nothing but comfort or style that you may want to wear then and there i dont wear makeup everyday i try to just do my eyebrows or lashes before i leave the door thats it i try to dress up nicely for the most part but if i leave looking under dressed so what no one truly gives a shit and who cares if youre comfortable nothing to do with anything else,1,NOT
the fact that blaire eats chickfila ,1,NOT
i will mourn those  brain cells with you,1,NOT
somethings seriously wrong wit her she is extremely insecure in herself and doesnt know how to deal wit that she sayin she black a chicken nughet lesbian now she trans bruhh in all honestly i hope she gets serious help cuz this seem like a cry for help at this point i dont want to wake up one day and hear somethin tragic happend to her and it was to late look at etika ppl clowned him not realizing he needed genuine help i think she started out trollin but i think now she really is spiraling,2,NOT
anyone else think this clearly shows that trisha has no friends she can talk with and get other perspectives,1,NOT
 exists all forms of logic ight imma head out,1,NOT
i like how she has to title it female to male because everyone is gonna say to themselves ah that explains it,1,NOT
its problematic for young people when people post this crap when i was a young woman i didnt understand being an aromantic asexual  just that i didnt want to date the guys that asked me out i liked short haircuts and doc martens and the whole punk look in general i didnt really wear any makeup until i was in my early s if i had seen all this nonsense at that time i would have been questioning whether i was transgender becasue they equate being a girl that wears short hair as male to female transgender or gender fluid because every once in a while you do your eyebrows and wear mascara its not just annoying its confusing for people who are really trying to figure things out when my brother was in kindergarten they read cinderella to his class he waved his hand and said when i grow up i hope i have a pretty dress like hers why because my brother is an attention hound and went for the laugh at any opportunity they called my mother in for a talk which was stupid but if it happened now with all of this bs he would be called transgender and someone would be trying to give him hormones,1,NOT
 i act like a dude  of the time and im not gay or trans or anything and would never claim to be lol im just being me why do people have to push themselves into marginalized groups to feel better about themselves its really weird,1,NOT
i genuinely think trish is confused and i honestly think shes gender fluid i hope the best for her,1,NOT

trisha is like playing pokemon with labels she has to catch them all shes claimed to be gay bisexual transgender a drug addict and suffers from every mental illness that exists pathetic,5,ABU
i totally agree with you on the trisha topic but i guess its okay for sam smith to come out as nonbinary i believe in nonbinary being a thing i dont believe in genderfluid astrogender or anything crazy like that but when a person is trans and cant identify with being either male or female i believe its okay for them if it fits them to call themselves okay english is not my foreign language is themselves with v correct nonbinary if thats what makes you feel euphoric and eases your dysphoria hell yes go for it and with sam smith i just hope we have a positive example of a nonbinary person i just hope for some other representations than those crazy astrogender transtrender,1,NOT
thats one chick i wanna stay away from,1,NOT
pause at exactly ,1,NOT
i dont care much for most girly stuff but im still a female ,1,NOT
i love gay guysbecause i can borrow her clothezlol,1,NOT

ill often wonder if this chick trisha is just a really good actress and thinks of ways to troll youtube and i think that this is not the issue to be trolling about,1,NOT
if you watch her other videos its obvious shes going through some kind of mental breakdown there was a video of her literally rhyming about having boobs so i wouldnt take her video so seriously i think she needs help,3,NOT
ok so if she wants to be a gay man can we just afford her this status then as like a peace offering or something,1,NOT

i quit watching and supporting trisha a long time ago she is nothing but a drama queen and an attention whore,5,ABU
she is about as trans as my straight basic bitch white self is  i literally hate people like her because it does create this mockery of people i know who have goneare going through the struggles of transitioning and it just sucks that shes profiting off of it why is the internet not flipping out over this,3,NOT
talk about grasping at straws trisha just needs to go back to her other life style where she belongs because this isnt it shes a hot mess that like i said just needs to go shes disgusting with this,5,ABU
trisha makes these videos because they get her attention and she knows she will get away with it any other person wouldve been cancelled but since its trisha and shes been problematic from the beginning of her yt career it is expected from her and people give her a pass anyway after acting offended for maybe a week and a half,2,NOT
ima gay man bitch no stopgetsomehelp,3,NOT
ur sucha betch blair,5,ABU
hey blaire im not a constant viewer of your channel but i saw some of your videos and find your opinions quite interesting i dont agree with all of them but hey thats the joy of conversations xd theres one thing in particular i always find puzzling when hearing peoples opinion on the matter and that matter would be men and woman are biologically different especially when it comes to the malefemale brain that is what i believe not based on studies but what i consider common sense each sex has its own good and bad attributes in varying portions and there are people now opposing the idea that there are differences between the two sex however if there is no difference that would contradict a lot of the base argument for their topics if men and woman are the same why make a big deal out of the first female insert job here it was because before women where expected to have overcome bigger hardships that it seemed like a breakthrough to get into male dominant positions if theres no male and female characteristics why do you wish for a female president if theres no difference why is it about time you get one that whole idea is based on the expectation that a woman wouldnt be as cruel as a man and more levelheaded in stressful situations equipping her with positive female traits this contradiction just seems quite obvious and blatntly ignored by those claiming absolute unity of manwoman i would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps other commenters to get some ideas from different perspectives  btw im neither here or there on this matter i find labels nonsense dont care who you are anyone can do what they want as long as they put effort into it and as long as they dont harm someone else its fine with me,1,NOT
trish yes im trans but that doesnt mean im trans,1,NOT
im so glad that i found your channel through this video im freaking dying,1,NOT
someone needs to really explain what transgender actually means to trisha clearly,1,NOT
she is a fruitfly  a woman who lusts after gay men all the time,1,NOT

trisha is an og troll honestly im more concerned about her bs dietary stuff on instagram than this clownery,1,NOT
i am a straight female and have never understood the trans community but you seem so intelligent and normal i would be friends with you maybe trishas video will lead ppl to educate themselves and understand trans people better,1,NOT
i hate how youre actually still not recognizing nonbinary people as valid,1,NOT
shes a troll i dont think its about fitting in with anyone or being special or unique shes just trolling last month she fucked an alien blow up doll on camera so not much phases me when it comes to her im surprised people are actually covering the topic though,1,NOT
i liked this video within the first  seconds because the intro is everything,1,NOT
im watching this at costco eating cheap food and youre reactions are making me laugh out loud,1,NOT
im waiting for trisha to post a video captioned im a tomboy at  am,1,NOT
oh my gosh we have the same looking cat is your cat named angela or angelo if its a girl thats cool because i was told tabbys are usually boys like mine,1,NOT
she likes men and she likes sex so she likes seeing men have sex like its not science its just like how men like lesbians like dnhdkdhdjhf,1,NOT
if you know for a fact that you would most likely never have sex with them then why not be attracted to gayslesbians,1,NOT
there is a form of drag that women do theres a word for it but i cant remember i love drag ijust do,1,NOT
that part where you said that who you are attracted to has nothing to do with what you identify aslolblaire now you know the lgbt is gonna say something on that  i know what you mean though but someone else wont lol because someones going to say well because im attracted to women identify as lesbian or because i am attracted to men i identify as gay lol so yeah that part might get some backlash keep up your videos love you always help me cheer up cause you are super funny,1,NOT
i respectfully believe there is such a thing as non binary people,1,NOT
please make a video for us straight cis folks what all the terms mean,1,NOT

omg gurl youre so so pretty hehe,1,NOT
im bisexual girl and ive been attracted to straight girls so does that make me a straight man,1,NOT
 what the fuq is that,1,NOT
she can only decided if shes trans however   drag queen is not a gender  being attracted to gay men  gay men are attracted to men of all types masc fem think bear otter  shes stereotyping traditional gender roles  if shes  ok with her gender and body  shes not trans to my understanding isnt being trans  meaning being uncomfortable in your own body because it doesnt match how you view and feel about yourself ,1,NOT
while i do think shes joking i think its harmful because she has such a big following and bc shes the first or second video to pop up when you type transgender if shes going to mock a struggle and make some impressionable cis people think theyre trans she should take into consideration how many people will see it and will believe it i dont think she even realizes how many people will see that video and itll be the deciding factor for them to transition and then detransition because they done goofed,1,NOT
are you blaire open for recieving fanart and including it in merch,1,NOT
i dont know how to answer that blaire im confused shes a biological white woman who identifies as a man whom wishes she was a black woman so she could sleep with gay guys,1,NOT
blaire youre so pretty xx,1,NOT
and this is what that movement createsinsanity,3,NOT
trisha gets canceled by trisha ,1,NOT
wait i dont wear make up everyday and i dont do my hair am i a man now ,1,NOT
trisha is absolutely ridiculous i have  brothers mostly guy friends and have always been known as one of the guys but that doesnt make me a trans guy i like video games and dont wear make up but i never had a doubt that i am a cisgender female trisha has contradicted herself every step of the way and just cant stand not being the center of attention she plays the victim all the damn time freaking smh ,2,NOT
trisha is clearly just a super lost person shes grabbing onto anything and everything to feel acceptance shes the definition of hotmess whos way too involved in internet fame its all she has and this is just sad its also super wrong though you cant just jump on something thats so serious as another thing to get you validation when so many are going through a real struggle that people need to support,3,NOT
people saying a thousand percent as if they think it is more than a hundred percent stupid,1,NOT
even if shes trolling that honestly makes it worse she has no issue making the lgbt community look like a bunch of confused attention seeker psychos just so she can get some attention she claims to care about lgbt rights but has no issue pulling this stunt that gives them more bad rep,2,NOT
why would she think that trans is on the outside clothes shoes makeup,1,NOT
finally a source where my radical feminists mom will listen to,1,NOT
my mother used to tell me that she made less than my father the work in the same company but in different categories and it was because of that funny enough she makes more now than my father so i guess that makes sense hahaha,1,NOT
so the only difference is some women choose or get in general jobs that pay a little less hm i knew feminists were stupid,1,NOT
that small  cent gap is actually due to men more likely to try and get promoted and payed more while women are content in their position and dont seek to get promoted,1,NOT
thank god someone made a good video about this topic now when some sjw brings up the argument of the gender wage gap i can bring this video up,1,NOT
this is so stupid that this has to be explained to people feminists just like to make shit up to make themselves feel better,3,NOT
who is this woman and why is she so smart,1,NOT
the  cents for every dollar story is obviously not the point discrimination happens before wage realizes and works exactly by influencing the choices this video talks about this is something you can hardly change through legislation we need a culture of equality,1,NOT
does a women really have to say it before everyone sees that the wage gap is a myth,1,NOT
you mean sex gap,1,NOT
k dislikes k ignorant snowflakes,1,NOT
you just take a woman who works a job and a male who works the same job same hours same number of days same number of raises and compare their pay,1,NOT
but shit it was  cents ,1,NOT
the sex based pay gap is a lie the inference by feminists is that a man and a woman working side by side doing the same job dont get paid equally that is a lie the pay gap is an average of all male and female workers across all careers the reason men as a whole make more than women as a whole is simple you dont see as many women choosing to work dangerous demanding hazardous jobs how many maternity ward nurses are dying from black lung like coal miners do how many social workers are  week long shifts non stop like oil rig workers or working construction on buildings with only a harness for    weeks without break men also tend to work more hours every week so obviously theyd be paid more equal pay isnt possible unless theres equal effort so ladies if you want the pay gap to decrease stop going to school to be a florist and join a fire academy otherwise shut the hell up and stop saying things like being a mother is the hardest job in the world if you can do your job in your pajamas then no its not the hardest job in the world,2,NOT
because not hieing a man or a woman for that reason is illigal,1,NOT
i didnt need a video i already knew this was happening but hey people need to know this,1,NOT
the fact that a petroleum engineer earns the most money while social worker earns the least reflects something deeply wrong about the values of our culture social workers phycologists counselors etc help people navigate lifes complexities one on one where it is most needed petroleum engineers make gas companies wealthier and sustain co driven climate change thingspeople perhaps the problem is with our cultures values not our cultures sexism,1,NOT
k feminists missed the like button with their sausage fingers,1,NOT
im making a presentation on this in school and i cant wait to piss off my liberal teachers,1,NOT
how about paying more for caringtype jobs but no thats socialism understanding people and appreciating a broader skillset that doesnt directly produce goods,1,NOT
this isnt a video about gender wage gap its about equal pay equal pay is just a small part of the gender wage gap why do women choose jobs and hours which pay less maybe its because they want kids or maybe they werent pushed towards it as kids themselves i feel like she needs to clarify the difference,1,NOT
just watch the first  seconds thats about it,1,NOT
 do you have proof to back that up except that great video,1,NOT
well thats good news,1,NOT
take that feminazis,5,ABU
links to studies,1,NOT
basically men care about money,1,NOT
any time someone brings up the wage gap i just get reminded of how ignorant our society is ,1,NOT
now this is some truth right here,1,NOT
this video while has some correct information is presented and framed in a way to show the side of the argument that affirms that the wage gap is not real there are similar videos put out by other organizations that have the same format they present facts in a way that supports there argument and leaving out those that dont while that wage gap is not as big as some groups claim it is larger than this video claims the topic is very complex and there is no definitive answer because the every situation is different so to say its a us versus them argument is just letting a very complex situation fall pray to party politics,1,NOT
i was checking my subscription box when this video played and i was just about to hit the skip button until i heard theres no such thing as wage gap decided to watch till the end and immediately shared in all my social media losing some friends probably,1,NOT
in other countries however this actually happens,1,NOT
great video keep it up,1,NOT
mrs sommers you should be louder because we need someone loud about this nice to see my dear pennsylvania has professors who can see actual facts i plan to move to the us next year to study there im  years ahead i got everything ready except for the immigration papers we decided to pay full tuition despite the fact that i could have tried for scolarship because we thought it would make immigration easier it didnt we still got until mid  to figure this out so not very worrisome at the moment but still i wish we could get all that paperwork behind as soon as possible,1,NOT
while i seem to agree that this video is right about its point it didnt really disprove the wage gap instead it puts the gap into perspective also you assumed that the people pushing the wage gap are liars ignorance and a whole slew of other factors can make a person stick with the wrong opinion,1,NOT
this prageru people are the same people who told smoking cigarettes are good for health,1,NOT
dang it this vid was klickbait and did not feature any new informations to me so over here in germany the gender wage debate mainly focuses on jobs suited for men that do not allow women to be women in the following way my scienceteacher originally never meant to become a teacher she had an extremely well paid job in a laboratory now guess what she eventually fell in love and wanted children well children or career,1,NOT
theres a gap but it isnt because women are paid less due to their gender its because they are expected to sacrifice their career for their children because of their gender if more women had the support to work full time and men felt comfortable being the more full on parent i dont mean that dads are lazy or dont care we wouldnt have women complaining about the pay gap and men complaining that the system is against them when it comes to children,1,NOT
did she just assume their gender,1,NOT
wowwwwwwww real revolutionary take their prager,1,NOT
so    or  is so small that it almost vanishes it may seem like a small number but thousands per year over a lifetime is not insignificant,1,NOT
so my uncle was incorrect well hes a bit more central while my parents are center or mid right im far right,1,NOT
i wish i could share this on facebook but i would be called a racist and a bigot by all my liberal friendsand im a female,1,NOT
just like gun control and the race war these ideassubjectsdebates are kept alive to generate revenuetraffic the majority is that they will never disarm america we have woman in power positions making substantial income we have had a president of color these topics generate alot of traffic,1,NOT
wow i love this channel i just found it today,1,NOT
feminist double thinking propaganda,1,NOT
thank you great video,1,NOT
just goes to show you that if feminists had their way women would be getting paid more money for less work than men,1,NOT
i would like a link to the cite where you found your studies,1,NOT
i am a feminist and agree with this video we are not all insane,1,NOT
liberals are lying brainwashed idiots,5,ABU
ah an advertisement i didnt mind viewing in its entirety,1,NOT
 people who cant handle the truth,1,NOT
yes but are the industries themselves sexist maybe some maledominated fields that sometimes pay more are discouraging for women with sexual harassment and such,1,NOT
thank you mam for clarification because nobody would be believe if man explain it,1,NOT
isnt it a huge problem that the  out of the  worst paying college majors are all based around directly helping vulnerable or disenfranchised people counselling and psychology early childhood education human services and community organisation social work sure i guess you can say women should pick better paying routes of education  even though people are naturally drawn to certain fields from their own interests and experiences but to me its more important that the people choosing these really noble fields who are disproportionately women should be getting payed more this is valuable work and it should be treated as such,1,NOT
thank you now i can show this to all my dumb friends,3,NOT
fabziy promoting left wing politics if you integrate that fine if you dont leave now leave our island the right is rising every day integrate or be enihilated you have  years death to islam death to europe union the british shall rise again,7,ABU
this s so true,1,NOT
the issue is not that women are paid less its that we value traditionally masculine jobs more than feminine ones teachers nurses and caretakers are seen as less valuable than engineers scientists and other masculine careers ultimately both women and men should have the freedom to choose a career without having to think of preserving their masculinity or femininty we need both men and women in teaching we need both men and women in engineering we need both men and women in the military we just have to work together,1,NOT
this is not to say that there arent sexist bosses of course but that they dont represent reasons for the tiny wagegap that does exist,1,NOT
your an idiot,5,ABU
how come this waitress makes less than her lawyer boyfriend explain that why she makes k a year but her boyfriend makes k a year,1,NOT
i make k a year self employed my wife makes k self employed am i contributing to the wage gap,1,NOT
gender wage gap my ass it has been illegal since  do the research people theres zero gender wage gap its just that its not their uppermost priorities to do whatever it takes to become whatever they want to be,1,NOT
notice how she didnt bring up women having children or wanting a home life once not once solid points,1,NOT
so i identify myself as what these people in the comments seem to hate and villainize a feminist it is true that the myth has been debunked but you still have to acknowledge that women recieve much more obstacles to the path of a successful career then there are safety issues attached with the working late hours also childbirth is a major reason for women to compromise on their careers regardless the wage gap is a myth and its a little known idea we need to spread the word,1,NOT
disapprove of most of the propaganda on this channel but this is a superb video with excellent supporting data thumbs up,1,NOT
why are the computers broccoli,1,NOT
women shouldnt even be allowed to work we wouldnt have this stupid myth if we just kept women at home in the first place,5,ABU
i understand why men hate the feminist movement men are not personally responsible for the devaluation of womens work to tackle this problem from the perspective of feminism is a mistake because it points the finger at men rather the finger should be pointed to capitalism businesses pay women less now and historically because they can and could so yes i believe in equal work for equal pay yet the lower paying jobs seem to be womens work is it then actually a choice or enslavement,1,NOT
im pretty sure you guys have already made a video on the wage gap why another one,1,NOT
the on going debate continues on whether there is a pay gap between men and woman and there are many arguments on both sides with opposing views on this issue the way gap brings up the issue that women are payed less than men in the working field most statistics for this topic come from the census bureau which looks at full time workers according to gould schieder and geier they go into detail explaining the different ways in which other people analyze the wage gap from looking at specific occupations or by taking into consideration part time jobs and how this may lead people to think that data on the wage gap is unreliable however no matter how people approach how they measure the wage gap there is always a gap i feel that those that do not believe in the wage gap look at the specific occupations or varying forms of measuring the wage gap such as christina hoff sommars in the myth of the gender wage gap in every example she explained there was still a gap between men and women whether big or small a gap is still evident her argument claiming that it is the pursuit of happiness that steers women and men to different career paths is not completely true there is a restriction women have due to their roles in motherhood and according to equal means equal even in female dominated professions men still get paid more looking beyond professional careers and taking into consideration professional sports teams men get paid much more than women when it comes to sports consider soccer although the womens soccer team far excels in the sport over the mens team they still get paid much less than them,1,NOT
the message is good and the information is correct but the only reason i wont share it is that the statistics and numbers are displayed in such a biasedmisleading way the numbers are convincing enough no need to mislead using this display of the numbers,1,NOT
feminist will just use this to make the wage gap myth,1,NOT
technically businesses dont exclusively staff women because its discriminatory which is illegal otherwise yeah this whole situation is pretty bunk so are the many quite like it information is all well and good but how are you gonna use it what are you going to do about this,1,NOT
i dont agree with a lot of what summers says in regards to abortion but she is spot on here i wonder how many times she has had to explain this,1,NOT
i wonder whats the gender pay gap between all of the infinite genders,1,NOT
the gap us real but sjws exaggerate it,1,NOT
she tells truth,1,NOT
what about the gender mandatory military service gap all around the worldevery time i bring up this gapwomen inmediately go to the obviously biological differences  reasoning of course men and women are different so they are ready to accept biological differences to explain the male only mandatory military service in places like my home country of cuba they accept that men are stronger that women have the burden of childbearing and all the limitations that come with it so of course they will be exempt from military service but then suddenly when it comes to explain differences in pay none of the previously mentioned reasons matter and it must be discrimination because patriarchy,1,NOT
we love u christina,1,NOT
ok but why do we perceive female dominated professions as requiring less skills and money etc for example computer programming and coding was considered a low level menial job when it was female dominated yet now coders make oodles of money and the job has a lot of respect we respect physicians yet in russia where medicine is a predominantly female workforce they have no respect for the profession there librarians were once respected and well paid and even now when they have more skills and education than ever before they are laughed at and paid like shit ever since females started dominating the profession teaching was also the same i dont think women are paid less for simply being women i think we value male work over female work if you compare education levels for different jobs you will find that in female dominated industries they will be lower paying than similar levels of education than in male dominated industries since women have taken over the field of biology the median wage has gone down  wages for designers fell by  when females started to gain ground in the industry of the  top highest paying professions  are male dominated,1,NOT
feminists but this is wrongbecause of reasons,1,NOT
median  meanaverage get your terminology right otherwise the left will eat you alive,1,NOT
ill explain the wage gap how many women cant get a date because theyre unemployed how many men can get a date for making minimum wage feminists create the problem making men have high motivations then complain about the problem blaming men for it wanting your cake and eat it too is a privileged mindset,1,NOT
all dislikes are from feminists,1,NOT
see i have trouble with this video it does present facts but is very biased how does pay and bonuses compare between men and women in executive roles how does pay compare between men and women managers and supervisors how does pay compare between men and women in technical fields engineering programming etc really i could probably make a video espousing the benefits of tobacco smoking how it helps focus the mind increases productivity reduces stress in stressful situations is a mild appetite suppressant so can help with weight loss without leading to an eating disorder doesnt cause mental instability like hard drugs do afterwards you might be totally convinced that smoking is amazing at the same time the video would be misleading because it doesnt present the risks of smoking so yeah men and women working in low level jobs are going to be paid the same or are they men tend to gravitate to higher earning jobs and women tend to gravitate to caring jobs but i need to see like for like comparisons in a sample of specific fields before i would be convinced making a video like this is just fluff for sexists and misleading for others,3,NOT
right because adele lim getting paid k while peter chiarelli gets paid k despite both being cowriters on crazy rich asians has nothing to do with gender  got it,1,NOT
big thumbs up for this lady,1,NOT
pay gap is it real or not theres so many controversial opinions about this but my opinion is somewhere in between information providing from some of the readings and viewings made me understand and gather some opinions of my own about gender pay gapgendered labor i actually believe that men are more favored in high paying jobs than women are in adams et al he provided some ideas and real life situations that might cause women to get paid less hold a lower position or not getting hired at all one of them things he mentioned was that some businesses prefer males because in this gendered stereotypical society women are more likely to leave work or miss work for family stuff unlike men where they will choose work first to be able to provide for their family because of this idea that men focus on work more than women it allows men to get promoted easier or get hired first in his book he also provided a list of equal situations for both men and women and how each of them are perceived differently i dont necessarily think theres an accurate pay gap where a man and women with the same job title get paid differently but i do think men are likely to get promoted higher than a women in order to pay them more in the video there is no gender wage gap she talked about how the wage gap isnt accurate because it counts for all women and all men working but it doesnt distinguishes between careers or whether they are part time or full time in her video i agree that more of the higher paying jobs is dominated by men and the lowest is dominated by women so of course you see the difference of the pay women and men get like she said its a choice but its also societys fault for making some careers seem gendered for example engineers for men and teaching for women personally im a liberal studies major and im choosing a low paying job im not sure why or even if i want to do it anymore because of this topic but it was my choice to go for a less paying career,1,NOT

women earn less because they work less with less workload and in less dangerous or less valueadded functions not to mention that they do not have the biological capacity of a man for specific generally higherpaying jobs including most of them with high exposure and vulnerability and by themselves require more mental and physical as well as emotional capacity to be realized woman is woman man is a man they are not equal   although they complement each other before the emergence of feminism they are intimately different  women in the current matriarchal feminist parasite society demand are privileged and without any trouble reach your requirement and this is because of the man who did not understand anything of what happens around you overestimates enables empowers and rewards that the woman has not value is not enabled should not be authorized or awarded the mistake is of the male especially the traditional one who contests with the feminist males to see who privileges the woman more to receive at least crumbs of attention  as the male is needy   he lets the woman destroy the society just because he wants to be a gentleman  kkkkk ptbr mulheres ganham menos porque trabalham menos com menor carga de trabalho e em funes de menor perigoou de menor valor agregado  sem falar que no possuem biologicamente a capacidade que um homem tem para funes especficas  geralmente mais bem remuneradas  inclusive a maioria delas com alta exposio e vulnerabilidade  e por si s requerem mais capacidade mental e fsica assim como emocional  para serem realizadas mulher  mulher  homem  homem  no so iguais apesar de se complementarem antes do surgimento do feminismo  so intimamente diferentes  mulheres na atual sociedade matriarcal parasita feminista exigem serem privilegiadas e sem dificuldade nenhuma alcanam sua exigncia  e isto  por causa do homem que no entendendo nada do que acontece a sua volta supervaloriza habilita autoriza e premia o que a mulher no tem valor no  habilitada  no deveria ser autorizada e nem premiada a culpa  do machoprincipalmente o tradicionalque disputa com os machos feministas para ver quem privilegia mais a mulher para receber pelo menos migalhas de atenocomo o macho  carente ele deixa a mulher destruir a sociedade s porque quer ser cavalheirokkkkk,3,NOT

wage gap is real,1,NOT
anyone man or woman that is a business or financial major knows that there is no such thing as a wage gap,1,NOT
the gender wage gap is obviously a myth i mean how the hell would companies get away with paying men more for the same work which by the fact is illegal to do and why do i never see any of my most assertive female colleagues at my job complain about it i know a girl at my workplace who is very friendly and all of that but she would never accept to be discriminated like that and would make a very big deal out of it all the time if it actually happened but she seems to love being there and has a great time and she has worked there for at least  years,1,NOT
soooo the decisions people make to take a job arent conditioned by the education society give them,1,NOT
love this channel,1,NOT
ma wage gap button,1,NOT
the issue with this is that they do not touch on why men get these jobs so much more than women its not like there arent women in these fields also they didnt touch on the biological aspect of the university majors all the maths and sciences get more money but men tend to have more of an affinity for maths and science while females tend to be better at the arts,1,NOT
the answer is  work hard as men,1,NOT
the reason why they said there is a pay gap is because they combined the jobs so maybe more men have better jobs however that can lead to a controversial topic about employment discrimination,1,NOT

this new wave of feminism were in currently must go towards tackling breaking down gender stereoptypicsl mentalities and try create equality in the ways that men and women are brought up to think thats the new frontier we should stop focusing on the agendas of second or thirdwave feminism and move towards things like creating a society where boys arnt shamed for displayin vulnerability and emotion where girls are taught that they can reach high positions within their work where both men and women take equal responsibilty over paternal and domestic duties break down gender roles is what im saying its all about how we think now the wage gap is thing of the past and a myth in todays work place im saying this as a feminist ranting and raving about it is only detracting from other work place injustices that women and men encounter feminism isnt dead theres still so far to go but the wage gap just isnt relevant today in the western world love your average local feminist x,1,NOT
wage gap for attack helicopters go,1,NOT
dont business like investment for example  hire men more often because the people paying for this feel more comfortable with a man instead of a women explaining this stuff its sexism but its what happens stem jobs dont really matter though since as long as the job is done its done,2,NOT

damn the script comes in clutch now i can just copy and paste my comebacks lol,1,NOT
they did actually lie about how the wage gap is calculated and the aauw that they referenced does not say the wage gap is from occupation they lied about what another organization says and no one bothered to fact check,1,NOT
ive always found this complicated attempt at explaining the wage gap through choices and other factors to be pointless the problem is so much simpler comparing medians just isnt a useful metric its so wellknown that it has a name simpsons paradox for all we know women actually get paid more than men for equal work and the effect reverses when taking a median due to this statistical phenomenon tldr medians tell us nothing in this situation period no need to explain why the discrepancy appears with choices hours worked college majors etc,1,NOT
the wage gap actually does take other factors into consideration its an average based on men and women with the same occupation,1,NOT
best video about wage gap on yt,1,NOT
i need to show this to my sis since she a feminist and if i say a rape joke or something to do with a female she god damn response in a ass way,3,NOT
stop sending me adds i hate your channel i vehemently disagree with your views you have a right to them but stop spamming every ad i see on yt,1,NOT
i agree with the general conclusion of the videowage gap is not mainly due to sex but more about choices however there is still partial effect  lets say  due to the fact that some managers  could be women dont prefer to promote women to execute positions due to prejudice and stereotyping from personal experience wage gap is more apparent due to racial and religious differences rather than sex,1,NOT
nobody believes in this gender wage crap its just an obvious extortion racket,1,NOT
i would love to share this video but would probably get shit for it,1,NOT
wait is the calculation based on median or average both terms used in a short space to describe same calculation method quite an error to make,1,NOT
the gender wage gap is described as the relationship between men and womens pay it is said that women are getting paid roughly  cents to the dollar that every man makes the wage gap is calculated by taking the average amount full time men and women make and dividing them by each other to get the difference in regards to womens soccer from the article pay disparity in us soccer there seems to be a pretty large pay difference between the players however there is also a benefit difference for instance women get a salary and possible bonuses along with health benefits and maternity leave whereas men do not reap these benefits but i would assume the article did not include mens salary they make more if they play often i chose to watch the video there is no gender wage gap and i do agree with some of the points that she brings up for instance she spoke about choices that men versus women might make that add to the variables of the pay they earn womens often choose jobs that are not considered to be the most high payingpersonally i do agree with some aspects that she brings in the video i chose to go to school to become an elementary school teacher i could have chosen a route with a much higher pay but i enjoy working with children and love the classroom environment being a school teacher i would be able to have summers and holidays off i believe it would be a profession where i could also raise a family without having to pay thousands of dollars for childcare,1,NOT
ladies and gents unless someone pointed this out already search there is no gender wage gap on youtube and even put it in quotation marks if you want you will not find this video anywhere close on your search results maybe youll find it if you go  results down i dunno,1,NOT

this explains the issue of gender roles and how it leads to career choices very pleased with how women have been gravitating toward jobs labeled as male jobs,1,NOT
what they really mean is women should be paid the same as a man for the same job title not the same work i have noticed in my life i have had the same job title as women but i was required to lift more any produce more then then women in my job just cause you think you are working harder then someone else doesnt mean you are if someone takes  min to do a job and i take  min todo the same job i will spend  min pissing around so does that mean the person that took twice as long to do the job working twice as hard nope this idea that woman work as hard as men or harder is bs sorry that woman have to put in more energy to do the same work as men but you are not working harder,2,NOT

here are some more stats  according to the glassceiling index featured in economist magazine women on company boards in us during  are less than  and women in managerial positions in us are at about  according to an article in us news data approx  of american women were getting their mba in  having children does play a part for women as well as working round the clock for men but this paradigm is not healthy for all involved including the corporations who have a group of overly tired and stretched out employees on their payroll,1,NOT
you cant talk about choices most people cant just choose their career they just have to accept the job for how it is and no most people cant decline a contract because they have kids rent and other bills to pay working more hours should not be a virtue in fair society there must be a  hour work week or less women are really disadvantaged because of pregnancy and after birth so they cant work as much as men do a fair government must help women with expanded parental leave we should not think that workers are better if they work more piecework should be already exceeded,1,NOT
lmao the amount of people being misinformed by this video is amazing why do you think men are available oncall to their job more than women because its not their job to go feed the kids help them do their homework and tuck them into bed those are called agentic traits women are expected to have communal traits there are so many theories that debunk this video its actually ironic an old lady who is like  years old is voicing this video its as antiquated as all the dinosaurs who comment supporting it,1,NOT
its funny that our economy seems to favour less the jobs that women tend to take in what ways is a loan shark more useful to society than a nurse why are footbal players more valued than kindergarden teachers why are engineers which are very important dont misunderstand me paid much more than home health aides those are vital and immeasurably important positions yet most of these people struggle with income while bankers laugh away their problems with other peoples money,1,NOT
bassed ma is my spirit animal,1,NOT
the best thing isits told by a women,1,NOT
i think that firstly there is a huge mix up between the unequal pay for the same job wich is illegal and the gender wage gap the actual ctsdollar wich is a real problem that being said yes it can be explained with the job differences of course there is an explication but the problem is that womens dont actually chose not to be an ingeneer or a computer scientist they are more or less unconsciously banned from those kind of jobs because historicaly these are men jobs and thats exactly what is unfair and what we have to fight against because a women isnt less legitimate to be an ingeneer and neither naturally more skilled to be a nurse btw imo this channel is dangerous because they always avoid the real debate instead they focuse on prooving smthing else which is easier and then claim to have solved the debate,1,NOT
whats that i hearangry feminists that wont admit they are wrong,2,NOT
can everyone be forced to watch this,1,NOT
many liberals understand the truth they are the ones selling the lie they know that adjusting or politically equalizing the money is a lot easier than equalizing the choices or the work it just moves the money away from those making the less attractive choices over to those who take the easier path want to know how long that works out go visit greece,1,NOT
if i had a penny for every time the wage gap was mentioned the wage gap would be real,1,NOT
next argument they will make well women were told all their lifes to do that wait they are already saying that,1,NOT
 of all work place deaths are men,1,NOT
saw an ad for this channel on this video lol,1,NOT
this is comparing apples with pears of course there is a gap between career choices and the imbalance of gender in these careers is based on early age internalized gender roles but also careers in science for example make it almost impossible for women to unite family and career ambitions that is why many women step out at an early stage of their career but its because of sexist circumstance not choice this video is not doing a service to this issue,1,NOT
why are the jobs that women prefer undervalued isnt there some amount of sexism at play in at least that aspect,1,NOT
there is a noticeable wage gap at the highest levels of income ceos ext but it is not nearly as pronounced as people think,1,NOT
for once i actually agree with a prageru video,1,NOT
wage gap mo like thigh gap tha bitch hella thic,3,NOT
any links to a counterargument,1,NOT
deep inside we all know this,1,NOT
men often get degrees based on job availability and pay men then seek jobs in the career field they studied in men are more likely to ask for higher pay men tend to stay at the same company for longer men stay in the same career field for longer men work more hours men take less time off men are more likely to relocate for a job men are more likely to convince their spouse to support their career all of these factors increase mens pay to represent the current wage gap that gap should not be closed by government mandate,1,NOT
i wonder if women gravitate towards the occupations that dont pay as well or if we as a society dont value the occupations that women gravitate towards if it is the former why would women do that,1,NOT
theres is a gap simply because you are comparing two there is no such thing as exactly the same not sexism on a world wide scale there may be but not in modern westernized civilizations if there is sexism it would probably be a very small percentage,1,NOT
thank you for speaking the real truth,1,NOT
this was a very well explained video,1,NOT
ive actualy seen videos of people asking workers about their income and the people they ask is a financial advisor male and a secretary female,1,NOT
why is everyone in this comments section so threatened by the myth of the wage gap even the video admits that there is around a  unexplainable wave gap its just a fact that women on average earn less,1,NOT
 of nurses are women  their average salary is about   of doctors are men  their average salary is  btw i am telling a fact,1,NOT
what about actors and other enormously paying jobs isnt that the one feminists actually moan about not nurses and teachers,1,NOT
i think it has something to do with the fact that women arent pressured as much as men to work men are waaaayyy more pressured to have money in their pockets so it makes sense they would go for the jobs that pay more sex is also a motivator for men to have money theres still a whole slew of women in the world who aspire to be housewives it doesnt mean women are less ambitious  some nurses works  hour shifts we just have different levels of whats comfortable,1,NOT
i loved the talk with jordan peterson saying that women are much more sensible than men for not pursuing more career advancement once youre not living in destitution the extra money you have does little or nothing to improve your happiness,1,NOT
 feminists watched this video,1,NOT
thank you cristina,1,NOT
so yes there is a wage gap and everybody in disagreement with you only read the title and got right own into the comment section and made some edgy joke about feminism and moved on,1,NOT
thats bollocks gender wage gap is a reality ,1,NOT
my teacher said that men are a lot worse in school and then they get paid more than females when i tried to explain she got mad,1,NOT

i love this conservative channel if the jewish american business society had a youtube channel this would be it point one of sexism  getting a woman to speak about the wage gap because she is a women good job i think you fundamentally failed at your there is no wage gap if conservative statistics put it at  cents that is still a wage gap and much less than the actual figures,1,NOT
could anyone attach here the study by the aauw a friend of mine is creating some twitter posts against rd wave feminists and i need the study but the one ive found is far from that  wave gap the video shows thank you so much and have a great day,1,NOT
no printer just faxx d,1,NOT
the best part about this is a female is narrating this this channel is my hero,1,NOT
say it a little louder the ignorant feminists didnt hear you,2,NOT
why cant you put your sources of information in the description so i can actually take you seriously,1,NOT
so its incredible retarded that this philosopher who works in a shitty university comments on a topic that she clearly knows little about as an economist let me comment on a few things  yes businessman are making a monetary loss whenever they do not hire a women with lower wages since they could potentially lower their labor costs however as gary becker pointed out long ago a rightwing economist who is a nobel prize winner if employers have both some monopoly power and distate women they can get away with discriminating women given that the forces of competetion wont work properly  the same basic result applies whenever the reality deviates from perfect competition for example whenever there are search frictions in the labor market or in other words when you have to actually spend time searching for a job which is the case in real economies  different career paths may not be choices or voluntary whenever there are gender restrictions on in certain occupations as there are in many places in the develiping world whenever an occupation is overly seggregated or whenever discrimination caused an unequal distribution of math test scores for example women cannot really choose to be an engineer if they face a gender gap in math to begin with  of course women work less hours and thus are promoted less ever heard of the glass ceiling as men why because domestic work is unequally distributed and women bear the whole burden of domestic work in most countries of the world if we had some policies to socialize care work as there are already in place in many developed countries then the gap in market hours between men and women would diminish substantially all of this is not either common sense nor a leftist conspirancy its just good science,3,NOT
so you admit that businesses would save  by hiring only women to do the same work then go on to say that the wage gap doesnt exist anyone who made it past that and still believed this nonsensical video should really questions their life choices,2,NOT
i love the truth great job again christina,1,NOT
she is my hero,1,NOT
i wish i could go to prager,1,NOT
men can work longer hours because they arent at home taking care of their children in  of homes women do the majority of household chores and taking care of their children when sick not to mention a vast majority of single parents are women the earnings gap is very small when men and women are both out of college and working the same position however women earn less over time when they have children and then have to take care of them,1,NOT
yes but why do female strippers  prostitutes make more money than the male ones,1,NOT
 completely off topic but im gunna be studying aerospace engineering at ut already got accepted next couple years and i knew i was in for a sausage fest but god damn man,1,NOT
isnt that remaining gap still choice the amount of hours worked,1,NOT
there isnt a wage gap just look at what its referenced for the math earnings not hourly wages if you must claim there is a gap at least recognize that it isnt in the wage paid but in what people earn,1,NOT
based mom back at it again,1,NOT
i find it interesting that the college majors that women seem to gravitate toward in larger numbers are those that are highly useful in motherhood  nurturing children  aiding in family stability ,1,NOT
sounds like we need to pay certain occupations more like teachers,1,NOT
if theres a wage gap wouldnt everyone hire women,1,NOT
the wage gap between male and female is complete nonsense im taking human resources management in college right now and the professor just recently told us that females make only c to the  that men make what crap but then again i am a conservative in southern california,1,NOT
great video its about time someone shut down this obviously false myth,1,NOT
my favourite at work is looking at over time  of women in my job decline the overtime whereas  of men accept it,1,NOT
spicy stuff right here,1,NOT
round of applause for a university that doesnt push an agenda and uses statistics factually,1,NOT
feminists just need to take a simple econometrics course,1,NOT
the wage gap goes a bit deeper than personal choices society has stemmed from patriarchal norms and in turn women are expected to work these jobs although this may seem like a choice from the women their choice is influenced by history and present day society yes these norms will be hard to change and nobody should expect them to change in any short period of time but opening up more choices for women and trying to learn from history so it is not repeated is a good way to get the ball rolling,1,NOT
 dislikes but still no comments of feminists defending their point why because they dont have one,1,NOT
this is brilliant ,1,NOT
my main issue with this is the fact that feminist is used with a condescending tone there is nothing wrong with being an activist for equal rights feminist doesnt necessarily mean the outspoken people that everyone refers to as snowflakes,1,NOT
oh no look at the thumbnail the woman is holding the money bags lower than the man,1,NOT
fantastic video saved me hours of explanation to my leftist friends,1,NOT
so its ok if theres a gender wage gapif the industry is dominated by one gender unless youre a nurse,1,NOT
there most definitely is a wage gap between men and women about two thirds of the gap is due to uneven distribution among various occupations and differences in skills and experience while the last third cannot be explained and has been attributed to discrimination in the work force the discrimination can be explained by the glass ceiling which is the seemingly invisible barrier hindering advancement of women and minorities in a maledominated organization clayton  works cited clayton gary e economics principles  practices new york ny glencoemcgrawhill ,1,NOT
and by just using your supposed common sense that you claim in this video to justify the gap then you are just judging a saw man and a needle woman in their ability to cut wood,1,NOT
carfull shes a hero,1,NOT
so if we want the wage gap to go away we need to encourage our daughters to go into higher paying fields i can do that ,1,NOT
why do you think that women gravitate toward industries such as social services and education perhaps it is because those jobs facilitate child caring duties it is undeniable that the majority female children are raised to see their mothers taking the lead in this regard to the point that even on an unconscious level careers can be influenced by the structural demands on women the disparity between women and men is not just on an income level,1,NOT
oh god this is gold,1,NOT
anyone who believes in the wage gap  dollar to  cents it wouldnt surprise me that they believe in flat earth,1,NOT

my sister is a fullon stereotypical millennial feminist and i absolutely destroyed her with these facts thank you,1,NOT
the wage gap is so old and obviously debunked im an extreme leftist and i know this,1,NOT
exactly if i could hire someelse to do the job for less i would right now wages are my biggest expense,1,NOT
 i feminist cant take facts,3,NOT
what about the work hours gap,1,NOT
thanks i needed to find the truth for my speech,1,NOT
k triggered feminists disliked,2,NOT
did anyone want to ask why the the male and female dominated careers make less money because social work elementary education are far more important to society than any of the high paying career choices yet they make far less also in the early days of counseling psychology it was a very high paying job even though we do a better job now and for some reason now its one of the lowest paying careers i could go on and on because this video is promoting the more favorable conservative idea that everyone has complete control over their lives and the truth is no one does,1,NOT
imagine fire on the feminists ass right now ooooo bitches got debunked again,3,NOT
theres a reason why conservatives are on the right wing because we are right,1,NOT
companies that hire in fields dominated by men such as engineering will place priorities on hiring women and minorities in order to meet their diversity metrics women and minority students who wish to pursuit in a fields dominated by men will have an easier time getting scholarships because they are always trying to increase the diversity i think that men just want to be around more women lmao anyone who tries to say theres a wage gap are either lieing to you or lack experience in the real world,1,NOT
i like how its a woman saying the wage gap is a myth,1,NOT
it is likely there is some gender earnings gap due to discrimination in the  or so we cant yet explain but it is completely irresponsible to say we cant explain all of the pay gap therefore discrimination that is just bad logic this is a common tactic in politics to jump to conclusions in defense of personal agenda,1,NOT
this garbage is a bunch of propaganda,2,NOT
so why are traditionally femaledominated occupations lower paying than traditionally maledominated ones ie why do trades people engineers and lawyers making more than teachers social workers and nurses is it because men once ruled almost the entire workforce and put more value on their own strengths and less on femaleoriented ones such as caring for others this systematic inequality has been perpetuated over the years its not just about the choices females make its about what we value in our workforce that has been dictated to us decades ago by men,1,NOT
well now there is man are paid less than women,1,NOT
title there is no gender wage gap  the wage gap is  huh it is very true that many people use the  wage gap number without any nuance or detail and that number is misleading to the point of being wrong but arguing against the weakest version of your opponents argument is not very impressive the better informed concerns over the wage gap focus on career choices particularly at universities its true that better paying college degrees are pursued disproportionately by men and this video simply states it and moves on this is the heart of the question though so why do men pursue these degrees at higher rates then women are parents teachers others in society subconsciously steering girls away from the boring nerdy stuff is this a case of the soft bigotry of low expectations do inschool and afterschool programs that teach extracurricular like cad programming electronics etc lean towards recruiting boys instead of girls are the teachers of these programs disproportionately men resulting in more role models for boys than for girls does networking through alumni favor male grads because most of the alumni in wellpaying fields are alumni creating a kind of inertia that subconsciously favors male over female grads does society place far more pressure on women to marry younger and raise kids leading couples to split childrearing duties unevenly and slowing done womens careers concerns about the gender gap are commonly dismissed as nothing more than a pipeline problem there are certainly feminists who want to make more out of this than simply a pipeline problem but a pipeline problem is still a problem and in my opinion a substantial one at that realists who want to solve this problem are trying to make schools parents and society as a whole aware with the hope that girls feel like stem degrees are a choice for them but this video it breaks the  gap down just enough to get to the answer its looking for but not enough to acknowledge or delve into the heart of the question this video leads one to think that theres no problem here the reality is that a deeper understanding of the issue requires finding answers to the questions i outlined above deciding if those answers reveal problems that need to be fixed and taking action as needed,1,NOT
but theyll never listen to these facts this gender wage gap has been debunked so many times that it has become a joke whenever they use it,1,NOT
best thing is it is said by women boss choice,1,NOT
roses are red there was a president nicknamed teddy this is old news i knew this already,1,NOT
there are so many variations of that that no one can cover them all neither do you it can be  percent in one study and  in another the point is that no matter how you flip ittheres always a gap in favor of men that indicates a real problem and not just lies you can see that is backed up by every study done,1,NOT
a lot of twisted information in this video disgraceful,1,NOT
i respectfully disagree with this i offer the anecdote that my wife managed a store and was paid less than a male in the same position even when she exceeded the seniority he had for background we are both politically conservative,1,NOT
computer sciences is more like  male,1,NOT
 you literally say that there is a wage gap of  cents which is far too much  there are still localised problems which much be dealt with  many argue that it is the fact that women are encouraged into choices is the problem,1,NOT
its like what trump said youre gonna make as much if you do as good of a job,1,NOT
so this video is saying that the wage gap is a myth but then says it exists about  because of womens own poorer choices what a bad argument and how much it ignores societys discouraging attitudes towards women going after careers in the sciences or leadership positions it disregards that sexism exists in the workplace its not anywhere near common sense to say working long hours aka as many as your company wants you too determines your work value when specialized skills and benefits to having a secure and healthy are not even considered as part of a career,1,NOT
and why are these particular jobs paid less do we just blindly accept that computer science is somehow better than education,1,NOT
if this woman ever runs for president shes got my vote,1,NOT
thank you for being smart,1,NOT
it is true that businesses pay people who are on call and willing to work longer hours more money i remember working at this popular fast food place in america as a legal immigrant and i got a higher hourly wage than the other workers because i was willing to work later than the americans and i did things the americans would not do as an immigrant i got a higher pay than other male workers and female workers and it was all because of the quality of work i put in before i left america the manager even promised an even higher hourly wage if i decided to come back people pay quality workers more money,1,NOT
but some career choices dont allow women to duo certain things and some sexism is actually in school so i go home and i tell my mom that at school that let the boys do fun things like move chairs table but only thing girls can do is file papers so and then she said well the try not to hurt the girls we so we can have children well its not obligated for a women to have children,1,NOT
holy moly this woman needs to be president,1,NOT

are you insane min preroll add how is this even something that slipped through,1,NOT
thank you  now i dunderstand,1,NOT
sure  cents on the dollar may not be true but  is still really really shitty lets say you had a job that payed  a year and at the end of the year your boss came in toting a new company policy where all female employees are given a  bonus for doing your exact same job would you think oh yeah its only  not a big deal or would you be pissed that you were being payed less and told it must just be different choices that were hurting your income,1,NOT
one sentence says it all if u could get away with  wages for women wouldnt u hire just women cant argue with that,1,NOT
there would be more reasons why the top five majors have more men than women is it the stereotype of men and women that contributes to this result we need to put away the stereotypes and encourage women and men to develop themselves in a diversified way when can we really stop saying choose a stable job and stay in the family you dont have to be ambitousblablablato women and somehow deters them from realizing more possiblities,1,NOT
actually recent figures show that females earn about  more then men for the same job done overall not including modeling because that would be unfair,1,NOT

there is a study in germany that says that woman earn  les with the same backround,1,NOT
great video very succinct and informational allow to criticize one thing though i find ms summers reading too noticeable to my taste when she speaks i look into her eyes and i dont feel like shes looking back at me but rather reading a wide sign above my head there needs to be a topdown scrolling reading platform under the camera or something even more suitable i dont know the correct name for that but feel free to tell me i believe that would make the video even more professionallooking,1,NOT
prageru amazing logic and evidence based content until they bring up jesus then they resort to fallacies and fairy tales,1,NOT

i like how what people miss about the gender wage gap by vox and is the gender pay gap real by the vlog brothers are in the related videos watch those instead they do a much better job explaining the problem,1,NOT
women must just stay home,5,ABU
if for the same work women only make  cents for every dollar a man makes why dont businesses hire only women  men are usually face discomfort viewing women in positions of power let alone giving them the said positions if you only hired women then theyll be your entire workforce and youll have to listen to what the say for example if they demand salary inclease you wouldnt have a choice but to give it to them but if you have fewer women or a lot of women under the influence of more powerful men women cant demand anything because they are easily and cheaply replaceable,6,ABU
i still wanna see a womans pay stub that reads  below the minimum wage feminists,1,NOT
there is a spending gap however,3,NOT
see teacher there is none,1,NOT
so what these feminists want is equality of outcome not equal opportunity they want to they want to work crap jobs and get paid same as a ceo,1,NOT
imagine downvoting facts,1,NOT
now the real question is do you believe her or not i really want to believe her but i dont know her background rethinking a topic like this is great as long as you think critically of the sources if you want to believe something fact check it good luck this shitty world of liers everywhere,2,NOT
for every dollar a man makes a woman makes  dollar,1,NOT
feminists would complain that the reason why women are only in  of the  fields that pays the best are because they are women,3,NOT
why did not she mention pregnancy and raising children are not those the major factors affecting employers decisions regarding their employees in context of gender,1,NOT
woman are just incompetent in mathscience which are higher order skill set obviously men should be paid more and there should be a gap given man are more competent,5,ABU
imagine if this were a man talking even though the points would be exactly the same the opposing side would totally smite down the ideas the videos make fighting identity politics at their own game nice,1,NOT
this is the only channel where i learn something new with every video,1,NOT
what about the death on the job gap  men,1,NOT
k triggered feminists xd,1,NOT
i am woke,1,NOT
i like this video but i do wonder about when she talks about the choices women make when it comes to job choices because in the highest paying jobs listed women are less likely to take them because of the discrimination and expectations they face so when i look at it they present an illusion of choice that it is  womens choice to not take those jobs for the most part this is a well presented video but im just thinking about that so maybe its not only a wage gap problem but also the gender disparity in fields of work,1,NOT
work harder from my job experiences through life most but not all females work alot less and take more breaks and complain about the their pay not being as goods as the boys my solution to it work harder,5,ABU
oh theres wage gap between me and richfamilyprincess alright,1,NOT
okay but like why do women make these choices,1,NOT
this isnt sexism its common sense perfect,2,NOT
so why do women chose less good paying jobs you have this question first,1,NOT
idk about the united states but in switzerland we do have the wage gap and no one is denying it,1,NOT
very well said christina,1,NOT
era ora finalmente una altra leggenda metropolitana che scompare,1,NOT
welp quit watching after she said if women are paid so much less why dont businesses hire only women buddy friend pal if youre still repeating that nonsense argument you clearly have nothing to contribute women are paid less because their work is valued less than mens therefore businesses dont hire only women because they value womens work less would you hire a bunch of workers you believed are much lower quality workers simply so that you can pay them lower wages if you still lack this basic understanding of what the wage gap is then do not talk to me about why its fake if youre going to argue against something know what it is first sigh,5,ABU
i am interested in this university does this school have a football program if so do you let people in for football scholarships,1,NOT

amazing today we found out the new stunning fact that people people want equality of outcome,1,NOT
can i get the links to external sources,1,NOT
you video is very informative and truthful however i think you are missing the point its not about attempting to understand what is really going on they are not interested in that its about having a complaint regardless of whether it is legit backing it with some carefully crafted statistics andor research and repeating the complaint over and over and over until they get what they want which is never enough so they repeat the above because it works enough times and so they feel empowered and self righteous it is a mental disorder really,3,NOT
you can blame jennifer lawrence who thinks she is as tenured and as big of a draw as bradley cooper christian bale robert deniro and chris pratt,3,NOT

for some added fun see how thomas sowell dealt with this issue waaaay back in  on firing line it goes back a loooong way,1,NOT
there is a girl in my school who claims to be feminist she always brings up the wage gap and how it is wrong when we were having a debate in class i brought up all the points i learned in this video and she didnt care she is too hypnotized into believing what she wants to believe that she cant even think about the idea of there not being a wage gap after instantly shutting me down before i could finish talking she went on to say that everyone deserves equal pay and free speech,2,NOT
thank you this is a well made well researched video no yelling screaming or basing anything on emotion only the facts this should end the argument to anyone with half a brain ,1,NOT
how can there be a gender wage gap if there is  genders,1,NOT
the community organizer field is  female which helps to explain obama,2,NOT
she just made the point of the century in literally the first  seconds i love it ,1,NOT
in the video there is no gender wage gap it starts off by stating a statistic that a lot of sources use that women are paid  cents per every male dollar from the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real it states that women are paid  cents to every male dollar which is not far off from  cents the video i watched had a female presenting all the stats and opinions which is very clever by prager u who posted the video why not show a female talking about how there is no gender wage gap it just adds onto their argument the video states that if a person factors in different choices each gender makes on top of occupation position education and hours per week then then the wage gap nearly diminishes down to  cents i feel as if a person cannot just factor in choices because not everyone is in the same situation many women want families so when women are pregnant they go on maternal leave as long as they need or are allowed also women have been proven to do more work around the house and also take time off to be there for their kids women cannot be discriminated against just because of their choices it does not matter their choices also the video does not take into account the fact of race as we learned in class black and hispanic women are paid a lot less than women who are white or asian which is from the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real overall we can each have our own opinion if there is or is not a gap but the video there is no gender wage gap is filled with fallacies that are opinion based and not fact and research based like the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real,1,NOT
just as she mentioned at the very beginning if there was a wage gap fire all your male workers and hire  females you will reduce  on your worker costs or would you rather pay an extra  to help the male world domination,1,NOT
there absolutely is a wage gap it is illegal to pay men and women differently for the same work under the equal pay act of  yet women are not offered the same opportunities as men this video is misleading,1,NOT
damn patriachy making this poor woman report this so they could save cents to the dollar shame,1,NOT
male football players distort the average earnings of men and women,1,NOT
i cant seem to find the citations for this video could someone point me towards them,1,NOT
but business have started to hire only women just last year almost rd of new hires were women despite being less than half of the workforce population this trend has been worsening in recent years and shows no signs of reversing,1,NOT
rather than developing a interesting and fair debate on how we look at gender pay gap reports all this video does is reduce the issue to flawed simplistic arguements that suit a certain demographic of people while the arguement that the way gender pay is calculated may be too simplistic could be a valid this video abandons any hope of a nuanced debate by peddling the notion that most pay gap issues we see is due to the choice of women that will please all the antifeminists that believe women are trying to take their rights away not sure how youtubes algorithm landed this video inside my echo chamber probably missclicked on too many man on motorbike fights cop videos,2,NOT
you arent talking to actual feminists about the attempts to close the wage gap clearly high level efforts to closing the gap arent simply demanding women get paid more they are more frequently trying to solve the issues that cause the gap to occur those differences that you think need to be accounted for are the very things feminists are trying to address dont control for the issues that cause the gap fix those issues there is also an opportunity gap for many jobs not simply differences based on as you put it choices that its dishonest to ignore,1,NOT
clap clap clap,1,NOT
here is another variable over  of teachers are womenso when they calculate the wagesdo they factor in that full time teaching is actually only a part time job i doubt it,1,NOT
so what i understand is that men earn more money because they got better jobs my question is why is it not   males who get these jobs and  females,1,NOT
i love how  thousand people still disagree with the actual facts and statistics presented to them,1,NOT
feminism exists because of propaganda like this shite video nice try though i guess the tiny dick white guys need a boost up every now and again and of course all the republican woman who dont have any friends or souls need to feel appeased because their own mothers couldnt stand them and because they cant play well with others,3,NOT
who else is looking for butthurt feminists in the comments,2,NOT
i agree with this and if it is true then a law requiring men and women to be paid the same for the same qualifications and work should not be a problem,1,NOT
i cant find the wwau  cents anywhere cant come one direct me to it edit nvm found out that they took it down guess it didnt support their opinions,1,NOT
women are not available to work for long hours and with a flexible schedule because they are obligated to their family responsibilities and for which they dont get paid obviously while men are obligated only for a financial responsibility towards the family even in cases where either of them earn almost the same womens inability to work in places where there is potential danger and where physical strength is required is highly related to their body makeup and what nature has given them it is foolish to demand biologically more from a the other half of the human population instead work must be alloted according to the universal societal obligations of both the sexes and most importantly their biological limit on an average common sense isnt enough to justify a problem of this magnitude,1,NOT
i was scrolling through instagram the other day and i came across a comment that said the wage gap exists i told the person that the wage gap wasnt real and i actually used real facts to back up my arguments what triggered me the most was that the person had no common sense and didnt even wanna listen to meread my comments its so sad that ppl like this exist,1,NOT
this is retarded if ur gonna take the time to find legitimate facts and begin to make a legitimate argument please dont then just generally claim the wage gap doesnt exist both sides here are trying to brainwash it would be appreciated if u used ur useful research for a purpose other than this blatant sexism,2,NOT
thank you thank you for this video i always knew this was a load of crp but now i know why,1,NOT
this video is about to cause a shit storm the size of katrina great job,1,NOT
women do not just choose to have less paid jobs they dont have much choice based on their experience which doesnt always depends just on them,1,NOT
they say a womans work is never donethat is why they get paid less ,3,NOT
if i pasted this on my facebook i would receive nothing but hatred and death threats,1,NOT
dont try to reason with feminists theyre already a lost cause,3,NOT
this is a good video with a deceptive title,1,NOT
so they have proved that peoples well being are not important families and people who work for a greater good obviously arent worth anything,1,NOT
i like that she as a woman is telling us this  proving that not all women believe in the wage gap  this really helps to show its not just evil men blindly denying a wage gap,1,NOT
watch ben shapiro use this all the time,1,NOT
 so wait youre trying to say theres a wage gap but its okay since women just naturally choose to not work hard enough and there are no women that work overtime or try to get higher paying jobs either if that is the case then why,1,NOT
i bet those  people got triggerd,1,NOT
why more women can be like her,1,NOT
where are those  female in my computer science classes i dont see them,1,NOT
the modern day woman is so reasonable,1,NOT
i have such a huge crush on christina hoff sommers ,1,NOT
hmmm choices maybe its not really choices but gender roles embedded in our society that in turn control or substantially affect these choices why do women chose majors like teaching or counseling or nursing because those are the rolesmajors women are generally expected to be interested in by choosing these majors they are less likely to have to compete with males and more likely to get the job when it comes to jobs like attorney ceo so forth these are jobs predominantly maintained by males and women are more likely to have to compete with them why does this competition matter if the woman is just as good an applicant oh because women are thought to have to pick up the kids when their sick be home in time to pick the kids up from school and have kids which means paid maternity leave and the list goes on thereby lessening the hours she can work and making her less competitive that also answers the hours question,1,NOT
seems that one study which was omitted is should be obvious that one which cites the fact that the greatest single explanation for the gap is the fact that women give birth to children and are more involved in raising them if fact when this factor is factored out the wage gap favors women it is much easier for women to exit and reenter the labor force than men women have a much greater number of occupations which are easier for them to exit and reenter than men women simply have many more employment options generally than men the wage gap is mostly a function of the fact that most men are employed continuously whereas that is less likely for most women,1,NOT
feminist   in south korea a feminist lawyer appeared on tv to talk about wage gaps and claimed victims by women however most of her low farm consists of men this is loman if i do it adultery if others do it,1,NOT
maybe i am a feminist bc i knew women have it way more harder than men i simply scared of childbirth and pain of period we have to deal it every month and to see men are free from that burden im just jealous like women are more prone to sexual harassment abuse bc women are weaker im sad bc everywhere i only see that women are viewed as sex object when it comes to logical and analytical skills men tends to be more good i sometimes jealous of the boys bc they can understand math and science more quickly than me or sometimes the girls maybe im way too objectify to the genders but idk im just sad why we get all the hard things this is just my thoughts peace i really really want to be a boy lol,1,NOT
finally someone who uses there brain,1,NOT
its totally misleading to not take into consideration the impact of motherhood on women career jobs with long hours  no flexibility are not compatible once you have a kid and you are responsible for it super biased,1,NOT
only commercial i didnt skip,1,NOT
these arguments are just strawmen they dont reflect the deeper societal sexisms that exist in society which are immeasurable,1,NOT
love this amazing work,1,NOT
christina hoff sommers once again with the knowledge bombs,1,NOT
i like some of prager us videos but the hypocrisy in this one really bothered me to me it clearly demarcates the true bias that our shortsighted society has against women and true femininityand its not the kind of bias that feminists propound we still live in a mans world remember that song where womens skills and interests which tend to be verbal and nurturing rather than the stem fields and womens call to be homemakers and to care for children and family members just arent valued economically it really is unfair many women and yes many men too spend countless hours giving unpaid care to children the handicapped sick and elderly our society expects this more and more doctors are releasing patients who need  nursing and can even prosecute someone who does not care for a family member but then we hypocritically turn around and blame womens choices because theyre not as singleminded about a career as men do you realize how much our society depends on unpaid people many of them women to check on the elderly in nursing homes to take care of sick people to call insurance companies and wrangle with doctors offices to care for autistic kids and small children our society could not afford to pay people to do what lots of moms do every day but this work has to be done and you cant trust that a hireling will always really give your loved one individualized care which is critically important for babies and young children what this video also shows it that in order to make a mans wages a woman has to somehow truly transgender herself she has to somehow be able to change her brain which is different from a mans and be able to think and act like a man and have the singleminded careerdrive of a man or be penalized economically this really puts women in an emotionally painful position and when i was a manager i saw women crying about this either abandon their children in daycare all the time or simply not have children at all then where would our society be in  or  years i realize that part of the problem is due to the work of extreme feminism our society no longer supports the traditional view of the family with husband who has the masculine drive and time to specialize in a career as prime provider with a family wage the change in our economy so that women are now almost forced to work in order for a family to be middleclass is probably the worst thing to ever happen to women honestly although i certainly think that women should have the right and option to choose a career i myself have a masters degree im an extreme conservative and i understand economics one of the areas in which i disagree with conservatism however is when conservatives hide behind the glib statement that people always have a choice yes we all do have certain choices but we do not have a choice as to our sex as well as our race our intelligence level our physical handicaps and how we are programmed biologically oftentimes the dogma of choice is just used by the intelligent the wealthy the lucky the healthy and the otherwise successful to justify why they should be rewarded more  in our society than others who perhaps work just as hard but in jobs or unpaid positions that our society considers to be menial or unworthy of remuneration,1,NOT
ok ladies start start choosing better jobs,1,NOT
this video brought a tear of happiness to my eyes finally someone stating the truth and calling out those who dont and providing evidence so nobody can debunk it prager you just become my favorite company ever cheers to you lads keep on doing what you do godspeed,1,NOT
hi i am a kid middle school and my teacher said that trump is a womenizer and that women get payed less,1,NOT
there is gender wage gap just not in the us,1,NOT
this is an amazing video thank you so much,1,NOT
the question is why do they make the choices,1,NOT
so many based females referenced props,1,NOT
lool at  she just made a gender comparison and stated that it wasnt sexism just common sense common sense is probably why more women chose unfortunately i dont think individuals really have a choice in social environments they are in,1,NOT
based mom strikes again,1,NOT
talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice its my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legallybinding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality given the fact that lawmakers ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation,3,NOT
a little late for this video dude,1,NOT
what influences those choices made why do women not choose to go into those top  earning professions if you say its because they arent capable that makes you sexist if you say its because women are reinforced that they are less capable than men from as young as  years old which means they grow up to make those choices then you agree with science,1,NOT
i get what youre saying but i think the wage gap argument is meant to be broader than what you are talking about in the video the gap is not  cents big but there is still a gap i am not saying women and men have to do every occupation  but the choices women make in terms of going to lower paying jobs is partly due to some sexism in the workplace and society at large a women might want to go into aerospace engineering for example but if she is geared from a young age to play with dolls and take care of things she will slowly go into that career path also the idea of going into a field with mostly men will be daunting because their definitley still is sexism in the workplace guys can easily become friends with one another and move up while a girl in an office full of boys will probably have a hard time playing her chess moves and moving up it is all these little things the wage gap conversation is about its not only about the  cents argument because that is not correct but more so about the extra hurdles women face in the workplace combined this with that fact women have the abilty to get pregnant and deal wiht childcaring makes matters more complex and will affect thier pay,1,NOT
yes thats right  the choice is the difference a woman is expected to take care of children and run the household of course she is not willing to work on call of course she is less willing to move  a man expects from his wife to follow him wherever he find a better job but a woman cant expect her husband to follow her where she finds better job as for the dangerous jobs the reasoning is the same  the woman thinks that she has a duty toward the children and this duty precedes any high salary soooo if and when a man begins take same responsibility toward children and household the gap will disappear but for now,1,NOT
this video is what we needed it proves that there is no gap in salary for men and women working for the same time we may not have attained equality in all aspects of life and society but it dosent mean that we dont need to pick our fights i think that is part of the reason modern feminists are seen as radical and such however i dont know about the situation outside of the states and canada so i cannot be sure about it,1,NOT
an nra tv ad on this video  yeah youtube get your shit together,1,NOT
thank you for this video,1,NOT
i work for myself so i dont care be an entrepreneur and none of this matters,1,NOT
part of being an educational venue is presenting the facts and allowing the audience to draw the most reasonable conclusion prager university sets a mandate on what youre allowed to think right at the title,1,NOT
the so called wage gap is just femanist lies rd wave femanism isnt about equality its about female dominance and getting special privileges femanism is cancer,5,ABU
prageru once you factor in choice the wage gap shrinks to  cents me ok prageru the  cents only exists because of different choices me,1,NOT
how much of the gap is explained by the lack of standardized paid maternal leave in the us thats one of the main things i was hoping to find out im not angling for a certain number or anything if its negligible thats fine but i was hoping it would get mentioned if only briefly,1,NOT
im a tree,1,NOT
i always understood these real factors,1,NOT
so sjw is waging war onchoice hahaha d,1,NOT
google did a study in thier own business and found out they were paying women more ,1,NOT
its not a women putting me down for being a white male yay ,1,NOT
starting from today its illegal in iceland for there to be a gender wage gap,1,NOT
 great so its not that women are victims of sexist paying its that theyre just victims of sexist hiring and educational procedures just wonderful clearly this completely debunks sexism in our society,1,NOT
in some cases women make more,1,NOT
but my professer said youre wrong reeeeeeee,1,NOT
individual career choices that men or women make or is it that people are mike likely to increase the position and salaries of men than women ,1,NOT
either way everyone loves their mother and no amount of money can pay for that,1,NOT
this lady just sold her soul to do a propaganda video for the far right if up to them women could not vote but should be happy how sad women deserve better even this lady ,3,NOT
there is no wage gap but i wish to god there was if so i could just hire women exclusively take out a huge salary while paying them less than i would a man doing the same job and be surrounded by women all day every day charlies angels style,2,NOT
this channel is what i was searching for for years,1,NOT
interesting explanation but the false wage gap at  should be  cents instead of  if im not mistaken,1,NOT
there are  types of conservativesrightwinger in the world the wealthy ones the clever ones and the gullible ones and its the wealthy ones who pay the clever ones to convince the gullible ones that its all the fault of immigrants the poor and the big bad government guess which ones paid for this to be made guess who made it now guess whos gullible enough to believe it this entire page is a rightwing propaganda page,2,NOT
i cant believe people actually buy into this shit,2,NOT
you know i do recall wanting to take more psych classes because that was the major where the girls were at however i was the fly on the wall of a few conversations where male hiring managers did discuss how between two candidates they female would be cheaper but you could depend on the male the decision was to hire the male because they valued dependability as mentioned in this video over saving the company a few hundred dollars a decision they felt would cost them more in the long run it was only one instance but i know it couldnt be the only instant in the world were that discussion was held behind closed doors and i know somewhere down the line the choice of cost would be valued more than dependability a non profit i worked for valued the latter but the boss terrorized the employees by threatening the boot if they werent dependable at every corner a male worker there was discovered to be making more than his female replacement who was wonderful and very dependable but sadly underpaid for her service these videos have great facts but miss that there is an element a bias human element that does come into play when it comes to wages my wife also suffered this while working retail where a male counter part at her same level did less work but was paid higher and my wife was very dependable shit so dependable that we barely saw each other due to the demand of the job,1,NOT
if only the facts mentioned in this video applied for my country ,1,NOT
i used to work for the city of sunnyvale i was hired at the same time as a man of the same age for a lateral position i had a four year degree in the field of my job he had a two year degree he was awarded a salary k higher than me when i asked why i was told it was because he had a child he also had a big brother with tenure who also worked for the municipality women are discriminated against there is sexism,1,NOT
i showed this video to a feminist at my school shes no longer a feminist lowers glasses yyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaah,2,NOT
i dont buy this there is a lot of unsaid information regarding choiceand the unconscious bias that exists in the world it is perpetuated in the media in the schools at home girls are good at x and not at y so saying a girl has a choice to enter a stem related field blatently ignors the fact that girls are not encouraged like boys are encouraged to enter these higher paying fields,1,NOT
perhaps we should ask why the overwhelming femalefilled fields get paid so little in the first place for instance why does our society place so little economic value on education a female dominated field if one studies the history of waged labor the genesis of capitalism and womens roles within that system we see that all of the work that has ever been womens work gets paid less because we think it is worth less sometimes not even paid for at all as is in the case of domestic house work i am calling upon michel foucaults analysis of s europe and the rise of capitalism and waged labor as is talked about in the history of sexuality volume  silvia federici also talks about this in chapter  of caliban and the witch women were subjugated into the economic machine as unpaid domestic labor while the work of men was waged this gave men the power to feed and house themselves and their wives while the women had no power of independence from their husbands because they couldnt make money that legacy continues on today in a world where we still feel on some level that womens work should be free pragerus analysis also doesnt mention how women cant just move to other cities because they are tied down by dependent children and other social roles within families that men are not as often entangled in this is another arena of unpaid womens work that is brushed aside and made invisible within the realm of the private sphere as opposed to the waged public sphere within which men more often work and of course there is the well known fact that stem areas are not always welcoming spaces to women and in fact can be quite hostile do we all remember the google employee who argued that women are biologically less capable of stem work than men a video that prageru itself also produced and distributed the hypocrisy and can we not recognize the role of generalized misogyny in all of this as well being a woman entails being in a world where you are constantly sexualized from the time you hit puberty perhaps even earlier most women recount the first time that they were sexually hit upon by a man at about the age of  in an executive world dominated by men we have seen that women are often objectified and sexualized rather than treated as human subjects peers and creators of worth this is a fact that has been increasingly uncovered within the metoo movement perhaps we should talk about the psychological impact of having a boss or professor that sexualizes you and how that impacts your academic and career choices and there lies the key word choices the idea of pure choice is an illusion often harked upon by the right wing and the neoliberal minded the idea that you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps something that literally defies the natural laws of physics and that the psychological reality of living within a patriarchical world as a woman is inconsequential and effortlessly surmountable as much as you glorify the individual who can defy the odds the sociological fact is that you end up with this  cents on the dollar statistic across the board again perhaps its not that women choose low paying jobs but perhaps that a the material reality of patriarchy does in fact push women towards certain career choices and b the more woman that enter a field the less those jobs pay in the end of the day there needs to be a better reconciliation between the feminist academia and right wing think tanks like prageru these ideas do need to spar head on because without direct contradiction it seems like either side can pick and choose statistics and theories to prove whatever point they want to make case and point being this video i think the arguments i made here validly complicate the above video and in fact nullify most of its arguments that women earning less is because they choose to,1,NOT
i have noticed that the media outlet websites like the bbc for example that are so keen on drumming the gender wage gap story over  over again have disabledremoved the comments section on their socalled news articles why to stop people from being able to rebuff their lies a simple post with a link to this youtube video could educate so many people but oh no you cant do that you cant tell the truth or even just present the facts the science the logic anymore that is not allowed these days great video,1,NOT
holy shit someone other than a man made a video on this,1,NOT
try explaining this to a feminist  your likely to get pepper sprayed,2,NOT
she has really large and shiny eyes but it suits her face structure,1,NOT
its kinda sad that it took a whole video for someone to understand im  and ive understood this concept i mean its illegal to pay someone less based on the sexgenderor age but half brained feminazis idk if i spelled that right want to go and say oh i heard someone on tv say this so cut every mans dick off btw i liked the video this isnt a negative comment lol,1,NOT

not only does a wage gap exist but it is engrained in our culture explaining them away as individual choices ignores cultural pressures and child development one study i performed using multivariable calculations showed that the gender gap amongst college professors was non existant however simpler mathematics showed that higher paying universities hired more men than women and the higher paying colleges amongst those universities employed more men than women also the states that payed higher wages to college professors tended to hire more men than women this study took into account tenure education title publications age etc it was a small study but it did show a significant wage gap according to gender,1,NOT

christina is awesome,1,NOT
lets be honest modernthird wave feminist arent feminist but simply sexist feminist fought and advocate womans rights but this new third wave era fight and advocate superiority,3,NOT
after watching  there is no gender wage gap it has left me with a lot of questions and some clarification on certain things this video proves that there is a gender wage gap but it also clarifies where and how there is a gap between women and men pay i think that the main thing that is being overlooked would be that not all women can work full time or half the time that men do because of child care and other obligations that they have as a woman usually it is just known that woman do all the housework and childcare while the man is out working and making money why dont women get paid the same amount that men do especially when they are doing more work then just their employed job if the situation was flipped and women got paid more i dont think that men would let it go by as easily as the women do not by choice but that its just what the case is with professional soccer in general whether male or female it has a lot of work put into it the video why is womens soccer so white it points out a lot of things that differ from men and women professional soccer teams the pay gap with men and women ties into the soccer world because men get paid a lot more than the women do and the fact of the matter is that the women bring home more titles than the men a quote in the reading paid disparity in us soccer that stood out to me is equal pay for equal work is this not a true statement just because the womens team are women and not men so in the end is it just sexism taking a tole,1,NOT
please explain how when the womens soccer team wins the world cup make less money when men lose it,1,NOT
christina hoff sommers is the one who milo mention as a source,1,NOT
there isnt any wage gap in the businesses but there is a skill and experience gap between the genders in the society some of this gap is caused by biology some are caused by social pressure,1,NOT

these arguments sound pretty familiar but pretty good video nonetheless,1,NOT
my favorit video on the internet,1,NOT
looking fwd to that vegan couple doing a video on trish ,1,NOT
this isint bulletproof like most people say at least in what is seen in this video alone the real takeaway at least the one i got is that wemen prefer eaiser less time consuming jobs to men the real question then becomes why why do they act this way if its simple biology then it seems as if even though a wage gap does exist its not due to any controllable factors but what if its for another reason what it wemen act this way beacuse of societys expectations if thats the case then there really is still work feminists have to do to make wemen feel more at ease in workplaces personally i think thats not supported at all from what we know about female biology but like she says there are so many variables and answers im not willing to count that argument  out yet,1,NOT
this bitch is probably being paid less than dudes filming these videos but here we are,5,ABU

ohkay so first argument the choice one you are saying that first the people oppress and condition women to  take care of children and not do a job at all and then if they decide they enforce the idea of so called the job of a woman now this people is the real illusion of choice stop thinking aliens are controlling us first fight this oppression then well develop weapons against those aliens this is part one ill post comments as i see the video and give arguments,1,NOT
someone send this to amy schumer,1,NOT
the fact that this still has to be explained is just pathetic they never have answers for why companies dont hire more women if women get paid less than men they always talk about wanting to see more women in certain jobs but theyre always these high paying low risk jobs its never coal mining or working on off shore oil rigs or anything like that they go on and on about wanting to see more women in stem fields like theres some agenda by the patriarchy which doesnt exist to keep women out of those jobs it couldnt possibly be that women just dont want to go into those fields right they want to see women represented everywhere except the loudest hottest and most dangerous jobs because equality,1,NOT
f you dont think that by being man you are not gonna be more wealthy just take a look on average wealth by sexes,1,NOT
are there any citations for the studies used id love to save them very useful during debates,1,NOT
this brings about a point that women feel pressured to not presue further education and education in the higher paying jobs does this raise a point that there is a problem with how we raise children and what paths they are guided down,1,NOT
i have a small construction company and i know for a fact that i will get more productivity and therefore more profit out of male workers if the women could get the same amount of work done for less i would have no problem having a company full of them but in reality if i did that my company would probably go bankrupt and id have wild sexual harassment claims against me for telling them to work harder,2,NOT

an important info at   men are more willing and able to work long hours indeed and that might be the problem i would love to work longer hours a lot more fun than changing diapers trust me but someone has to come home to the kids and still today the mother is expected to do so if fathers would share the load of taking care of the kids equally with the mothers whatever gap that might exist would disappear,1,NOT
hi guys i need to find the hard data from the us government on the wage gap i know its out there i read it before but i cant seem to be able to find it anyone know where it is it was a pdf of all the data,1,NOT
can somebody link me the study mentioned in the beginning of the video,1,NOT
i worked in a predominantly male industry for over  years and made more money than most of the men and women in our group the reason why is because i was single and had no family commitments i was willing to work the long hours and do standby everyone else had family commitments they needed to pickup kids at daycare or go to a school event the women were always taking time off because their kids were sick and thus not dependable i found the women were always complaining about how they didnt get paid enough but were never able to admit that it was because they were unable to put in the extra work to get the raises they always wanted to blame it on sexism,1,NOT
up next why black lives matter is a dangerous organisation as told by an actual black man,1,NOT
yay vegan ftw,1,NOT
omg im sooo happy,1,NOT
this is a really good video freelee ,1,NOT
here are some factors on why men tend to earn more   men choose higher paying jobs women tend to focus on jobs caring for others  teachers nurses daycare home health workers etcwhile men enjoy stem fields which are higher paying  men put in more hours at work than women do and therefore are earning more if paid by the hour or earn more in commissions for making more sales  because men put in more hours and maybe work nights and weekends they get more experience and are therefore more valuable which justifies pay raises and promotions  women often leave the workforce to have kids this means that whenif they return they have to start from scratch while the men who were hired originally with the women have been promoted  women arent as aggressive in negotiating their pay when hired andor promoted nor are they as aggressive in seekingdemanding promotions  women are more likely to stay with a company that turned them down for a raisepromotion they are risk adverse men are less afraid of risk and will look elsewhere if they are passed over for a promotion or are denied a raise companies know this and therefore are more likely to give men that raisepromotion rather than face the higher risk of them leaving  since women work less than men companies arent going to offer women promotions if the promotion would require them to work longer hours women wont accept such promotions as often as men and the companies know that she is likely to turn it down so they offer it to the equally qualified man rather than having the man knowing that he was the nd choice  since women tend to seek husbands who earn more than they do women are much more likely to have a higher earning spouse than a man this means that the women will be less likely to accept a promotion requiring more timetravel since she may not need the money as much as the man with a lower earning spouse the womans husband is also less likely to accept the wife being on the job more hours and he will also be less willing to move if the womans promotion requires it he may not be able to make the same money if the new town while the spouse of the male employee will be much more likely to find similar paying work these factors discourage women from accepting such promotions and knowing this the company is also less likely to offer it to a woman over an equally qualified man  women with higher earning husbands feel less pressure to enter less attractive but higher paying fields they gravitate to jobs that they like men tend to have lower earning spouses and therefore are forced to choose higher paying jobs even if its much less enjoyable all of the above show why men on an annual basis earn more than women there is nothing that attributes the difference to sexism its all about personal choices that men and women freely make,2,NOT
if this video took a look at if there was equal opportunities for women to actually get the higher paying jobs i think the consensus that prageru came to would have been different,1,NOT
it should be called an earnings gap which basically comes down to women wanting to be paid for the traditionally free labour they provided at home before entering the work force the left needs to stop insisting that there is a gender wage gap and the right like this video needs to stop saying that everything is equal because it isnt,1,NOT
 feminist dont like facts bcz it doesnt support their views,2,NOT
feminism is a myth,1,NOT
i am so glad that i am among the few who have common sense,1,NOT
i know im gonna sound like a complete idiot to all the people who believe this video but youre just basing everything on a video that has no sources to what theyre saying and people say that all the butthurt feminists disliked this let me just clarify im a male not trans bi gay or anything like that before im gonna hear any excuse on why im wrong for being a feminist that wants more than just equality one point that i see is not very believable is that it has to do with career choices im pretty sure no matter the career choice a person makes there is always a man at that job that you can compare the money gap in unless were talking about strippers those are separated if they just based it on all women then yes of course the money amount would be less but its not about the career choice its about the money that a man and woman makes on the same job not on the career choice of both genders some countries the wage gap is almost not even there but ive had this explained by people who arent females just say im making this shit up for all i care i just want to get my statement across,1,NOT

its pretty simple all sporting event now have to add separate categories for competition well have boys basketball girls basketball transgender girls basketball and transgender boys basketball andyou do this for every sport that way competitors are going against others that are starting from the same biological starting point its ridiculous to have boysmen who identify as girlswomen to be competing against biological girlswomenand vice versa their personal preference as to their self identity sexuality etci could care less its their lifebut when it comes to organized competitionis has no place if you have the dna of a maleyou go compete against other males regardless of how you identify if you have the dna of a women go compete against other women regardless of if you identify as a male unless of course youre taking testosterone what is the point of sportif everyone isnt starting from a level playing field,5,ABU

look women have fought hard to have their place in sports and still are but its a difficult topic of is it fair to either group to me in strength and stamina women are at their own level and men have theirs however with these transgender students its difficult to know where their strengths place above or below the girls team a possible solution could be to make a group for transgender athletes one solution im against taking those transgender students completely out of sports because its not fair everyone has a right to partake in something that makes them happy its like with the first woman who ran in the boston marathon and she did it no man could stop her and no one should stop these kids from running i see the girls standpoint of fairness and i also see the transgirls standpoint of inclusiveness within the sport,2,NOT
they shouldnt even be called stars they have to compete with men they are grown men,5,ABU

who remembers trishas best coming out video where she said she identified as achicken nugget,2,NOT
that video already seems like another do dogs have brains video,2,NOT
as much as i think trisha is a nut case and no i personally dont think she is trans but we cannot put all transgender people in the same box that there is only one way that is works that everyone must feels the same way in their journey etc if there was a step by step to how it works it would be a hell of alot easier for people struggling we cannot tell people how they feel we never know what people are truly feeling or going through as much as trish is talking rubbish in my opinion we still dont know about the demons she fight inside herself which is what we all deal with at different levels every day no im not a fan of trish at all but people go through sht and i think we need to be sensitive to it,1,NOT
she had bpd and i do too i completely understand the identity crisis but she is  not trans,5,ABU
she is never not going to be a garbage fire,5,ABU
another awesome and hilarious video love you blaire,1,NOT

trisha made a new video she says shes questioning ,2,NOT
im starting to think you are just free advertising for chikfila,2,NOT
i want to believe anyone who says they are transgender or that they have been raped just because they say so most of my life i have done that in these recent years when people have publicly declared that we have to believe everyone who says they are transgender or have been raped i think it is difficult to do so once you publicly declare you will believe someone you are just publicly recruiting pathological liars they cant even help it its our fault for publicly declaring unconditional and absolute belief,2,NOT
been waiting for this video since the second trisha offended the whole world ,2,NOT
with trishas logic every straight guy that is attracted to a lesbian is also a transsexual lesbian,3,NOT

though this person is obviously an imbecile i do believe i could challenge you in debate regarding the question as to whether being okay with your born sex disqualifies one from identifying as the other being trans is a different category of discernment but i am an example of the aforementioned consideration being not only possible but extant,5,ABU

i was in love with my gay bff i was happy he felt comfortable coming out to me  being true but i loved him a very sad time for my  year old heart,1,NOT
could you do more political stuff instead of trans stuff,2,NOT
shes definitely not trans lol,5,ABU
trisha the whole transgender community has always like called me for some reason the trans community yall hear sumn,2,NOT
honest question though are you against identifying as nonbinary because thats the vibe im getting from you,2,NOT
if shes attracted to emotionally and physically unavailable men then she needs to sort out her committment and self worth issues out with a cognitive behavioral therapist and not be mouthing off nonsense on social media shes is an insult to people actually struggling with this situation she needs to be ignored,5,ABU
all about that chick fil a though,2,NOT
lol trisha is stupid,5,ABU
this is fucked up no matter if shes trolling or not if she is trolling she just ended her career and made transpeople look like a joke on purpose if shes not trolling she will actually feel dysphoria if shes going to transition,5,ABU
women and men come in all shades of feminine and masculine they are still a woman or a man its  we should wake up and realise women can be all kinds of women and men can be all kinds of men you dont have to put a trans label on it because its fashionable,1,NOT
sometimes i go months without watching one your videos then i watch one and i regret the last few months thats all,3,NOT
i dont want to sound mean or like im bodyshaming but it looks like somebody hit trisha in the face with a shovel repeatedly,5,ABU
i commented once before and its going to sound like im saying this hostile and im not at all but you telling her how this works how a transgender should be where you have stated in a past video you still have your penis and what have you down there because you would mourn the loss so does that mean youre not fully transgender you still want to hold on to some male parts because you would mourn the loss so obviously you dont know exactly how it works either i dont either but apparently its still open for debate what transgender is and what it isnt and how many genders there are so again not with any animus at all here but who gives you the right to say shes not doing it right and youre doing it right not a hater just wondering why you feel youre an expert at it because you have a lot of followers would love to hear a true answer and not somebody cussing me out you want to be accepted like everyone else and be a normal person i got it but here youre squashing someone else who obviously is got issues and isnt dealing with it well but at least trying to express it i dont think you should be jumping down on a lost soul what gives you the right to say  what the fuck thats not how it works  ,2,NOT
this is vodka by the way bruh that sent me,1,NOT
that was a nice video but please consider not eating in videos anymore is sounds really annoying,2,NOT
trish looks so unhealthy like not only too much botox but also just sick her skin is blotchy and pale her lips are an odd color she looks dehydrated her eyes are sinking in farther every video and she looks like she has a crack addiction she knows how much attention her mental breakdowns get her and that means more ads im not sure if she actually needs help or shes just playing it up for the camera,2,NOT
i find it hypocritical to say trisha isnt trans when were suppose to believe youre a woman just because you went full frankenstein youre both nutty,5,ABU
does ur bf count,2,NOT
muscles glistening in the wind lololol love it,2,NOT
oh god now onision is going to claim he is trans,3,NOT
love you blaire i was waiting for this obv shes trolling theres no way shes trans  no one was talking about her and her cross eyed tits so she had to come up with something to get attention i think shes hilarious but is she trans no way,5,ABU
blaire  as always  u nailed it and u did with class  and class is something trish is lacking among rapidly loosing brain functions  love from canada,5,ABU

ive never watched her content and her comments made my brain stuttet and reboot,5,ABU
shes gotta be trolling that was so bad,2,NOT
not trans maybe schizophrenic,5,ABU
i think something ppl should remember is everybodys walk to finding who they areis different i went through a time where i thought i was bi before i even knew what it meant i told people but i have never been with a chick over time i realized i was confused on my identity which makes sense for the mental illness i struggle with it could be a similar thing,1,NOT
cant you do porn instead,5,ABU
damn ad had the perfect timing do i identify with my naturalborn gender  then immediately after coming this holloween,2,NOT
i am not sure wtf she is is she a girl that want to be male or is she a male looking like a girl ugliest girl ive ever seen maybe she looks beter as a boy,5,ABU
trisha is terrifying to behold shes an orc that identifies as a human,5,ABU
not gonna lie i cackled when the video started and blaire was sitting on her kitchen floor ,2,NOT
i like how you were eating chickfila for this situation but yeah transha is godamn fujoshi,5,ABU

i havent seen the new video yet but omg shes lost it i agree if she actually were trans she would not be  ok being born female,5,ABU
ive found most gay men attractive but it doesnt mean im a gay man  like wtf trish,2,NOT

this stupid confusion over gender and sexuality its two separate issues,3,NOT
yes i agree its sexism and the p envy buy a strap on with those ad sense coins and call it a day im fucking rolling on the ground laughing so hard girl you are funny,5,ABU
man youre kind of hypocritical i dont love that about you i constantly see you judging how others look and the things they say but you seem to be lacking your own self awareness you are entitled and you have no right to be a judgemental bitch sorry not sorry,5,ABU
mancheeze the great made a video on ya you should respond to the terf,2,NOT
i agree with most of the things said in here and btw you are beautiful but when people come out as whatever they want to come out as wether its trans bisexual gay etc they dont necessarily have to talk about it  some people are more shy and like to keep their sexuality as something personal especially big actors like jaden smith and some youtubers so sometimes they just want to let their fanbase know more about them and just because they announced it does not mean that they have to mention their sexuality in every conversation ya feel but hey thats just my opinion i definitely think that trish is either a troll or that she genuinely needs help,3,NOT
i love you blair ,1,NOT
do i have a brain  am i trisha paytas ,3,NOT
the one thing im confused about is that some days i really hate my body and want to not have boobs and be flat and have a penis and just be a guy but i know im not trans i do like being a girl but i also do want and like looking and acting more masculine and even have the features as a guy idk i wish i had a character making hud for me where i can just change my gender whenever i wanted  can some one help me explain how i feel,2,NOT
she accomplished what she wanted though attention,3,NOT
shes just trying to make rent this month,3,NOT
when i heard about this trisha situation i watched the video then i saw your video in the related and watched it thinking that it was a trans person that believes there an actual woman or any of that sjw stuff obviously i was wrong and ive been binging your videos i like and agree with your perspective and i like your sense of humor as well keep up the good work,1,NOT
the amount of times i had to pause and just process what she said,2,NOT
she sounds more like shes experiencing gender fluidity,2,NOT
whats a crow mukbang,1,NOT
you need brain cells first to lose them ,3,NOT
she knows what shes doing,3,NOT
just a questionyou like saying to diff trans people that they are not trans not that i am defending trish payatasbut wellwho the hell made you the authority of who is trans or not how do we know you are really trans you say you are transbut how do we know you are really trans maybe you have been pulling a fakeout just for views and attention,5,ABU
what pronouns does she prefer dumbdumber,5,ABU
shes at it as well,3,NOT
her face is so fucked up,6,ABU
her video honestly was embarrassing these sorts of people really need to stop making such a joke of the lgbtq community these days its seriously just for attention for some people and its a slap in the face for people who have actually struggled with things like coming out and figuring yourself out which i have personally done go get help trisha jesus christ,5,ABU
i think its a troll i never take her seriously,3,NOT
so you said masculinity and femininity are not genders but then you say so inject testosterone and cut your hair to prove youre dealing with dysphoria alrighti usually stand by everything you say  but this just confuses me,3,NOT
lmao i was waiting to see what blaire thought of this nonsense,5,ABU
i love you blaire youre such is a bad bitch,5,ABU

you have a much sexier face than trisha the brain cell warrior,5,ABU
using sweetie in a sentence is pretty womanly,2,NOT
transtrender i label myself as a woman because im kind of a ditz tee hee feminists the fuck you say boy,5,ABU
i wish i had more people like you growing up i had a lot of people like trisha tell me because i wasnt stereotypical woman that i was trans,3,NOT
blair is everything i aspire to be ,1,NOT
literally almost all the trans youtubers i watch posted vids about her lmao trish is so fing dumb,5,ABU
its funny how a week ago she uploaded a super sexual video about how she likes to eat boys with her tits hanging out and then shes going to cry and say how she hates her female body and shes really a man ,3,NOT
female body builders still wear super effeminate clothing and makeup even though people would say not me to be clear they look like men top beauty gurus and makeup artists out here are men were at the precipice of stopping conformity purely by gendersexuality and then trisha has to sit on her kitchen floor and talk a load on nonsense because she cant be bothered to take her money and go see a therapist to work all that out,5,ABU
shes always looking for attention and she loves to make everything about her i dont hate her but i dont understand how people like that kind of content ,3,NOT
trishas doing anything to try and stay relevant,3,NOT
i kinda see where shes coming from though she identifies with her birth sex but she thinks of her energy as a male i dont think she meant that shes actually trans she probably just doesnt know the correct label for what shes feeling,3,NOT
trisha is a troll you sitting on the kitchen floor had me rolling ,3,NOT
oh youre into gay guys wow thats you and damn near every other woman on earth for clarification watch shoe on head video on  questions women have for men in particular the point about why men are into lesbians,3,NOT
trisha is a troll how tf do people not understand this yet its all she does nobody should take her seriously ever,5,ABU

gigi has a pipi ,5,ABU
forget trishas delusions tha fuck wrong with her face,5,ABU
that intro was a mood,1,NOT
random side note although conservatives are annoyed with it im still surprised to see blair eating and promoting chic file as they actively fund anti lgbt groups aka anti blair i was like whatever when i thought it was just the owner saying he doesnt agree with gay people but once i found out my money would indirectly be going to anti lgbt groups thats when i stopped going to chic file,1,NOT
first kalvin then ryan now you whos not going to cover her next p,2,NOT
question for blaire when i hear the term transgender and of course the first person i think about is you i find the term no longer applies to you as far as i can tell youve finished your transformation meaning youre no longer a mf transitioner and anything else you do be it oh idk liposuction nose job bigger titty implants anything short of the salami slice none of those things except the last which i selectively put a condition on are going to create a secondary sex characteristic that you dont already have i mean youre gorgeous and you know it lets not bullshit with each other reason i say this is because some of these other unicorn genders were see like justin dennis nonbinary trans woman bullshit or any of the other transtrender assholes youve dissected in your videos there certainly have been a lot of them they wouldnt qualify as trans either since they are making a declaration of an imaginary gender and have no intention on transitioning to a male or a female meaning the term trans is a meaningless word which i must say is not only offensive to my intelligence but should be offensive to your integrity as a transitioned male to female ill just call you female from here on but i think you get what i mean if not ill clarify,2,NOT
this makes me hungry for chickfila,1,NOT
maybe she has a personality disorder or not  i dont know  but she does need help for sure,5,ABU
im a female woman chick etc  thank you blaire white  its wierd but yea  cant deny or understand it but i feel more support from you than any feminist ive ever met ,2,NOT
did it have a stroke her face is all stroked out,5,ABU
 i consistently get the oh my god i didnt know you were straight it hurts especially when my first interaction with them is normally flirty maybe if i follow trishas logic im a transgender stripper,3,NOT
muscles are glistening in the wind id buy that shirt,1,NOT
booom girl i love your no nonsense attitude snap you tell it like it is im a straight cis female and youre the bomb,1,NOT
its very obviously a trolling vid people need to just move on she does these things every few months when her socialblade slows,2,NOT
i love trisha i have since i was  an im almost  now ive seen her when she was still stripping an was a escort ive seen the changes in her i feel like shes never had a healthy view of herself or the world if that makes any sense just like few years ago she came out an said she has a baby it was a black baby doll actually acted like michael jackson an hung over a balcony in one of her videos idk i feel like sometimes she just likes to act like her people thats her thing i noticed who ever shes around she becomes them almost also i feel like shed been better off saying shes more androgynous that likes femm boys idk maybe im wrong as well i do feel like she got a lot wrong in her video,2,NOT
i subscribed thank you for your content you help educate me in ways that people think are impossible ive been saying celebs coming out with all of their different identifications has been for clout but everyone likes slapping me with the homophob or sexist tags when im genuinely just like these celebs are doing it for clout,2,NOT
i already had lunch but all that food is making me hungry again,1,NOT
 i think she meant thats something she struggles with as a woman when women are assertive its wrongly seen as being a bitch its a very common problem in workplaces but when men are assertive its just normal conversation its in the same realm as women being told to smile more but youd never say that to a man sooooo annoying,2,NOT
lets see in a years time if she has made any progress with transitioning,1,NOT
i dont have penis envy i have one and i am tired of women wanting one,3,NOT
and she came our as a chicken nugget and a teletubbie,3,NOT

so she likes metrosexual men ,3,NOT
stop everything queen blaire is speaking,1,NOT
was with you till you came for nonbinary people nothing is more ironic than trans people trying to invalidate other trans people just a tip not everyones experience is going to be like yours the sooner you realize that the closer our community is going to be but go off sis you obviously think you the trans gatekeeper ,5,ABU
trisha is literally insane i think she just doesnt want to be herself so is pretending to be something she isnt she is literally taking the piss out of trans people ,5,ABU

i feel attacked,2,NOT
when i heard about this drama i said this in my headblaires making a new video,1,NOT
didnt trish say she smoked meth before im not trusting anything she says,3,NOT
shes not trans but that would only mean she has another mental illness i genuinely think shes confused and tries to find her identity she doesnt have the vocabulary to express herself and thats why shes contradicting herself you cant cancel a human being she feels fluid and thats why she needs a therapist she doesnt have to apologise for her confusion just like we shouldnt believe her and we shouldnt think she lies because we dont know imagine if shes right then all of the hate right now is suicide fuel for her,5,ABU
by trishas definition i too am a gay man ,2,NOT
but u yourself have pointed out transgender ppl dont transition and transexual people do and thats the difference lol whatever gita your narrative i guess,2,NOT
im a  year old man who identifies as a  year old girl,2,NOT
im a gay man whos interested in gay men no shit and i can tell you honey tits and a vag definitely means youre not a gay man,3,NOT

shes always kept her channel and career alive by causing controversy and allowing people to bully and talk shit about her im one minute into the video and i can already tell its nothing new ,5,ABU
just wanted to clarify that ive been subscribed for  years now but somehow youtube unsubbed me so i had to sub back been happening alot lately and its so wierd,1,NOT
why are we even paying attention to trisha paytas all her vids are just attention whoring or a cry for help,5,ABU

oh thank god your not on this crazy train too you basically said everything that pissed me off about her video i feel like shes so lost that whoever shes around effects how she thinks and acts she needs help not youtube,2,NOT
i wish i was as creative as trish ,1,NOT
oh trisha you have to hand it to her she is very entertaining its like watching your dysfunctional friend mess up time and time again,5,ABU
i believe it could be that shes been so traumatized by men in her life that she thinks if she becomes one it will fix her pain i also think she might be in love with her gay best friend  shes been known to transform into whatever the guy shes interested wants shes admitted shes very prone to obsessing over things,2,NOT
so being transgender has less to do with sexual orientation and more with the feeling that you were born in the wrong body all the terms that are currently being used describe sexual preference sexual identity etc have me extremely confused i often feel like i require a handbook to help me grasp the most recent celebrity coming out,2,NOT
lol shes trolling calm down this isnt new,3,NOT
i strongly believe trisha is mentally ill shes always got some type of controversy going on and comes up with the most oddest things to say no way can she ever be taken seriously not even the lgbtq community could take this one seriously she needs help,5,ABU
their muscles are glistening in the wind ,2,NOT
blair can you answer a question are  for me why is it that most trans women seem that they do not respect the space of natural born women and why dont they want there own space i think it is very disrespectful and insulting to all women that trans women think that have the right to say they are real women cause the fact remains they are not it seems they dont even have pride in being trans they want to be a natural women but will not and can not ever be no disrespect its just fact common sense thanks for your time,5,ABU
unfortunately trisha is being a troll im so confused how people still even find her relevant this is exactly what she wanted everyone to do she has admitted so many times that she says these things to be a troll and have people make these videos and certainly not saying you shouldnt have bc i love all of your videos im just glad you uploaded anything lmao but i wish people would stop giving her what she wants so she can just sink into her vile little hole shes not a good person imo,5,ABU
shell blame this on drugs just like the whole chicken nugget thing,3,NOT
i actually thought tricia was mtf trans when i first saw one of her vids im not gonna lie lol,3,NOT

as a  year old trans man myself i couldnt even make it through the video i felt so hurt and invalidated the pain of dysphoria and knowing my family is secretly annoyed and angry that im bi and trans it sucks trisha is so privileged and doing this just for coin and its gross she needs to stay away and stop fetching minorities,3,NOT
 got a genuine laugh out of me xd,1,NOT
its all so confusing to us straights cis folks she may just be confused as everyone else,2,NOT
at this point or really any points of her career its obvious that shes using the troll reputation because she knows that if its too offensive and stuff there will always be those who will say shes just trolling and sweep it under the rug and she can comfortably gain views and clicks and whatever makes the money nowadays shes a troll is not an excuse explanation nor justification for her being a pathetic asshole,5,ABU
trisha and trainwreck both start with tcoincidence,5,ABU
god fucking dammit i hate this fat bitch trisha paytas not only do i have a hard time sympathizing with transgenders as it is but this bitch is just using another victimized group to gain attention fuck her,5,ABU
shes a troll she likes the attention lol,3,NOT
not gonna lie blaire is so hot love it,1,NOT
umi think this along with most of her issues stem fm a deep deep seeded childhood traumaissue im a firm believer in freuds theory that childrens personalities develope through the  stages freud proposed that psychological development in childhood takes place during five psychosexual stages oral anal phallic latency and genital i think something happened during trishas early childhoodaround  or yrs old and im not saying sexual abuse though im not ruling that out but something happened and thats why she has no self controlher id gets what her id wants she has stated she needs sex  to  times a day that she just pulsates for no reason and needs sex often she goes into self destruction mode when in a relationship and fm the start of a relationship starts pushing that person away while at the same time being super ultra clingyhas talked about her drug use her drinking her eating addictionher impulsivityher being attractive to way older men and i think it all goes back to her early childhood i just wonder what the fuck her therapist talks to her about she needs a doctor to delve into her mindnot just a therapist she needs a psychologist,5,ABU
blair was problematic in the past but a bitch has grown and we stand for her wokeness ,3,NOT
i dont understand is this trix person a female or male,3,NOT
trisha trying so hard to stay relevant lol,3,NOT
your pronouns are that bitch you got me rolling with laughter,5,ABU
holy shit trisha needs to quit the botox,5,ABU
i agree luv trisha but im finding myself slowly moving away from her with all do respect if she truly is with i think she isnt at the moment transgender i will support her unconditionally but using the trans community for views and attention is never okay and it is something trisha is prone to doing jumping onto trends and saying random ass shit for views xyz but at the end of the day nobody defines the transgender every body is different and responds to figuring themselves out in a different way there are male to female straight women male to female gay women male to female a and the exact same for female to male she has every right to come out but definitely has no right to use being trans for growth it truly can be either or we all know nothing is yet to be confirmed i know this is all over the place but i just dont know how to explain my opinion in another way than this in conclusion well see,3,NOT
queen of rational thinking does it again ms blaire white ,1,NOT
i dont think she is trans because she contradicting herself and she identified as gay black and chicken nugget its makes people not believe her she entertaining but i cant rust shit she says compared trans folks ik who explained there transition doesnt line up she seems more either she has some internally hate societal expectation of womeninternal sexism or confused i am very un traditional woman im assertive career driven etc but doesnt make less of women also most people make an effort to social transition or physical,3,NOT
i literally have a headache trying to figure this chick out transgender no honey you arent transgender although you probably need some help,5,ABU
lol i loved this video trisha is such a train wreck and a lot of us cant look away from it i know ive seen a lot of her videos but its not because im a real fan its more because shes such a a wreck,3,NOT

too much botox and fillers have affected their brain shes such a moron,5,ABU
if this is trolling i have no idea what trolling is anymore,2,NOT
all the extreme shit she does is an act she is trying to be the most extreme controversial person so everyones talking about her and she gains attention and more money any attention is good attention for her since she doesnt have any real talent,5,ABU
this is vodka by the way  blaire keeps it so real and hit every point perfectly yes girl,2,NOT
ohhhhh my god im so fucking tired she must be trolling right like its still really fuckin disrespectful to capitalize on transgenderism but like i just cant bring myself to believe that shes not trolling being a top isnt the same thing as being a man trisha jfc i need a shot,5,ABU

she should pursue a career as a dominatrix and get back to us in a few months to see how she feels lol,5,ABU
oh my god girl the first  seconds had me dead ,3,NOT
love this video but also dont agree that sam smith and jonathan van ness coming out as non binary was for attentionclicks being non binary is not a fad and super didnt appreciate it coming off that way for non binary folks that may be watching this,2,NOT
how does one go from a lesbian to a trans gay male tf,3,NOT

i havent even watched video i want to be straight up and be honest i think she does have a body dysmorphia i think theres something wrong with her however i dont think she is transgender i think that shes trying to find an answer for whats wrong with her and she thinks its this i dont think shes doing it for views or to make a mockery of the community and it took me a lot to say this because i dislike her a lot,3,NOT
my pronouns are that bitch  i love it,3,NOT
gigi is right though,1,NOT
oh blaire you make me laugh,1,NOT

trishas video is just nasty she makes coming out as trans look like a fun thing to do and all of us can say its not fun i lost my guy friends because they couldnt understand anything i was going through they were my best friends we were inseparable and now i see them hanging out doing all the things we did together things i showed them without me coming out as trans isnt fun it sucks that it is the way it is but for most people they risk almost everything when they come out trisha is literally just hunting for clicks and its gross shes profiting off of our pain,5,ABU
trisha is a genius by starting a conversation and using satire in her video she is a smart troll,3,NOT
as a cis bi girl my attraction to masc women and trans guys are different because one group is women and the other is men i cant really explain it but like they are two separate things in my mind and its very clear to me,1,NOT
shes just confused like when someone is contemplating if they are transgender,3,NOT
why do you even care,1,NOT

to be fair trisha has been known for trolling her audience for views,3,NOT
every time trisha gets kinda irrelevant she makes a weird video and she becomes relevant again if crying on the kitchen floor doesnt work anymore she suddenly becomes transgender d haha brilliant,3,NOT

im a guy who as always liked cars and animals so i must be a mustang,2,NOT
the wage gap shrinks but its still there,1,NOT
first of all if you know trisha you know that she is definitely just shitposting and unfortunately for her its completely blown up and gone too far and now shes cant turn back without being completely cancelled second of all i find it shocking the way the lgbtq community prestigious members of the community have reacted to the news the way most people have reacted to her completely contradicts to what they normally preach about transgender people they will allow predators to convince themselves and others that they can get periods and pms even though they have male genitalia  but when a known troll comes out suddenly theyre offended i know trisha just as well as the next person but what if she actually does have gender dysphoria and this is how the hypocrites that are social justice warriors react if anything shes exposing the hypocrisy within the lgbtq online community,3,NOT
i am so shook i was literally in the process of commenting you need to do a reacting to gigi gorgeous reaction and there it was,1,NOT

man that bitch is awesome,3,NOT
blair i just want to say a few things one i didnt know anything about you until i seen a video you did about yaniv when i seen that video i started watching a lot of your other videos you opened my eyes to transgenders and it is solely you why i am able to accept the transition and why transgenders do so at first i was afraid for my daughters using public bathrooms for fear of them seeing a man urinating in a urinal because of you i realized that would probably never happen and it alleviated my fear and it grew acceptance in my heart when you denounced yaniv which was my worst nightmare as a mother of three girls i instantly respected you for calling it out and how much you went out of your way and even put yourself in danger to hold yaniv accountable i fell in love with you because of that not love as in romantic but love as in the way i love my family and children i have agreed with you on every video you have done including this one i love candace owens and i agreed with both of you but i had to admit you held your own with her which is hard for a lot of people and you eloquently stood firm to your beliefs thank you for being you and explaining yourself and your thoughts the way you do in my eyes you have paved the way for people like me who dont quite understand the transgender transformations to understand and even able to lovingly accept everyone you are truly a lovely woman and keep shining your light and love to the world,1,NOT

im not trans so i felt it wasnt my place to say  but i really dont think shes trans,3,NOT
honey i recently got into a twitter fight with a non binary retard saying they were trans and were saying that youre transphobic i just these ppl i just cant blaire i fucking cant,5,ABU
trisha is the best troll even though i know shes trolling i still click on it and forget for a second that she most likely doesnt mean it,3,NOT

i was waiting for your hot take,1,NOT
your irony never gets old ,1,NOT
trisha really tried it ,2,NOT
what got bleeped at ,1,NOT
thank you for pointing out that even if shes trolling shes actually speaking and acting the way many many people do earnestly i cant remember that little creature that was riley denniss friend but she popped to mind so many girls act like this and as someone who used to read a lot of yaoi comics online a lot of the female creators transitioned simply because they fetishized gay guys its actually a thing that happens but some of them end up doing the whole testosterone thing which is really unhealthy and then detransition huge waste of time and resources also thank you for not claiming to actually be a real girl other trans people i watched try to claim this that they were real men despite being born women and trisha was not like honey why did you have to transition then i love you and your channel because you dont deny the reality of your birth and existence and i think that makes you happier in your own way than other trans people who cannot accept the reality of their situations,2,NOT
hey i enjoy your videos what is your sign,1,NOT
dude wtf did she just say,2,NOT
someone left a comment on her video and it was so true identifying with men is not the same as identifying as a man,1,NOT
im not trans but i felt offended by trishas video did she want people like me to be offended probably is it still a bad video from trisha well all of her videos are bad in my humble opinion so,3,NOT
early crew love you blaire ,1,NOT
lol trisha is hilarious i think shes trolling people,2,NOT
this is vodka btw is my mood  great video blaire,1,NOT
brilliant vid and ily  i do wish that everyone would be a little less cynicaljust a tadand realize that maybe its not for clicks or not just for clicks personally i think shes a very lost unhappy girl who is desperately searching for something anything to give her life meaning trans is trendy right now shes had a bit of body dysmorphia hated her boobs once feels like a tomboy sometimesso she puts those scraps together and turns it into im trans again shes just lost  she also is totally clueless obviously talking about im trans but i identify with my birth gender  she doesnt even know what shes talking about but yeah can we go easy on her a little shes just lost and desperate and grabbing for anything thatll be the one big answer to her life,3,NOT
are we just gonna forget about the time she came out as a chicken nugget anyone,2,NOT
i was hoping you would do a video talking about this made me so happy to see it in my subscription box,1,NOT
how can you be transgender and still fully love your birth sex,2,NOT
i think what were witnessing is a person slowly slipping into insanity,5,ABU
this is vodka by the way lmao,1,NOT
i felt this video coming ,1,NOT
thankkk you for touching on her saying she feels black  over her dumbass lol ,5,ABU
never bought merch before but i find myself sitting here awake at am still not having slept yet binge watching your videos  and now i wanna cop some merch,1,NOT
all the petty shade you threw at the start of this vid the location the food the wardrobe choiceloooooove  this is vodka btw you slay girl,2,NOT
you so crazy  love your witty comebacks and goofiness love you,1,NOT
maybe the actual issue should be that those low paying jobs should not be so low paying sadly they actual contribute a similar amount to society as any of the high paying jobs,2,NOT
sooooooooo the wage gap myth is proof that girls are worse at math,5,ABU
wait so they said taking into account choice the gap is only  cents so does mean there still is a gap then just smaller,1,NOT
i think the root of the problem is not the pay gap but the pressures and norms of women to be in the types of jobs that pay less and men in the types of jobs that pay more so there is an inequality but the root problem is in how we raise kids and even subconsciously push them towards different careers society shouldnt discourage men and women from jobs just because its not normal for their gender,1,NOT
anyone has credible sources about it not denying it on the contrary,1,NOT
i like how feminist portray the freedom of choice but do not actually look into the meaning of choice why focus on something that hasnt been researched properly and bark with claims plus men have a psychological burden of having a job however women do not have that burden,5,ABU
graet videothanks prager universityfacts by crhistinemake us to wake up and share with others,2,NOT
it is good that a lovely lady is telling this so angry feminists dont get triggered cuz if it was a man well,3,NOT
all of the feminists saying that there is a gender wage gap then proceeding to tell you that gender is a social construct,3,NOT
f a c t,2,NOT
gentlemanstock in prager university is going up and up and up,2,NOT
why dont business only hire women yes thats exactly what feminism want hire only woman because that person is a woman,3,NOT
oh i thought this was an ad before the actual video,2,NOT
the fact that this was said by a women shows how fake the wage cap is lol,2,NOT
so women really want us to take away their choices fine by me,2,NOT
literally just look at the equal pay act,1,NOT
i agree there is no wage gap however this also ignores that while yes women lean to lower paying jobs for a women in a male dominated field it can be very discouraging and uncomfterable turning many women from picking that feild there is no wage gap but women are discouraged from many high paying desgrees not intentionally but rather just because a girl in a sausage fest is bound to feel uncomfortable,2,NOT
i find it sexist how my career in gender studies doesnt pay me enough as someone who is a doctor,2,NOT
 feminists dislikes this video,2,NOT
what a load of crap more praeger propaganda the data comes from the department of labor,5,ABU
took notes so i can debunk my political class teacher on this,1,NOT
feminism vs feminazi feminazi sexism feminism logic feminazi triggered,2,NOT
i hope i never meet the k people that disliked this,2,NOT
chances of it ever being  between the two genders is unlikely there always will be a wage gap it might be in favour of men and it may also be in favour of women the wage gap is a good thing as it shows that men and women make different choices based on their gender derived strengths and not because they make up the perfect ratio to appease idiots looking for  gap,3,NOT
feminists needs to start closing the huge wage gap between male and female models sex workers and porn stars the gap can range form  to  in favor of the women  come on feminists get your feminism is for both men and women on this,2,NOT
if only countries governments and institutions could address their social problems in this manner they might end up at least moving in the right direction discussing problems like this might not guarantee an ideal solution but it certainly paves way for improvement and helps reducing redundancies,1,NOT
i dont know how people can dislike this video but i guess i shouldnt be surprised when the left cant understand facts,3,NOT
k people understand that the title of this video is a blatant lie if you actually watch the video,2,NOT
these are facts im willing to stand with research has backed the claims given in the video plus a bit of common sense thrown in to boot if the wage gap is  cents why dont employers hire only women,2,NOT
i was thinking the same thing like why cant an experiment be done where men and women work the exact same job and hours do the exact same things in the workrelated area for a month or so then compare wages without the employer being aware of the experiment and then see it they got the same amount of money or not if there is a difference between their wages then something is up otherwise the wage gap isnt a sexist thing,2,NOT
now you notice not many hate comments on this video because they know its right,2,NOT
there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap that could be solved through just working more hours,2,NOT
what is also funny is that paying women less is illegal so it wouldnt even be possible like some feminists suggest,3,NOT
you never take into account what directs the choice of the people women are not sent signals that they can be engineers explorers or have an open world of careers for them i am not trying to sound like some liberal hippy but the it is evident that exposure to certain elements will influence your thought process from a young age women are given easybake ovens and fashion barbies while men are given tool sets and cars while yes you are the one who chooses your career but you are not in control of what products are placed in front of you your whole like that direct you towards who you become therefore there is still oppression with these gender roles also i am sure there is a misconception about females making  to every  and this video does a good job on clearing up some of the math unfortunately i dont know that much about that topic so i wont put in my  cents on where i stand on it maybe that joke was a bit tasteless,3,NOT
woman and men have different values,3,NOT
nice and eyeopening thanks im also years late but apparently thats how youtube recommendations work on the other hand even if  of the worse paying majors were male i still would like to see teachers early childhood educators included psychologist and social workers earn more there is no sexism in this wish either just the thing that these people do a lot to individuals and in my opinion should be valued more this claim that women chooose to study things that lead to lower wages sounded a bit like blaming women for earning averagely somewhat less but then who would do these jobs also if some men didnt do the dangerous jobs who would trust me there are men who would never work on an oil rig and there are women who would never even touch an elderly gentleman or lady or care for them professionally if they cant do this on their own i forgot the word for the home where they live then no i do not compare these jobs and you should neither do that because they are enterily different and not comparable i would like to add the situation in my country beginner teachers earn circa  usd per month without the taxes nurses or social workers who work with the elderly or homeless for example earn even less i now simply dont trust my owm calculations because it seems so few like  dollarshour compared to american wages yes things are a bit cheaper there and we have free universities but my point is that these people do not earn enough money regardless of their gender edit for correction of sentencestructures i struggle with english,2,NOT
some of the proclaimed paygab is said to be because the mommy penalty a woman that choose to get a kid will drop in income because of that but here is the thing you women dont need to get kids right no one is forcing you and you can live the life as a man if you please men can not get children by themself so i would say that men are worse off  in  men will never reproduce in their life but its only  in  for women,3,NOT
praise this woman,1,NOT
good job as always christina,1,NOT
hears feminist automatically dislikes,2,NOT
ive known for years the gender pay gap was made up and was disappointed when obama talked it up but u say in the video the aauw took into account choice found a wage gap and then still go on to say its about choice i believe the main point but treat us like adults and get into the  cent wage gaps nuts and bolts also this woman is a race traitor,5,ABU
as an egalitarian i highly appreciate this video because it gives me a clearer understanding of this whole wage gap situation im constantly told that its real and that its not real so this justifies my confusion,2,NOT
because you cant have a good old boy network with outold boys keep up the work of republican facist propaganda you obviously have never had a job or your a business owner  yes your gender is a problem  why isnt a man doing this report this college must be sponsored by nazis,5,ABU
im sorry but youre legitimately wrong i know multiple woman including my mother who work longer hours than the people in the same company but thats lower on the totem poll and make significantly less as in thousands of dollars per year less nice try but youre not fooling anyone that isnt already brain dead,3,NOT
the only thing i wanna see is higher pay towards education that would be a cool thing to see,1,NOT
also the fact that women give birth and want to raise their family means they have to sacrifice a high end job or full time hours in order to be with her family and raise them they can work part time maximum if they want to actually have time for their family life is all about making sacrifices if you are working in a high end job you often sacrifice your family time and free time if you are working a small part time job you are sacrificing your income in order to have more free time and family time women generally prefer doing the latter women who have children who are working full time or in high end jobs are constantly giving their children to nannies to look after they dont have proper time to spend with their own children and raise them its unfair on the children,2,NOT
simple truth men in same jobs do not make same pay either this is fact this is called negotiation men do not force their employers to pay equal to compensate for their varying negotiating ability save for strikes and union representation if women want true equality they just have to learn to negotiate better without coercion of the law or using their feminine character in any way learn to play the game they so desperately wish to a be a part of in a truly fair way,3,NOT
basically when you put in all the factors there is an actual gender wage gap but its not as big as the general number that some people use equality is a long continuous battle that has gone on through history and will continue until everyone is totally and completely equal there will always be assholes and sexist out there same for racist but if we can change ourselves we can work to make that number smaller we do not live in a post feminist world just because we have the right to vote does not mean we have equality i think that should be noted and understood that its the general mindset that we need to change,2,NOT
common sense sign i cant believe that we cant even use this word easily damn postmodernism,3,NOT
preach it sister,1,NOT
this video has a point but it doesnt tell the whole story often traditionally female fields are paid less because they are mostly women also women are less likely to ask for a pay raise partially bc they are more likely to be looked on as pushy or aggressive than a man would be it is often harder for women to get to higher level positions that pay more because they arent viewed as as good leaders and male bosses and even as a few studies have shown other women may discriminate against women when giving promotions many high paying male dominated fields also have problems with sexual harassment silicon valley is a good example which obviously discourages female workers the problem is not companies deliberately paying women less it is that it is harder for women to get into higher paying fields,2,NOT
i cant believe this wage gap myth is still going on,3,NOT
you already admitted that when you control for all the factors you listed there is still a wage gap you just proved that the wage gap exists and that its not explainable in economic terms you also left out institutional barriers to working in higher paid positions the argument that businesses would higher more women if the wage gap existed ignore that if women are viewed as being less valuable then they will be paid less,2,NOT
this is so stupid no wonder its from the same website that denies humans are causing climate change,3,NOT
wasnt this lady one of the guest that spoke with milo and crowder if so she is honestly what all feminist should aspire to be like,2,NOT
men are more likely to pick high paying jobs and women are more likely to pick low paying jobs within the statistics provided in the video from that you could say that the higher paying jobs are more masculine and less feminine because of the choices females and males are more likely to make on average representing the different mind sets than the lower paying jobs and that our society tends to benefit masculine qualities over feminine qualities as a whole determined from those statistics also the title there is no gender wage gap is very misleading when the video proceeds to explain why there is a gender wage gap this argument comes across as very counterintuitive one last thing genders occurred in our species long before we formed a currency in which to reward each other for jobs doesnt it seem strange we have worked ourselves into a situation as a species in which occupations that are mostly male dominated are going to get rewarded more than female dominated occupations over the duration of time we have been evolving with these delicate and influential minds problems like these have inevitably been emphasised and expanded from our initial nature and we should probably fix it,2,NOT
i destroyed  feminists and my teacher in our econ class thank you,5,ABU
give this woman a medal already,2,NOT
atleesr shes not a feminist,5,ABU
is gender studies not one of the worst paying majors,2,NOT
if the narrator of this video was a dude this video would have been s h o t b e h i n d a b a r n,3,NOT
the only way to make this video better is to have president trump narrate it feminist would be pulling their blue hair out with both hands,3,NOT
god bless you,2,NOT
i must show this to my teacher,1,NOT
the first sentence destroyed the entire wage gap myth,2,NOT
who else believe that girls should be paid more because they are girls becauseiamagirl or pay equal for doing work from  of all the times to not working at all because again they are girls becauseiamagirl and have priorities to allocate all their time finding harem of guys to satisfy all their needs,5,ABU
hmm its blantantly ignorant to say that there is no pay gap i mean its clear that the average woman does make less than the average man but its not anyones fault but the women who are making the choices that are holding them back from economic success theres many variables and traits that exist within this  cents to the dollar thing the largest ones but not the only ones being mother hood the fact that women choose lower paying jobs and competitiveness so while i agree with the statistics that feminists just need to stop bitching because nothing can be done to put more money in their wallets because its already illegal to pay people more or less based on discriminations such as race or sex but the message that the gap isnt real is just going against facts theyre not really anyones fault but they are facts women make less than men fact of life quit having children and work more maybe youll make the same amount,5,ABU
based mom we are grateful for your excellent common sense,2,NOT
yes there is a wage gap dont market that,2,NOT
no wage gap i think its about your positions at the job so we need to stop comparing lel,3,NOT
there is a simple answer to her comment generally people who choose to remove themselves from the workforce earn less than those who do not,3,NOT
can you send me the information sources of this i wont belive what you say just because you say it,3,NOT
the one prageru video i like,2,NOT
earning less and being paid less are two totally different things,1,NOT
i think that woman got less and still in many places get less wages cause there is a certain mindset that women dont have as much as the caliber as a man also woman come with a load of baggage as in child care which is alone too much for a business to handle that is why women are not chosen for jobs everytime it is practical for men to be chosen for businesses but this neglects woman who want to work the system is filled with holes maybe the problem is not present in your region but nothing in the world is regional we can find many cases of wage gap in many places i dont believe im a toxic feminist or anything so if you want to argue let us do it politely,1,NOT
can you give links of your sources please,1,NOT
nobody on the left claims women are paid less than men for the same job except in third world countries and rare instances where equal pay legislation doesnt apply so congratulations on the strawman,3,NOT
im pretty sure the left is against common sense too,5,ABU
k feminists disliked,3,NOT
small problem with the animation at  it shows the wage ratio shrink from  centsdollar to  centsdollar which means that the wage gap is even more extreme that we previously thought,2,NOT
glad to see this is spoken by a woman so that there is no excuses for the feminists ,2,NOT
this woman is now my hero,1,NOT

in my feminist country tge wage gap is reveseman paid less for the same joband this one is true the survey was very well constructed idk how it is in dollars but a women get  when guys get  this is unfair and there is no man movement herecause we dont care we want the best for our females unlike the feminists that wants the worst for manwe dont have any kind of feminism and everybody like happily here,5,ABU
one of the only good prager u videos ive actually ever seen well done,2,NOT
its sad that there are dislikes on the video and its not cause someone tries to be an edgy troll really sad people who are disliking it ,2,NOT
after seeing some comments regarding the maternity leave i have something to say if you care enough to read things changed so much in the last  years many developed countries have not only maternity leave but paternity leave as well so usually the woman is the first who takes that leave to recover from laboroperation and to breastfeed if they have milk but more and more women choose not to breastfeed or they simply dont have milk childrens health doesnt suffer much from this factor actually then its the dad who takes a leave and women usually leave enough milk at home so that dad could take care of the child there is no reason why he cant if you think about it for example in finland you see as many dads as moms walking in the park with their newborns for that reason so there is no reason for that gap you people are referring to btw statistics tells us that in the past couple of decades more and more dads take a sick leave to take care of a sick child in europe its not only on women anymore spouses are finally a team with equally shared responsibilities after all very few families might afford for one of the parents to stay home to take care of childrenhome because of todays economics so this gap even if it exists should disappear completely in the near future there is no guarantee for a business if they hire a man he isnt the one who will take care of children when they get sick and not to hire a childless woman only because in the future she might have children is not practical at all after all men are physically stronger but womens health and endurance is better and they live longer in almost all of the countries easy statistics to look up they fall sick rarer and take more care of their health and if they are valuable to the business there is no reason not to hire them if they are more suitable to the position and there is absolutely no justified motivation to pay them less even if they take one or two maternity leaves during their career men will take as many months to take care of their health when they fall sick or their children will and it is beautiful if you ask me children have both parents equally present there is no better thing for them i hope these facts are enough for you to realize why there is completely no base at the decision why to pay women less for the same work there is no way for companies to predict the future of the employee no matter the gender,1,NOT
notice how the lowest paying vocations are all caring professions  which are all stereotypically womens work if there was no gender pay gap the lowest paid jobs would be brought in line with the highest paying jobs but unfortunately womens work is not valued and therefore not paid well men have more freedom in their choices to relocate and work long hours because it is traditionally the woman who takes care of the other responsibilities so that he may provide for the family unless of course he has none of those extra family related responsibilities caring for ageing parents children cooking cleaning other stereotypical womens work this video literally goes on to say that people without responsibilities who can be at the business beck and call will be favoured because it suits the business and who in society has the least responsibility to caring men traditionally theyre job is to provide and protect which in this era translates to bring in the money this video is a contradiction of itself,2,NOT
finally a women who speaks the truth and doesnt just try to attack men and doesnt just try to take over the world,3,NOT
facts thank you for this  feminism needs to be removed from humanity,5,ABU
this is the one and only thing prager u has ever gotten right in terms of being factual i will give them credit for this thing they have not been either lying through their teeth about or misrepresenting facts to support good on you for actually having a legitimate argument for once ever but i immediately retract my praises when i realize the only reason they dont lie about this subject is because it fits their narrative and position without need for modification therefore there is no need to go through intense mental gymnastics to make the position fit their views like almost every other single goddamned subject they bring up but here is a newsflash people on the left already know this fact the only ones who still believe in it are new wave feminists and overly extreme leftists you are late to the party trying to debunk a situation that has already been apparent for quite some time now to anyone who isnt insane or stupid,2,NOT
i have never believed in any form of equality its never happened in human history no study takes into account the individual choices that make up a persons working day no person does exactly as another person in their jobso no equality its like human rightsnice to say and lamentunless you are one of the millions who have their human rights ripped away by force,3,NOT
what a slap to feminists by being told this by a women,3,NOT
if they have the same job they should be paid equally simple as that,1,NOT
there is a gender wage gap but there is no gender earnings gap everyone gets the same for the same work youve mixed up your terms,2,NOT

so you are pointing out how our culture teaches women that they cant or shouldnt be in technical majors and careers or leadership roles this is what leads to a lower median salary for women so we should work harder to let women know that are just as capable of engineering and technical work instead of pushing them out of these historically male dominated fields,2,NOT
a few minutes worth of research proves that this video essay is inaccurate,2,NOT
yes someone who tells the truth on this matter the differences are due to mindset and decisions which are influenced greatly by society it is society that causes the wage gap,2,NOT
hahaha is this a joke does anyone genuinely believe it doesnt exist,2,NOT
they have literally zero links to sources which for a site that considers themselves a university is very suspect since a student handing in a paper w no way to reach sources would fail i wanted to see the articles myself but it seems as if the channel wants to hide these studies if someone could find these studies i may believe the video but since i havent seen any links i cant trust this video,1,NOT
great video glad you made this video so this wage gap some feminists are complaining about is finally debunked,3,NOT
can you send me some feminists tears that you got with your video,3,NOT

the sad thing is that the only people watching this video are the ones who already believed it,2,NOT
it is illegal for a company to pay someone less for the same position based on gender or race it is legal to pay them differently based on experience education and performance,2,NOT
there is im highly conservative and i can confirm there is occasionally a significant wage gap a male coworker at my mothers work who she is friends with talked about salary to see if there was a difference since they have the exact same qualifications and do the same job the male coworker makes about k more a year that is not okay,1,NOT
i thought this was obvious already,2,NOT
common sense is not common,3,NOT
dammit i just finished my essay on why the wage gap is false then i get this,2,NOT
why dont companies hire only women then the same reason they get paid more in the first place,2,NOT
even when you do take into account all the variables like occupation hours worked etc theres still an unexplained wage gap of  depending on whos doing the math,2,NOT
i guess the gap can be explained by pregnancy and by all those jobs where strength is useful so the guys have a big advantage,2,NOT
not bad not bad at all good video,1,NOT
at my job most of the females leave work an hour early a few days out of the week there is only  guy that likes to leave early he hates the job those same women complain they dont make as much as the guys  we stay behind sometimes we are all paid the exact same,1,NOT
what balls women who do jobs of the same skill level do get paid less in a lot of areas glasgow city council a due to pay its deal workers millions in back pay because it was doing this very thing,2,NOT
the worst part about these comments are that teachers are are teaching this false belief that the wage gap exists at my old job i was the only female who would work doubles and be there when no one wanted to when it came time i got the raises and then became a manager hard work pays off,2,NOT
omg finally someone not speaking just some shit joining the mainstream thank you so much for this video,3,NOT
why am i having to resubscribe freakin liberals,3,NOT
this is what i like to see the truth those dislikes are from people in denial who do buzzfeed quizzes instead of listening during their uni lectures,2,NOT
but why do women make different choices also dont diss people just cuz you think theyre wrong like you did at the end of the video,3,NOT
ive never really believed that women get paid less for the same work i believe that women have a harder time getting on the top and do more jobs that make less money this video seems to prove my theory right,2,NOT
i was at walmart today saw some razors they were  cents for a pack with  blades look at the same brand and thing at the womens razors  blades  dollars and  cents,2,NOT
christina hoff sommers ,1,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense gold,2,NOT
i think the only right way to look at the gender wage gap is to look if men and femals get the same wage for the same job with the same hours all other calculations follow a prefixed idia,2,NOT
its not a question of whether or not there should be a wage gap its a question of what that wage gap should naturally be given all the advantages that women are given the wage gap should probably be wider if we keep social engineering the disharmony between men and women will continue,3,NOT
most prageru vids are about politics usually things i dont or at least rarely agree with but when its not about politics i love these videos,2,NOT
 truth hating feminists disliked this,5,ABU
there isnt a gender wage gap there is a flaw in the age wage system though someone whos  will receive less per hour because of their age and everyone  are entitled to more how so some  year olds have houses kids etc and some people over  dont some younger people may put more effort in and dont doze about like some over s do but because of their age theyre paid less or more so much mucking about how about paying more based on experience effort and responsibility rather than their age then theres noncewood and indoctrination centres known as schools and most braindead politicians the ones that dont live in the real world just have beans and crisps and shut up you hypocritical virtue signalling nonces greed thats all it comes down to today and why we have such a dysfunctional system that affects many people especially younger,2,NOT
these choices and behaviors are being influenced by social expectations so there may not be an actual paying wage gap but there are still gender roles that hinder people from reaching their full potential,3,NOT
i saw this as a ad and it was so great i watched the full  min ad,2,NOT
well this just flipped my view,2,NOT
what are feminist fighting forwhat is real that feminist are fighting for,3,NOT
this video cant be real it doesnt go along with all the dummies lmao,3,NOT
but what about the fact that men are more often considered for promotions that identical resumes with the only difference being gender result in the female being offered lower pay or flat out rejected why is it that the national womens soccer team pulled in more views on their world cup victory but was paid a fraction of the mens team who didnt even come close obviously theirs a lot of factors that come into all these calculations and a lot of good points are raised in this video such as the dangerous work conditions but i think with the information accessible it is still hard to discern where the issue lies women are more likely to be stay at home parents whereas boys are often more encouraged to pursue these high paying careers likewise that men are more willing to work longer hours and are very possibly more qualified i believe that their might still be a gender wage gap at play but its a lot more complex than a lot of people put it out to be in my opinion more research and information should be gathered in order to finally put this question to rest,2,NOT
i would share this but i would get flamed by the women on my socials kinda sad,3,NOT
men and women should be equal you cant hit me im a girl what youre a man no your opinion doesnt matter on mens issues feminists lmao,3,NOT
its very effective to speak about this issue as a female,2,NOT
they probably had to have a woman say this because no feminist would listen to or believe a man if he said the same thing,3,NOT
i like the whole argument but he best part is that a women proves this to be true though thank you for making these statements,3,NOT
like all immoral stuff the media pushes nothing,2,NOT
after watching this video im completely upset with my school they are teaching us that the  cent wage gap is real i thought school was supposed to give u facts not a myth,2,NOT
the earnings gap calculation suffers from survivor bias  men are more willing to take on responsibility and more demanding roles some of them do well from this and others end up out of their depth and get fired the ones who get fired arent included in the average any more but the ones who do well are included this artificially skews the average towards men heres the math lets say we start with  men and  women each on k per year the average salary is k a year for both men and women then  men and  women move to k roles  women do well  get fired  men do well  get fired presuming same success rate between men and women total number of women remaining in the sample   total womens salary   k   plus   k   million average womans salary   total number of men remaining in the sample   total mens salary   k plus   k   million average mans salary   so the average mans salary ends up  higher just from this one factor  survivor bias,2,NOT
well the calculations are indeed wrong but there is a wage gap this video just takes a wrong calculation and uses it to say yeah everything is fake but the real wage gap not that one which is commonly used by a lot of public media and politicians is determined by looking at men and women who acutally do the same thing in the same company at the same office and even if most of you dont want to accept it there is a difference it is absolutly true if a men and a women go to a job interview for exactly the same position and talking to exactly the same boss there is a high chance that they get different wage offers this ist statistically proven,1,NOT
i want to see all those feminist faces who are spreading lies in the name of equalitythey must be burning,3,NOT
beat that feminists,5,ABU
another reason is because its illegal to pay women less or more,2,NOT
feminists self combusting out of sheer ignorance,5,ABU
tbh i still dont understand lol,1,NOT
so women choose to earn less than men,2,NOT
ill take you to the candy shop,2,NOT
the first sentence just got me straight lol,2,NOT
women choosing career that requires nurturing  compassion is  okay its their choice feminazis should never demonize them just because they chose what they love to do although i will argue that most of these hard working women deserves more i mean example teachers family councilors nurses these women are the people who shape our children who in turn will shape our future they help us a lot to make the families which is the core of our society intact their impact in our society is not as obvious but they do play a big  important role in developing it so yes they deserve more maybe not in the same way as doctors or engineers or lawyers because these professions require a lot more technical skills but they do deserve a better standard of living in our society,2,NOT
there is no gender wage gap  when controlling for all factors the wage gap is around  theyre not even trying lol,2,NOT
excellent video and a great explanation of the simpson paradox,3,NOT
i love this woman,1,NOT
even if the gender wage gap was true which it isnt it would still be fair women spend at least  of their work time gossiping instead of working they spend work time to keep up on each others relationships discuss who said or did what to whom and talking about nonwork related issues they also dont to any heavy lifting or strenuous work they have the men do that for them  of what a man makes would be fair because they dont even do  of the work,5,ABU
in austria there are jobs where women earn  less than men its the same job the same theres nothing different theyre just paid less for the same work,2,NOT
show this to all the dumb celebrities at the award shows lol,3,NOT
spectacular now off to paruse the comments section and laugh at offended feminists,5,ABU
i have studied this subject this is by far the best most concise video explanation thanks prager,2,NOT
huh actually good content only thing i would have added is that the  most likely does contain some meaningful amount of sexism in it instead of saying other variables would narrowit to the point of vanishing,3,NOT
there actually is its not as wide as some claim but recent research shows its about  cents for men and women in the exact same occupation with the same productivity etc,2,NOT
you know  i think its not  there is a gender wage gap or there is no gender wage gap  its something in between only looking at the average income is of course pretty dumb it does not account for so much  for instance more women staying at home however just brushing the whole thing off is not fair there have been actual studies that compare women and men with equal jobs qualifications and work time it showed that women actually earm  ct per dollar a man earns im no die hard sjw communist or whatever but brushing somethinf off from both sides as not existent or overexagerate is not too smart if youre interested in this go watch david pakmans video on gender pay gap,2,NOT
literally the best video ive ever watched,2,NOT
if i had a dollar for everytime i need to show this video to somebody,1,NOT
elizabeth warren pays her female staff on average a median income of  percent of her male staff now she has five men who are in high level positions and this skews the numbers she has a lot of lowerlevel female staffers who make less and this skews the numbers elizabeth warren does not pay women less money for doing the same job she is not a sexist who pays women less for doing the same job rather her staff gender gap reflects differences in jobs however when she looks at the economy she believes women are making less money for doing the same jobs as men this is why nobody should ever be taken seriously who says equal pay for equal work as if this is what the numbers mean,2,NOT
thanks christina your right p,1,NOT
the beginning already destroyed like  of feminists,3,NOT
i love this ladys voice ,1,NOT
why is it necessary to explain the obvious its sad that people are so ignorant not to figure it alone,2,NOT
im glad a woman is explaining this,2,NOT
good video males wallet makers and sellers get paid significantly less than womens purses address that pay gap if its wrong based on interest they so is comparing sportsman and sportswomen male jewellery makers and sellers are paid significantly less than female jewellery makers and sellers so its evolutionary biology grow up and accept it,3,NOT
they chose this the amount of stupid in this video makes me sad,2,NOT
i swear that watching this entire praegeru series on youtube has given me a superior and more practical education than  years of college did factor in the subtle indoctrination i no doubt received obtaining a liberal arts degree and all i needed to unlearn in the real world id say these little videos are invaluable,2,NOT
now we have to debunk the wage gap for the other  genders,3,NOT
in communism everyone shares a common wealth,1,NOT
so simpsons paradox,2,NOT
equal pay act of  pushed forward in congress by republicans filibustered by democrats signed into law by president kennedy according to federal law it is illegal to pay someone less for the same amount of work based solely on their gender women arent being paid less theyre choosing to make less,3,NOT
this channel is literally just reverse buzzfeed,2,NOT
could you guys post your sources for your evidence for videos that would be very helpful,1,NOT
you tell that to my mom please cause she knows for a fact that men in the same position that she is in earn more,2,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense best sentence in the entire video lmao,2,NOT
convoluted logic untested then becomes fantasy and distortion you state that there is no gender wage gap and then state that the gap is small then you justify the wage gap we can argue about how small and justifiable the gap is but first we need to know how you can state something that just isnt true in the first place this is just the old evangelical trick of providing lie to people who dont want to be called liars,2,NOT
still the questions remains why do women make those different choices a lot of those choices in college major number of hours worked etc are influenced by the fact that women are still expected to be homemakers even if both parents work fulltime countless studies show that when a mother and father both work mom does the majority of the housework and childrearing this could partly be due to biology where women are more inclined to nurture their children giving you the benefit of the doubt but it is undoubtedly largely thanks to societal pressure and cultural norms,2,NOT
though you make a valid point most of the studies done about wage gaps refer to women doing the same job as men and i mean exact same job for the same company so ya know its not just medians and averages though that was alot of the reason the wage gap got so poulour,2,NOT
to all the feminists who hate the usa why do you live in it,5,ABU

i wonder where the feminazis went,5,ABU
men do not have a uterus  that is where the  cents comes from,3,NOT
my whole geography class is being brain washed into thinking the wage gap is true it scares me,2,NOT
this is all correct but take in factors such as social pressures it is more expected for a women to give up work temporarily or permanently in order to take care of their children which is unfair on both women and men also a company is more likely to promote a man over a women especially if she is of the age where most women have children because maternity leave is expensive for companies to deal with again i believe that this is unfair i think that a way to reduce the gender pay gap is to increase the length of paternity leave to the length of maternity leave not only to eradicate the inequality but also so that a man can have the necessary time with his child,1,NOT
this channel is like the opposite of buzzfeed,2,NOT
i can hear the feminists screaming   ,3,NOT
its always good when a woman debunks this crap cuz its more likely to be heeded,3,NOT
the video there is no wage gap also the video even when we use sleezy techniques to eliminate the wage gap we still find a  difference,2,NOT
even with this video theyll find something to nag about the so call pay gap myth ,3,NOT
its pretty ridiculous how hard it is to find this video on yt even if you search the exact title of the video,1,NOT
who ever dislikes this video has  iq,3,NOT
i always knew this when i found out some people thought women earn less than men in america because of discrimination i was very surprised they actually think so,2,NOT
if these videos cant end feminism i dont know what can,3,NOT
there is a wage gap its the reasoning behind it which is the issue this video shows that the reason there is a wage gap is justified,2,NOT
nothing new learned here as it all common sense can someone forward this on to barack obummer as he did not have the two brain cells required to rub together to fathom this problem out for himself feminists do not want to know the truth as they enjoy being the victim so they can bitch and whine,5,ABU
how is the argument of the wage gap even still a thing i mean wasnt this proven to be a myth years ago,3,NOT
for once i can say prageru is right,2,NOT
doesnt matter if this video is true or not im downvoting because its patronizing af,2,NOT
the only legitimate sexism that i see towards women is that more often than not mothers are expected to sacrifice much more time for their child even if they make simpler amounts of or more money than their husband its not always the case but it happens a lot,2,NOT
this is video is wrong,1,NOT
its because the top pay comes from hardest physical work,1,NOT
to the six thousand people who diliked this video would any of you like refute any of what was said,1,NOT
those that claim for the same work women earn  cents on the dollar compared to men on the other hand are not only bad at math but at telling the truth applause,2,NOT
everything christina said was true unfortunately she did not address the issue that many have with the gender wage gap the choices themselves why dont women pursue stem careers as much as men telling girls that they are discriminated against is definitely counterproductive but actively encouraging them to pursue these types of interests is necessary since they are unlikely to have female role models in these fields no women dont want to get paid the same to do social work as a petroleum engineer they want to be given every opportunity to become a petroleum engineer that a man has please check your privilege before discounting this statement,2,NOT
individual choice thats where the sexism lies do you really think having women in the least paid college majors is an explanation and not a problem in itself  it reveals how sexism it impregnated in society because of differentiated socialization girls will be directed to least rewarding sectors literature classes for example in france instead of scientific section which is overcrowded by boys and have a very lower selfesteem than boys read sociology,2,NOT
there are many feminist and alt leftist who dont believe in factslittle do they know facts dont care about your feelings ben shapiro,3,NOT
woo petroleum engineering is a top  paid job,1,NOT
men likes to work longer than women i have to disagree while making overtime while my male comrades are already gone even their shift didnt ended its just bullcrap that most women arent willing to work longer as much as men are willing to do overtime when someone mentions overtime its always the males who complains at first and that they need higher loan for working more while we women just accept that the situation requires it and just do it and often even ask for it although theres actually no reason for it at least thats how it was in the last  companies ive worked it got multiple times fired because i was too expensive bc of my will to work more funny i know,2,NOT
because man have a responsibility to take care of his big family honestly i dont care about this wage gap as long as i get paid i understand because i have a father who goes to work at early morning and be home at late night just for his precious family  barely at home father mom is also having a hard time in the house by taking care of her  children,1,NOT
anyone who has taken a few statistics course knows that comparing avarges on itself makes little sense you also need to calculate with the different characteristics of each group you want to compare,1,NOT

excuse me logic doesnt work on feminists you simply need to screech louder than they do,5,ABU
whats the wage gap between the  genders,3,NOT
this video doesnt address hiring  promotion policies or the fact that two people doing the same job may be paid differently usually the woman earning less some women are completely willing to work long hours and yet they still get paid less also according to the acfe women are less likely to commit fraud so maybe companies should consider hiring more women into higher level positions,1,NOT
my mom is one of the few women i know who chose to major in computer science and she ears  a year nowagegap,2,NOT
the people that say that prageru is a propaganda site are total idiots,3,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,2,NOT
additional differences for women more time off for individual illness and family illness breaks for childbirth often impacts seniority and reduces implied qualifications for higher positions where absence could impact the business applies for jobs with lower travel lower danger better chances of getting home to pick up baby cook clean,1,NOT

but the portuguese government just wasted almost  million euros to end gender inequality in companies hey socialism,2,NOT
ive been an accountant for a long time and seen a lot of payrolls the wage gap is complete hooey ive seen lots of cases where women make more than men in the exact same job,2,NOT
i agree there is no real discrimination but i think that family contributes to this gap women are the primary caretakers of children therefore they take more time off work and men as the breadwinners often have to find a second job to support their families i believe there needs to be done to minimize that gap since too many men are experiencing too much stress and too many women are earning less which means also less savings and a smaller pension for them in the future,2,NOT
haha k feminists didnt seem to like this video,3,NOT
the best part is that a woman says this,2,NOT
you know what people keep focusing on the different pay for the same job thing but theyre missing a bigger picture men in america im not sure about elsewhere can drop out of high school join a union where they get paid while they train get full benefits and really good wages they can learn these trades from their dad uncle anyone really while they grow up and have a job that pays them really well right at the start of their life my dad knows how to do all kinds of skilled trades but if i tried to ask him what he working on hed say i was in his light and tell me to go play hes teaching my little brother about fixing cars of course and im glad when i graduated i got a job as a housekeeper at days inn i was paid based on the number of rooms i was assigned to clean and given  minutes to clean them after that times up im working for free i made  an hour and worked my ass off but made at most  a week working full time then i got job after job making  at the most womens work doesnt pay well it just doesnt so i thought i wanna make money like the guys do ill work hard im not scared of labor and went to school for welding turns out i loved it looooved it i loved every part of my job in and of itself however i didnt love the harassment and bullying i had to deal with i wasnt walking in with a pink helmet and crying girl power or anything ridiculous i wore  sports bras a jumpsuit and made a point to be polite to everyone i crossed paths with while keeping to myself and staying out of any nonsense it turns out even if i keep to myself and try to not start any drama when youre the only woman in a building with over  men someone some jerk will have a problem with you based solely on the fact they think you shouldnt be there that one jerk will multiply quickly then you find the guys you thought were your friends coming up and telling you i hate whats happening to you its not right youre a hard worker and you do a great job but i just want you to know that ill never defend you youll be gone eventually theyll make sure of it and ill be the next target if i do point is they say well women can do those jobs now too if they want to and while thats true and not every womans experience it was for me im not talking about being flirted with either i can handle that i had a manger from a department that was totally unrelated to mine slamming his breaks in front of me on the highway and trying to drive me into a wall over and over leaving work one day i didnt even know who it was or why it was happening until the next day when i saw him get out of the same car no road rage cutting anyone off riding anyones ass type of thing thats just one example out of many i can give forget about the unequal pay for the same job part wheres the union with paid training for womens work i mean it sounds almost stupid to say out loud but wheres the cleaners union or the secretaries union or whatever job women are supposedly naturally good at the other day i paid a guy  to hook up my internet he was  hours late it took him  minutes i gave him a beer and a taco to go home with he seriously showed up at  pm i cleaned someones house the other day for  the lady had  small children she homeschooled and the house was a disaster i felt bad for her and wound up spending most of my money on suppliesgas and it took  hours to clean it was a waste of time honestly but no one seems to think anything of paying women basically nothing when they hire them but pay an electrician or plumber astronomically more money thats the problem no one questions that when women were originally allowed to work they typically had husbands that made the money and the women just supplemented the income so it wasnt a big deal to pay women less but were still living on that base model today and people arent getting married after high school now im  and single and take care of myself its not like that anymore,2,NOT
glad to see that there are still some sane democrats in the world such as christina,3,NOT
i despise most social workers they only help women and condemn innocent men,5,ABU
people realize that the wage gap isnt representative of two people with the same exact job the problem with the wage gap is that women are stuck into traditionally lower paying jobs based on systematic oppression and irrational gender stereotypes its not communism its a culture still recovering from political social and economic gender inequality,2,NOT
youtube ads now redpilling people is this timeline a hologram,2,NOT
ben shapiro destroy sjw with fact,3,NOT
why are they still pushing this agenda the pay gap has been debunked time and time again yet there is a trending topic about it on google and youtube,2,NOT
i want to show this to my mother and all feminists but theyll just say thats not true or something like that,2,NOT
thank you for trying to find all the facts,2,NOT
so nowwe have proof men are smarter and make more hahaha women have children so thats  the rest is just because women dont do the same job,5,ABU
this is facepalm inducingly obvious i cant believe were still talking about this anyone who is honest with themselves about the biological differences between men and women and their priorities men are ambitious status seeking women are all about relating to others will get it without issue only the biology deniers eg those who think women are as strong as men will continue to push this dumb narrative re wage gap,3,NOT
the myth is still being pushed that she had to do a second video,1,NOT
why dont businesses hire only women because the majority of women takes maternity leave so businesses wouldnt have any employees isnt that obvious,2,NOT
but dont they make as much because stereotypes convince or force them to do less paying jobs,1,NOT
guys why do we get restricted its almost as if we are opposing everything this company is going for,2,NOT
so she blatantly ignores the fact that not all of those were choices maybe some of the woman in lower paying jobs wanted something that paid more but were rejected because they were female maybe sexism lies more in the people with the duty of hiring rather than the people who give out wages,2,NOT
sooo what you are saying is that actually women are stupid and take all the wrong decisions or or wait you are saying that there is a gene in the y chromosome that allows men only to work long hours without notice really is there a study to prove such a thing or you just thought of it and if this is the case after all and lets say that all the gender wage gab is created by choices why women feel compelled to make choices like these is society driving them is it the fact that they are the only humans that can actually reproduce the species or maybe we should change that lets stop reproducing since it all boils down to choices because being the only one capable of giving birth is a choice sure thing and by the way call your mother and inform her that as a woman she is not willing to work long hours without notice i am sure she will have a few things to say about that good day,5,ABU
teachers should be paid more because they might just have one of the most important and difficult jobs in the nation just think about how many kids with behavioral issues they have to help and the decisions they make that impact the future generations,1,NOT
aaaaannnnnnnnnndddddddddddd now i am gonna keep this in a playlist for when wage gap arguments cone up,2,NOT
not to mention most of the incredibly rich people in the us are men celebrities ceos etc all making above k a year drastically impacts the average,1,NOT
let me guess feminists this woman is being held captive by the patriarchy,3,NOT
wtf thats a big difference in pay,2,NOT
this video titled there is no wage gap admitted a quarter through the video that a  cent wage gap exists,2,NOT
maybe the best paying majors are mostly male because women cant get into those fields because of sexism in the job field,2,NOT
i absolutely love this,1,NOT
the equal pay act of  makes it illegal to underpay a gender checkmate feminists,2,NOT
very well done christina you rock xoxo,1,NOT
feminists bitch about being paid less than men okay well maybe if you got a job in any of the fields that men typically work in eg mining construction railroads etc then you would have the same pay rate i dont think that some lady who works at a hotel reception or hair salon should make the same as a man who is up to his elbows in shit to fix a broken pump at a sewage treatment plant,5,ABU
the sadest part of this video is a woman saying this isnt sexism its common sense,2,NOT
i actually took the time to read the georgetown university study and can confirm that the data presented in this video is  accurate to explain the  difference  men are more willing to work overtime  women take more time off maternity leave  women are less likely to ask for a raise  other variables,2,NOT
i just want to shove this video in every feminists face every stupid feminist out there protesting instead of working should have this video plastered on her face and forced to listen to it  times,5,ABU
yeah yeah their personal career choices but what if some women are forced to make these choices women cant avoid having children can they and if women want to take care of their children then theyll probably need to take more time off work than men,2,NOT
is this humour category ,2,NOT
oh my gosh thank you,1,NOT
liked reposted keep up the awesomeness,1,NOT
my family keeps trying to make me think the gap is real i keep telling them this and the only thing they have to defend themselves is no its real,1,NOT
could i get the sources for these studies,1,NOT
wow good one,1,NOT
these are the alternative facts folks seems legit,2,NOT
i am not sure if prager u is conservative or neutral though i am fine either way because i am conservative and i agree there is no wedge gap,2,NOT
this is a great woman,1,NOT
there is no gender wage gap  only in as much as women do half the hours men do but want the same pay,3,NOT
if a woman tells you that they earn less than a man for doing the same job just ask them to give you an exampleand that will be it,3,NOT
and apparently in the s when women did have lower pay than men women eventually took over those jobs,2,NOT
so the problem is getting woman into the fields that they want to work in and give them opportunities to choose specialties work more hours etc til theyre making what they want to be making as long as that is achieved thats what matters,1,NOT
this is such bull shit ,2,NOT
last year during my senior year of highschool we had a test in my economics class one of the questions was what are the reasons for the gender wage gap i wrote that is doesnt exist my teacher failed me,2,NOT
this why i dont join feminized because i dont want to be a villain like those women,5,ABU
k fat sexually frustrated feminists who didnt get their morning donuts watched this video,2,NOT
this is so true,1,NOT
ugh yes we know this already its the reason why this happens we are trying to solve i think that it has to do with the facts that what is considered normaltypical jobs for men and women and what is considered normal comes from the old gender strereotypes that lead us its easier to be normal ill give an example im a woman whos always been interested on woodworks in elementary school i had to decide if i go to sewing classes or woodworking i wanted to go to woodworking but since i was really shy and all my friends went to sewing classes i followed them things like these leads to less experience and makes chances to get to your chosen schooljobs etc worse well thankfully things arent that bad in my country and i did get into a carpenter school now getting a job is a different story d,2,NOT
can we raise awareness of this channel,2,NOT
coming from a women im way happier why cant society understand as a  year old i totally understand why women protest and stuff like that but i know for sure they dont know how to fix it,1,NOT
this ignores so many things both sides ignore many things just one example man work more paid hours women work more unpaid hours they have to work at home and take care of the children that is an inequality,2,NOT
but surely we should be asking the question of why women are making these worse career choices and why women are worse educated,3,NOT
the gender wage gap has been debunked so many times its sad that people have to keep coming out and saying this over and over again while the landwhale feminaizis just plug their ears and yell patriarchy,5,ABU
feminists will watch this video but still goes like we are paid less this is sexist why cant we be paid more,3,NOT
the truth is a microaggression,2,NOT
they should have way more subs,2,NOT
this myth will never die people who want to believe that their failures are due to a worldwide conspiracy will always gravitate towards myths like this,2,NOT
male strippers make a lot less money than female strippers and female models make way more money than female models u dont hear men crying oppression and sexism,3,NOT
the thing i wanted to hear during this claim that its not sexist but didnt was why are the choices women make prefer paid significantly less than the choices men make prefer if someone answers that the fields men choose are more significant or important im going to throw something it appears that either society could care less about the caring for humanity fields or about paying higher wage for women dominated fields this is crucial but wasnt studied so the study is spurious,2,NOT
businesses hire men and give them more because they actually work morecausing them to have a higher pay,1,NOT
i cant believe progressives are out and about denying literal facts and yes they are facts check out my most recent video for more info,3,NOT
why would people dislike this feminist wow i hate this video because it shows women are the same as men,2,NOT
the problem of men earning more than women can be solved easily and economically all are paid equal for the same work and although all are paid according to the womens tariff point of view women do not earn less but men get too much  problem solved has anyone actually noticed that feminists like men want to be treated and behave like men they do not want to be feminine  at the same time they criticize the behavior of the men  total sickness ,5,ABU
one more comment female dominated jobs seem to reflect females natural abilities as a result of having babies unfortunately when a couple ie a male and a female decides to have children it is usually the females job that is sacrificed why because the males job pays more was it the females choice alone to have children so why does it always seem the female takes the hit careerwise,2,NOT
you cant explain numbers to snowflakes and jigglypuffs they only care about emotions even if does emotions are more toxic than what they call toxic masculinity,5,ABU
now you may wonder why jobs that are historicaly woman jobs have lower pay,3,NOT
i truly agree with the video there is no gender wage gap i think having a wage gap is all mental a trick your mind plays because we see a large number of successful people being males an example from group  presentation would be the magazine forbes this magazine is successful people and most of the people on their front cover have been males i has agree with there being no wage gap from the beginning of speaking about the topic but never thought of speaking out and giving my opining because i thought i would been criticized and be looked as a bias person the fallacies in the argument is just like said in the video and command sense and its all about the choices each gender makes its command sense because if a guy and a girl both work at mcdonald they are both getting paid minimum wage same amount of money for the hour but all depends who wants to work more and longer hours an example how choices is key to an argument like the wage gap would be the saying of females live longer this is because its usually the male who pull out ridiculous dangerous stunts that sometimes kill them its all in the choices one makes there is no difference on how much females and males get paid like the video there is no gender wage gap they explain how the number  out of  dollar and that is just what average females make divided by what the average male makes all the factors that fall in to where the money goes people make counts too like said by the website the wage gap state by state that most families depend on the females overall its the factors and choices one makes that make males look like they are getting paid more,2,NOT
actually they do take into account occupation education and position another part of the wage gap is that men are more likely to get bonuses than women who work the same hours and are more likely to get promoted if a women tries to discussnegotiate a higher salary then she is needy if a man does the same hes a leader,2,NOT
the average highschool teacher earns less than the average ceo the teacher must be under oppression,2,NOT
for every  dollar a man makes a woman makes  quarters,1,NOT
i always thought the wage gap was a bit dubious,3,NOT
yes keep preaching,1,NOT
 you have to remember femenists dont have common sense,5,ABU
my new hero she has put common sence,2,NOT
this video has so many likes because only men watch prager u,1,NOT
just a well made video the editing was fantastic the woman in the video was great for the roll very nice,2,NOT
this is incredibly misleading because women make choices of professions that are mother and family friendly and these professions are not as valued in our us capitalist society as are others to where men flock due to higher wages prestige and power,2,NOT
i fix garbage trucks for  hours a week on average most people only work  hours now find how many will climb in the back of a garbage truck in ankle deep garbage juice broken glass and hydraulic oil to spend  hours replacing a cylinder while maggots are crawling around you compare that to answering a phone,2,NOT
careful logic and reasoning hurt liberals its hard for them  dont want to stop their feelztrain from rolling along it might be considered assault to think with logic and reason by the left,5,ABU
so basically women just dont have the mind set to work out of there house and their just lazy or to weak for more serious jobs that requires men,3,NOT

jobs with higher risk and uncertainty are more paid men have a tendency to be riskier than women,2,NOT
praise this lady,1,NOT
i will download this video if possible,1,NOT
the fact that women earn  cents for every dollar that a man makes for the same work is bs however lets look at why women make those choices how dod people perceive a woman who decides to dedicate her life to her job instead of finding a husband and having kids how does society view a women who is willing to be on call at all times she is probably a total btch who is going to become an old cat lady with no friends okay so she decides to get married if she works all of the time early in the relationship to try to climb the ladder so she is earning a lot of money people ask why she doesnt spend more time with her husband people ask when she is going to start having children people say things like your biological clock is ticking not to mention if the woman earns more than the man the man is looked down on by society for not providing for his woman on the other hand if the man works long hours and then takes his woman on lavish vacations and buys her nice things people look at how wonderful of a life the couple have now lets say that the woman decides to have children having any job at all people look down on her shouldnt she be home with the children say shes a lawyer and really values her work but the man is willing to be a stay at home dad or do something with shorter more predictable hours on the side now people are flipping their lid because not only is the man not providing for his family like he should but the kids should have their mother at home with them flip roles and suddenly it is just fine the problem isnt that businesses pay  to woman what a man makes but that woman are pressured to sacrifice their career in a way that men arent thats not to say that you dont have to pick and choose what your priorities are or anything if raising a family is more important than working a high paying job then by all means follow your dreams however that is something that a couple should discuss before starting a family and society should stay out of that families business if the mother wants to be a high earning business professional or a lawyer who works  hoursweek while the father works from home as a computer programmer so that he can be with the kids great if the father wants to work the long hours and the mother wants to do something more flexible also great if they both want to work hours that are unpredictable and long well they should think of that before starting a family but both parents should be held responsible not just the mother as soon as society buzzes off thats when the wage gap will disappear,3,NOT
ha lol feminists take that,3,NOT
the best psa,1,NOT
what i dont understand is why there are women that get angry when you tease them for being a house wife when that is literally the best lifestyle you could possibly get,2,NOT
subbing for this,1,NOT
where i work we are required to use some equipment that is a bit heavy all the female employees refuse to use it and pass it off to the males to use we male employees as gentlemen dont argue and just do the job both the male and females are paid the same now where would anyone argue that these female employees actually do deserve to be paid the same when they refuse performing part of a job because they physically cannot do something or just refuse to do something if anything making men do something the females are allowed to refuse is discriminating towards men,2,NOT
woman do get payed less but it depends on the country though i saw this video fully i have done research and i still think there is a wage gape but its not as bad as people think well at least in some countries,3,NOT
brilliant and enlightening video i was only hoping you wouldve talked a little about the women working fulltime that decide to have a baby and raise a family i was curious to see the possible relations between this and the wage gap,2,NOT
this is still where you are incorrect about any kind of earnings gap pertaining to gender the gap doesnt exist at all to say that it is still only  makes anyone with this claim incorrect this is why politics suck a specific political stance will try to generalize everyone and think they are compatible within the generalization we are not like apples and oranges the comparisons are more like beets and bananas there has been a controlled scientific study that took a singular case under extreme measures to further disprove such a myth the males and females were of same age applying for the same position ethnicity and even the experience behind it the employer was told that the first  being hired could not have an increased starting pay if negotiated for it and needed  females as well as  males  from each gender had to fit low class criteria the same rule also applied for black skinned and white skinned and so it had less discriminative power the other  of each gender were going to be split the same way but of middle class this was a closed off  year experiment do you know what happened within this study the men did  more work than the average employee all  asked for more hours after  weeks this does not including job training and  asked for a raise after the first year while the counterpart female was  less productive than the average employee  females one lower class black and one middle class white took  days off after  years only one of the females asked for a raise after  in a half years additionally  of the males were looking for another part time job while working with the one they had no wonder the gap is seen as a large problem between genders males just seem to work harder and they are reprimanded for it,3,NOT
since child labor laws exist the median earnings per year for  year olds is around zero dollars but the median earnings for adults is over zero dollars so there is an infinity wage gap there,2,NOT
several femeinsts are typing,2,NOT
if it was a man in this video there would be at least x more dislikes and sexist comments spammed in the comment section,2,NOT
lol  political correctness it is just easy to spot difference but leftists are denying women are working less hours are not strong in many jobs like oil industry it is just so stupid to do the math while every men can use muscles to move furniture from van to house  not women ,5,ABU

i kinda want to translate it and post it on my facebook but if i did i would probably lose the few friends i have,2,NOT

k triggered feminists disliked,2,NOT
st century feminism is a cancer of society,6,ABU
i love how feminists like to complain about the supposed wage gap but are completely silent to the fact that women as a demographic take more money from the government than they give in taxes in short women pay no taxes and get additional money while men have to carry the entire system and get much less than that,5,ABU
i do agree in most of the video but theres a point that wasnt mention for a guy is easier to get most of the well paid jobs than a woman also uneducated jobs are mostly male dominated like construction or gardening theres a social experiment in which a boss was sent  cvs one female and one male in different professions most of the bosses including female one picked the male rather than the female as we have this patriarcal thought that male workers have more time or are more committed to their jobs also i come from colombia a country with a huge sexism in here is even illegal for women to have certain jobs,2,NOT
k feminists denies the truth,5,ABU
send this to all feminists,2,NOT
frickin hecc this video is hilarious,2,NOT
the problem isnt that women are paid less its that women are societally expected to start families and take care of their children the solution is paternity leave and having children after your career is stable,1,NOT
if we listen to feminists and really try to close the imaginary gender pay gap then women wont get paid more men will get paid less to balance it out people really underestimate capitalism,2,NOT
im genuinely surprised that gender studies was not among the  worst paying college majors ,2,NOT
women just dont work as hard as men most stay at home and take care of the house or children i dont care if thats sexist its true,5,ABU
i needed this when i was sociology class when my instructor was taking a roll call she wanted us to state a fact to why women earn less then men then she was talking about the joys of communism,3,NOT
what is a fact you might ask a fact is a antonym to a feminist argument,5,ABU
cool video but i see some inaccuracies first off you say the  cents difference exists is because of choices but that  cent number comes up when you have already factored in the difference in choices on top of that the visual is misleading because it shows the difference shrinking from  cents to  cents which is not the case the difference shrinks from   cents to  cents and then you just completely dismiss the  cents oh well we have no idea why the gap is there but just believe us when we say it doesnt exist bad way to make a video then just say the wage gap is so much smaller then a lot of us think,2,NOT
well to answer her question why business wouldnt just hire women if theyre paid less i assume that there are a number of reasons for that the most important one is probably that a lot of male company ceos consider women to be less qualified or reliably so theyre willing to hire men instead even if they cost more also the video presents the information rather misleadingly for example she says that the adjusted gender wage gap is the result of choices of the women and that she wants to look at those choices but she immediately switches back to the nonadjusted wage gap reasons that gives the impression of her explaining why the adjusted wagegap is incorrect while she actually just explains the nonadjusted wage gap the adjusted wagegap is still somewhere between  to  and even if it would be just  then the question would be still there why women should be fine with earning  less than men and why are so many guys in the comment section wanting so badly the gender wage gap not to exist what would you lose if everybody would be paid equally for the same work,2,NOT
if i could hire a woman to do the same job at less pay i would only ever higher women,3,NOT
this is absolutely amazing im about to show this to my mother in law shes a feminist nut job this is a debate weve had many times thankfully prager u has the patience to explain it lol,5,ABU
i dont like to think all feminists are bad not at all but still thank you for making this even as a female i didnt really believe this was happening not considering all the evidence against it this ad just reminded me my dream job as a psychologist doesnt pay well though aha,3,NOT
prageru is smart they find the facts double and triple check them then they get someone who you wouldnt expect to present the information they dont get a white male talk about racism they get a black female whos seen the facts and believes them they get a female to talk about sexism it makes it harder to argue against them because people cant attack the speaker for being sexist racist or privileged it avoids ad hominem arguments being used against them and makes the facts look more credible,1,NOT
screw you for making this an ad yeah its true but  minutes and  seconds is entirely too long for an ad,2,NOT

where i work at in my department we have seven men who are all doing the same job none of use are making the same wage some of us have more seniority than others some of use have more experience than others and some of us simply produce more money for the company than others factors such as this always effect how much a person is paid even if you are doing the exact same job and ladies i am going to tell you something and it will probably upset you so you might want to sit down it just might be possible that guy at work that is making more money than you is simply better than you at that job gasp,2,NOT

i wish i new this earlier because my class is mostly girls and they all had a  minute talk about this,2,NOT
currently in my campus gender wage gap is nearly nonexistent but that might be because its a little progressive,2,NOT
i have known about the wage gap for a long time but did not realize how significant it was in class we found out that some of the highest paying jobs such as petroleum engineering are primarily help by men and jobs like education positions are held by woman and they make significant less than males i think women are expected to be in these positions because of our motherly instinct what was not surprising was in some positions like serves in restaurants and retail the gap was smaller to me this job works in favor of women because they are more likely to be friendly and can get tipped on how attractive they are which is actually sexist in regards to the us men and womens soccer team wage gap the women in recent years have been more successful and have more winnings than the men but are still earning less while the gap for the top players on each team are not significantly large the further down the list the larger the gap gets between men and women pay disparity in us soccer its complicated states that women require more health insurance and there a pay cuts if they become pregnant andrew das  this is a parallel to what we read in the textbook businesses cut a year of wages for woman because they are likely to take a year off to take care of family members and maternity leave adams et al  the video there is no gender wage gap however argues there is no gender wage gap because the studies are based off of different careersschooling men in women have but how can they explain the gap between men and women that hold the same job and equal amount of education,2,NOT
too bad we need someone to explain the free market,2,NOT
i noticed that females lead jobs that help other people just something i noticed im not trying to be rude about it not sure if it takes less education but psychology takes a lot of schooling so im not sure the common factor,2,NOT
i love your citations finally i have citations,1,NOT
the women in the video have a series called the factual feminist its really good,1,NOT
no mention of the biggest driver of the pay gap motherhood this is a perfect example of a variable labelled as choice that really isnt one the fact that in  the us still proscribes to the breadwinner model is madness and the real reason women earn less than men and it is a sexist model no biological reason why women should be the primary caregivers not supported by any empirical evidence worth reading the lack of affordable childcare access to acceptable maternity leave or good quality parttime work means that mothers are hugely disadvantaged when it comes to work employers are even likely to discriminate against women of childbearing ages simply because they might have kids now you might think hey having kids is a choice that many women benefit emotionally from so why shouldnt they get penalised economically for a personal choice theres two things wrong with that firstly it isnt true for thousands of women who have unplanned pregnancies and secondly having children benefits society especially a capitalist one that needs continuous growth to survive so we should be rewarding mothers not penalising them,1,NOT
thank god someone made this video can we finally bury this wage gap myth bs now,3,NOT
i am a woman and since childhood i knew that when i have kids i will work less hours and make less money whenever i say this online and explain that this means i need to marry a man who makes a good living i get called a gold digger,2,NOT
women get paid less choices boys get worse grades rigged,2,NOT
the title is so misleading though you concede in the video that there is actually a gender pay gap you still opted to title the video in a way that explicitly suggests that theres no wage gap what a way to deceptively push your narrative as for reasoning that no one knows for sure why theres a pay gap perhaps you shouldve brought up the various studies in one of which they handed out fictitious resumes with the only difference being that one was named john a boy name whilst the other was named jennifer a girl name it found that not only was the man rated more favorably but that he was offered  more than the female candidate i dont know about you but i believe thats gender discrimination right there,2,NOT
i love christina hoff summers,1,NOT
really glad this has so many views and positive comments in  weeks this means the tide is finally turning away from the sjws hopefully theyll be a myth in a few years,3,NOT
thank you for saving me from feminists,5,ABU
i work in a warehouse where they actualy pay quite good its male dominated job obviously anyway they decided to start recruit women who actualy managed to stay  days max and left because they couldnt handle thy physical job,2,NOT
geez took u long enough,2,NOT
why dont businesses only hire women i mean if that were the problem they would just pay men less i dont really have a stance on the wage gap but if the gap were true no one is forcing businesses to pay a different wage so they wouldnt only hire women they would pay men less,2,NOT
will pewdiepie be on there about the subscribers gap,2,NOT
it isnt sexism its just common sense ,2,NOT
gap is opposite women are promoted early to pump corporate management quotas those underqualified women therefore make less than their much older counterparts extending the  myth companies then forced to raise executive womens pay at the expense of males quotas and glassceiling myths drive womens pay higher and higher while any look across any management tier shows underpaid and underage women thus perpetuating the gendergap myth,2,NOT
this is facts,2,NOT
anyone who disliked the video is probably a feminist,3,NOT
businesses dont hire only women because they legally cant and i know for a fact that some businesses pay women less at least in alabama,2,NOT
why do people actually think there is a wage gap,2,NOT
the fact that this is a debate is concerning,2,NOT
really if a man is at beck and call he is considered a provider if women do it they are bad mothers but i am sure that double standard and other societal implications were looked to in detail in part two of this video,2,NOT
you know why the gender wage gap exists because women suck at statistics too,5,ABU
now this is a woman i would want for president,2,NOT
i am not a feminist and this video does set some facts but without drawing the conclusions from them i have to say that  as a woman i observe that men are sometimes if not regularly macho towards women even in a way that they may perceive as normal or harmless i dont believe its always purposely mean but therefore they do not respect women entirely while its much more more rare that a woman would have any kind of despise towards men just for being men women usually value men as much as themselves  if its true that women often make choices that lead them to less well payed jobs its partly because they are surrounded by social messages that tell them some jobs are for men and they wouldnt fit in it im not saying its caused by all men nor that all women suffer from it but its true for a certain prcrentage of people and may explain the unexplained wage gap in this video which is ridiculously presented as unexplained while the answer is im sorry quite obvious and quite real once again im not saying that women are all oppressed by men but men make the more social oppression as they make the more sexual assaults take this as a remark from someone who doesnt care about gender when looking at someone but about respect and truth,2,NOT
how to solve all political debates to the most extreme launch nukes at china and russia,5,ABU
glad to see another video by based mom always a pleasure,2,NOT
also if the wage gap shrinks to  cents thats still technically a wage gap,1,NOT
 my highschool teach made me write a report on feminist i said i was a anti feminist because they complain about non existent problems like the wage gap  and i said one of the reasons women get paid less is because they dont work as much as men the women first laughed then i show this video then they just got pissed,3,NOT
feminists dont like her woman debunks radical feminists favourite myth with this simple trick nearly died,2,NOT
feminists will never give up the  cent myth they realize that it is their greatest weapon feminists argue that women are underrepresented in upperclass fields but it certainly isnt due to discrimination  of all colleges have affirmative action policies that favor women and discriminate against men,5,ABU
if only i didnt need youtube red to save this video without a virus,1,NOT
the problem here is they dont give a shit that theres mountains of justification to why theyre paid less they want equality regardless of if they deserve it or not hence why they want to tax the rich out the ass to give to poor people who havent earned it logic doesnt matter to these people,5,ABU
i love this person we need more women like her,2,NOT
also people obsessed with the wage gap i want to make this as clear as possible going around and blaming some secret sexist cabal of men and taking it out on your coworkers and claiming that theyre womenhaters or we is stupid men and women in theory strive equally to get paid and earn raises however a store that employs  people may have only  people actually in control of the salary those two to three people may or may not be as sexist as you think they are but taking it out on your coworker who is more interested in getting home to snuggle up to his so and spending time with the family and is doing his best to keep himself awake and in a positive mood while pouring over boring as hell spreadsheets or putting up with some idiot customer who firmly believes that  off applies to every item in the store instead of a specific product is only going to earn you animosity he probably doesnt set the wages he may even be mad as hell that hes putting in overtime and working extra hard but got passed over so the ceo could give himself a nice bonus he may even have a wifesisterdaughter who isnt getting paid what she should be and the entire family is suffering for it or hes doing his absolute best in his dwindling spare time to fix that accusing him of sexism is about as useful as getting mad at a chicken and accusing it of causing obesity,2,NOT
im convinced,2,NOT
this woman is amazing,1,NOT
i want you morgan freeman or drshaym as president,2,NOT
this is just impressive,1,NOT

shes the reason i subscribed  ,1,NOT
i honestly dont care about all of the drama or hate i love that freelees message is getting out there why does our generation highlight the less important shit like drama instead of what will help in the long run animals need to survive we cant keep killing them what about the future generation what if the majority of animals get extinct and they dont even know what they look like it makes me so sad,1,NOT
trisha films her videos in advanced she could have made this video three weeks ago and already ate vegan foods like she said in the video for two weeks,1,NOT
i think she ate chicken,2,NOT
this is amazing,1,NOT
trish when you said that you started to care about animals suffering thats the moment i knew you would succeed if you go on a vegan diet for superficial reasons just to look better trust me it is so mentally destructive you end up feeling like binging just to rebel against a very restrictive regime but if you connect with the animal suffering then eating animal products will not even cross your mind it will not feel like a diet anymore every meal will be you taking a stand against abuse and contributing to a better world it will give your life so much meaning and purpose and bring you so much happiness i promise,1,NOT
 go freelee go spread your good message,1,NOT

why do i want to cry lol,1,NOT
i think if she started making vegan cooking videos and would show all the yummy vegan food there is and if she did loads of other vegan associated videos without targeting anyone i think alot more people would turn vegan i have been thinking about turning vegeterian i eat meat but since im only  and my whole family eats meat it wouldnt be that easy but i really hope that more people will turn vegan or even vegeterian,1,NOT

freelee can you also make videos for trish focussing on how eating animal products not eating enough plant foods and not eating a steady supply of healthy energy fucks up her mental health this would be a big one for her too going vegan helped me so much with my mental health problems simply because of the reduction of inflammation in my body the loads of nutrients from plants and the steady supply of glucose to my brain i mean i know you know what i mean because you have experienced the same its time trish got some relief from her mental problems,5,ABU

this is bad journalism more trans athletes perform above average then below or at the biological changes are not confirmed to the more fiat then muscle the didnt mention the trans mma male turned female who obliterated her opponents fair huh abc did present facts to case but did also twist to a social trend and not ethical in any way good morning america has also bombed the journalism mark by doing the same time and time again by presenting elements of a story to fit the scheme not the story at hand,2,NOT
you are a fucking boy,5,ABU
these are guys,5,ABU
they need their own league unfair advantage over the girls theyre still men,5,ABU
totally unfair one of them was completing in mens track a month prior dont know of an argument that can be made that makes this fair especially if its a girl who is looking for a scholarship and loses out because of these two the transgender parents think their kids happiness is more important than the happiness of another child which is telling then the trans kids echo the sentiment when asked if they were on the receiving end like those that are biologically female their answer as long as the kids that are transgender are happy than that should make me happy not said in those words but that was the sentiment and i dont care of they take hormone therapy for a couple,5,ABU
sick this dude thinks hes a woman doesnt mean he is he needs to compete with his own body build and gender and see how well he does in an equal competition,5,ABU

women wakeup the want to replace you,5,ABU
hilarious well women wanted this so live with it took over there washrooms jobs and now there sports,5,ABU
simple solution to theze sickos that call themselves transgenderzlet them only compete in sports among themselvesend of story  it is sick  wrong for a male to be allowed to compete against a female in theze kind of sportsperiod  ,5,ABU
a transgender male is not a female it is wrong to allow them to compete with females if they have male bodies its not fair to the actual females they are being cheated,5,ABU
it is not right they are not girls and are not able to be traced for doping because they can easily stop the female hormones and gain an edge thats the issue they also have male brains and theyre dopamine levels are totally different from girls their fight or flight is different stature is different they arent competing with all of the female characteristics that make women a bit slower compared to them let them compete but it needs to be a fully trans team we wouldnt have able bodied people in the para olympics because they feel disabled right so im just saying  at the end of the day they are still chromosmallly boys soon to be men living as transwomen wear what you want  present yourself how you want love who you want no issues with that but this is not fair at all hell we even make sure kids of certain ages cant compete against certain groups in schools we just need trans teams and then that will be fair just my opinion nototransphobia yestofairness,5,ABU
its not fair for all the female athletes that train their hardest just to be beat by someone who is naturally more advantaged,5,ABU

anyone whos keeps there mouth shut on this  that has kids on that track team in that school are cowardly shits you are all sheep youre being controlled by the far left the socialist and the democratic party  these are too big men two big gay men who wont admit theyre gay or theyre just lying about wanting to be women deep down anyway just so they can play the system and get a total on a unfair advantage to win against women they are not women they are men they are men they were born with men they have big men muscles they are fucking men  before any of you call me homophobic i was raised by a gay man who is a man a male and proud of it and he was also proud to be gay being gay is a natural biological sexual preference transgender is bullshit its people who wont admit that they are gay and the huge evidence supports that,6,ABU
yall dumb and ignorant with these comments didnt u hear that there on hrt i understand the advantage in the beginning but once on hrt for  months they have the same estrogen levels and testosterone levels as a cisgenderd woman biological woman in fact there probebly at a cardiovascular disadvantage due to the advirse affects of hrt has on the body,1,NOT

comimg in first and second place respectively are you serious this is such a joke they shouldnt even be there its not fair at all sorry but your child should either not be allowed to participate on the girls team and participate on the boys teams or not participate at all period this is not fair to girls they are not girls you throw on some fake hair and nails and now youre a girl ummm no you are still males males should compete against males not with females what is wrong with society  students identify as trans and they can come in and change everything around just like that this is utterly ridiculous,5,ABU

i was born a female i grew up a tomboy i played tackle football and hockey still female i have a shaved head dont wear makeup and am tattooed still female i dated a gay guy long story  still female i am super independent opinionated and outspoken still female i think her video confession does more harm than good,1,NOT
watching her face appear after yoursdamn,2,NOT
okay i agreed with all of this apart from when you started talking about sam smith they have mentioned multiple times before coming out properly that they were non binary and have since and its clear they are and their not just doing it for clout because as well thats not the type of person they are,1,NOT
the title is just like saying no youre not a female you were born with a penis come on instead of making videos for clout help the person out trisha is confused or maybe going through something that no one can control mental illness sick,2,NOT

this trisha thing is pretty damn ugly how can any normal person well we all know that normal people arent in this equation think that this hot stinky mess is attractive and even worth following or even paying any attention to i wonder the kind of person who listens to and takes advice from this wonderfully dumb and woefully ignorant trend setterinfluencer are there that many mentally ill people out there this woman here is a fine example of the pitiful and painfully stupid state that so many young people suffer from nowadays were in a very sad state of affairs if these kids are our future and will be the ones to eventually ruin i mean run this country i would say that i worry for our future but i think that we are well past that right now with all of these bright kids our future doesnt look so bright just sayin,5,ABU
oh honey we are all attracted to gay men bc they take care of themselves dress well and go to the gym that doesnt make you anything trans people have power when people are begging to be part of the club,2,NOT
hi blaire i wanted to comment about the trisha situation i can admit honestly that up until now i did not always agree with your message mainly i didnt understand where it was coming from truly i am in a similar spot as some other younger trans people and i have to say things like this do not help its improper representation of trans people and its awful how trisha felt the need to capitalize as you mentioned but when this is one of the more trending videos this is what people associate us with and it is hurtful because it does indeed feel like trisha is mocking our very real struggles also i have learned so much about how to discuss these things across your videos overall that helped me shape my own understanding i just wish at the end of the day we honestly could help eliminate these problems im just surprised that gigi being a trans woman herself would support trisha i know her heart is in a extremely good place but it makes me wonder if gigi actually thinks that,2,NOT
 i had the same reaction lol,1,NOT
i feel like if you take her seriously thats already a problem like literally her whole history is built off of people looking at her and going wtf and getting a laugh im not mad about it thats just trish lol edifwhen i say you i mean everyone in general,2,NOT

i feel bad for her she looks like she has some pretty serious issues this is what happens when being transgendered becomes a fad with lots of misinformation surrounding it people who are not in the best mental health glom onto that idea as an explanation for their problems and self diagnose instead of actually unraveling whats actually causing them mental distress i couldnt watch this trisha looks a mess and i dont think youtube fame or infamy is going to help her situation,2,NOT

you look gorgeous blaire ,1,NOT
i was on a butch and femme internet forum many femme lesbians claimed that they are transgender i wondered why they told me that gender means the social role of a woman or a man and they have a diffrent gender role as a woman they live not the ecpierience of a heterosexual woman thats why they live a diffrent gender as a woman thats why they see themself as transgender i can not describe it as well as they did  but i think i described the reason as good as i understood what they told me well the opinions diverge for me i am trans i can not agree with those femmes but i am also male as well as female not on body but on my inner being i transform between the two,1,NOT
i agreed with your assessment  but then i watched her apology video and now i dont know pleaae respond to that video as well i now think shes having some major issues and just looking for a way to fix those and thinks this is the way its not and she definitely needs a new therapist,2,NOT
trisha paytas more like trisha gaytas hahahahahahaha goddem,3,NOT

ok trisha is literally so dumb,3,NOT
is this the real life or is this fantasy,2,NOT
jokes aside if shes being serious this is pretty much a prime example of what terfs think all trans men are people who went through some shit because theyre women and think that disliking sexism and performing peak femininity makes them a literal man rather than a normal woman lol her constant talking about uncomfortable experiences and liking gay men more than straight men because they wont objectify her or treat her poorly and her literally saying herself she has penis envy makes it glaringly obvious shes not dysphoric shes just a woman who hates todays gender roles and standards which again is normal terfs are gonna be aaaaalll over this shit going see tra cult is kidnapping our vulnerable wombyn,2,NOT
 look at the beautiful orange baby,1,NOT
trisha obv doesnt know basic maths   ,2,NOT
blaire your skin looks fuckin pristine,1,NOT
wooooow gigis face is so masculine,2,NOT
ill give her the benefit of the doubt but if she comes out as just trolling i wouldnt be surprised,2,NOT
i dont think every single person who is nb or experiences nb dysphoria is making it up i think thats probably real however i think its probably rare and has nothing to do with random gay boys youre just a queen babe youre  gay you are flaming and youre femme i dont think the guy from queer eye is just a gay guy a really really gay guy,2,NOT
i dont recommend using headphones for this video the audio completely broke lol but the video makes up for it ,2,NOT
sweetie your hair doesnt match your extensions also dont claim you want to make this channel about exposing pedophiles but befriend pedo adam,3,NOT
blair sitting in the kitchen floor is everything ,1,NOT
their muscles are glisteningin th in the wind huh,2,NOT
although i agree with most of your commentary about trisha i dont think it was fair to pull in other peoples gender identities and accuse them of doing it for the sole reason of getting clout just because they dont base their entire personhood on their gender identity and make every conversation about it,2,NOT
gigi is on some shit,2,NOT
i constantly get crushes on straight girls guess im a straight man,1,NOT
i wish she didnt have such a big platform,2,NOT
blair white youre the best always keeping it real,1,NOT

i honestly feel like trishas just confused,2,NOT
so  im aaa  man ,2,NOT
this is just attention seeking,2,NOT
gigi is a twit doesnt she realise that trisha is taking the piss and making a joke of trans people,3,NOT

til gay dudes with a straight guy fetish are straight women,2,NOT
crap now im hungry,1,NOT
if i was that confused id be stuck on my kitchen floor too dead in a pool of urine,3,NOT
im so glad you talked about nonbinary being just a fad sadly my  yo granddaughter has a best friend who identifies as nonbinary and it has caused my granddaughter to vehemently defend this as a thing now i absolutely love her friend because shes really sweet and often talks my granddaughter off her hormonal cliffs i just wish shed be who she really is im hopeful though she actually joined dance with my granddaughter though her primary athletic interest is roller derby but its cool to see her at least exploring something more feminine she doesnt even use her feminine name and only goes by a nickname that is genderless she also calls it gender neutral vs nonbinary but i think thats basically the same thing at least it seems to be,5,ABU
the amount of shade that the beginning of the video has is killing me ,2,NOT
officially been trolled by trisha lol,2,NOT
lol  the insinutation that trisha  gigi arent very intelligent ok dexter,2,NOT
you have to be one of the most genuine truthtelling humans out there and you do it respectfully and i respect that   despite calling people dumb theres a thought train there not a nonsensical stream of unconsciousness you go girl ,1,NOT
is society trying to pretend that tomboys dont exist or have we simply forgotten people who say that they are nonbinary or insert obscure gender here are so weird because gender presentation  physical sex and personality  gender presentation theres nothing wrong with not being masculine or feminine but it seems as though people are just trying to gain oppression points by making up genders trans people people who are actually trans and not just transtrenders are valid because they have an actual health condition their transgenderness is vindicated by science but the trans community needs to practice gatekeeping any trans person needs to have doctoral proof that they have the medical condition,5,ABU
she is known for making troll videos shes just doing it for views,2,NOT
i swear she also came out as a chicken nugget once lmaoo,1,NOT
good that you highlighted that masculinityfemininity has nothing to do with gender it hasnt got anything to do with sexual preference either i consider myself quite feminine but also quite heterosexual and quite cismale,2,NOT
its sad because she needs drama to stay relevant,2,NOT
trisha is the embodiment of rnotlikeothergirls,2,NOT
how long till she comes out as retarded,5,ABU
brave of her to try to bring the yes im a vegan yes i eat meat meme back from the dead,2,NOT
im a pretty masculine chick but that doesnt make me a trans man im just a little more manly than a lot of women,1,NOT
i like how she stopped with the trans stuff,2,NOT
wow nonbinaryphobe it existed before  people just didnt have a name for it also do you think that trans people need to take hormones to prove their transness or something thats the height of truscum,1,NOT
omg those nails and what the fuck is up with her face too much plastic surgery,3,NOT
so i have a dilemma im a young trans guy i have not medicly transitioned yet though i plan to but thats beside the point theres this guy i like and he dosent know im a guy but he keeps flirting with me in my th hour class and thats about the only time i see him so i dont know how to tell him im a trans guy like what do i say how do i bring that up in a conversation and if i do what if hes not gay or what if he is and he dosent want to date me cause im not cis like i sreriously need so advice,1,NOT
love you blaire you killing ppl in these youtube streets lol somebody gotta check these hos  im dead,2,NOT
i dont think she understands what transgender  means,2,NOT
i dont know why anyone is even making videos about this because thats the only reason she made that video in the first place shes a master troll and only wanting people to talk about her and make her more money so by talking about her were literally just rewarding her shitty behavior,2,NOT
i have been waiting for this vid need queen blaires touch on this,1,NOT
trisha just wants a label for herselfinvolving with the lgbtq community gotta get dat clout some way or the other wannabespecial,2,NOT
hey just wanted to say how awesome you are and how much i learn about the trans community through you i had a question about something you said in this video about feeling feminine or masculine is not about gender i  percent agree with that statement so my question is as a trans woman what was it that made you realize that you were a female born in a mans body if it wasnt the fact that you felt more feminine than a man im sorry if this question is insensitive i definitely am ignorant to so many things that you and other trans women and men go through,1,NOT
the voice of reason yet again thanks blaire,1,NOT
oooh you hatin on herhim whatever tf you are who tf cares i get what heshes sayin duh just leave the children and babies out of your sik af satanic luciferian occult rituals okay stop trying to indoctrinate the people and the innocent children okay and stop making them strip and pole dance okay you freakin disgusting sodomites from hell i luv your channel btw i think that youre a beautiful open transperson and appreciate your commentary on leaving the children out of the madness hun ,5,ABU
im screaming whatvis she thinking dndndjd,2,NOT
ugh blaire the queen ,1,NOT
i still dont get why trolling is an excuse shes coming off incredibly shitty being shitty whether shes crazy or trying to be funny its shitty either way shes gone full logan paul gay for a month like this is her equivalent lmaoooo,2,NOT
the u cut that hair hair part is kinda stereotypical tho lol,2,NOT
ummm yeah the majority of crushes i have st sebastian frodo antinous  aka the holy trinity of hotness are at least somewhat associated with being gay  especially antinous so according to trishas logic i guess i should start identifying as a  drag queen now in all seriousness god bless everyone online and irl who are willing to put up with all my classical curlyhaired manloving crazy  anyways off from that tangent keep up the awesome work blaire white youre gorgeous funny intelligent and very entertaining to watch,1,NOT
i dont get why she would even troll about this then again im not trisha and im not such an attention whore this does showcase the ease with which these statements are accepted in certain places which disturbs me can we please get all the poor souls coming out as trans psychological help most of the younger ones have a lot of other issues too and believe those should be treated first depression is shite anxiety is shite ptsd sounds like hell no matter how you look at it a lot of trans people need help in more ways than one i dont think trishas behaviour helps one bit it does feel a little bit insensitive and the internet just isnt the place for these kinds of troll vids it would fit better on stage in the show of a comedian as a side note i get annoyed with the gender is a social construct thing technically gender is a social construct if you view in the way that gender is the way you express your feminity or masculinity which nobody means when they use the word gender in this context and sex is biological however when people use it interchangeably im thinking theyre wrong otherwise there wouldnt be a need for certain people to even feel trans nevermind actually go through the medical roller coaster in one way or another,5,ABU
shes trolling and you all are retarded,3,NOT
i love that youre drinking out of a chikfila cup,1,NOT
her name is trashy ptasse  french for biatch okay i am out,2,NOT
why is everyone defending her like shes just shitposting duh i only see that she makes a big joke out of the trans community as if there wasnt still a long way for society to accept trans people what this wailing goblin babbles in this video is not exactly helpful,2,NOT
thank god for you blair thank you for this xx some truth finally,1,NOT
you dont pull ugly faces you pull comically appropriate very expressive faces,1,NOT
paytas clearly took a swan dive off the high dive when the pool was empty shes clearly touched in the head and a few nuggets short of a happy meal,3,NOT
i dont wear makeup like ever pretty much i must be trans  i dont understand what trish is trying to do anymore,2,NOT
man im pretty sure trisha is not trans but i kinda can understand the confusion somewhat what i mean is im autistic and apparently  of all autististic people are trans  autistic men tend to have the white brain mass similar to a biological womans brain mass and so on i hear at least once a month that im trans or people really pushing to to are you sure you are not trans despite me telling them that yeah well im okay with being a woman but mentally im just behaving like a man interest in computers etc they keep pushing it and it definitely leads to some confusion of what i am whatever my passport says my gender is that itll be for now,1,NOT
ive been waiting for this i knew it was gonna come lmao,1,NOT
blair your lil boogie,1,NOT
is it weird that i used blaires wtf response as my metric for is ftm drag queen a thing,2,NOT
she has body dysmorphia not gender dysphoria thats why all the surgeries and the make up,2,NOT
i couldnt think of sam smiths name when i heard a song the other day so i looked at my boyfriend and said isnt that their song and he just looked at me crazy its sam smith who else are you thinking of i told him i was just talking about smith and he asked who is they though i explained the pronouns and he just walked away from me,1,NOT
gigi is trolling along with trisha,2,NOT
youre kitchen looks so nice i love the pink lighting,1,NOT
she has tried to say she is black a trump supporter religious a lesbian bisexual and now a trans man  ftm all of which have been retracted or presumed retracted based on anti religious homophobic racist and transphobic comments theres only one consistent thing about trisha paytas she is an attention seeking mess and i thoroughly believe she has histrionic personality disorder,2,NOT
when i saw her vid i said aiiight imma head out,2,NOT
blaire nooooo shes doing this for attention shes desperate for it deny her ass,2,NOT
guys this is the same girl that said she was a tellytubby,2,NOT
god i love blaire shes such a queen,1,NOT
i believe people shouldnt be offended by trisha doing these things even though she has a big following and a priviledge of that power i highly believe trisha makes these videos as a therapy out loud thinking she just says what she feels and she doesnt know or care about the consequences because thats for later to face she loves the attention and doesnt know how to balance her issues,1,NOT
i really hope one day everyone can fully understand what transgender really means  and can accept it and treat everyone equal,1,NOT
i like trisha but she came out as a chicken nugget not that lang ago how is anyone supposed to take her seriously now also her explanation was whack as hell,2,NOT
if only she could find a guy that identifies as a lesbian,2,NOT
at this point i cant tell if shes desperately seeking attention or theres just genuinely something wrong with her mentally,2,NOT
i got kicked from a lgbtq facebook group because i said shes full of shit,2,NOT
trisha has also came out as a chicken nugget,2,NOT
isnt she the same woman who did that video about dogs and asked if they had brains she may have been trolling in that one too but still,2,NOT
came here just to like,1,NOT
i fucking hate ur title you cant tell her what she is its confusing and theres little backstory and little reason but you dont know her and you dont know how her mind works or how she feels or even how she really acts its discrediting to think that shes being kinda cancelled for opening up wether its believable or not people identify as fucking anything they want leave her be,3,NOT
oh also did yall see the interview she had she said shes not doing any of the transitioning like no surgeries t anything she said shes gonna keep dressing and looking the same as she usually does welp theres that looks like you dont have to do the crow mukbang anymore xd,2,NOT
i think her ex and his friends made her so ashamed of being a woman and made her so ashamed of who she is that she has become so confused about who she is without them i think she genuinely thinks shes in the right mentally but she is not getting good guidance and she needs therapy i dont think she knows you have to have dysphoria to be trans maybe shes gender fluid maybe shes just ashamed of who she is either way her friends really need to help her right now,1,NOT
do anything for clout,2,NOT
repeat after me you are not a special snowflake,2,NOT

maybe all transsexual woman should stop using transgender to define themself becaus our true specificity is transsexual few years ago i had big fight about those transsexual who wanted to exclude the ones who choose to keep there genitals and named them as transgender but this is not reality being transsexuals is about hormones and not surgery someone who remove the penis does not make this person a transsexual a man whitout a penis still is a man but named eunuch so to remove a sex genitals does not make a transsexual this is the fact and the truth it is only by the hormones that we become a woman and change our body from inside it is the hormones that grow breast and modify our shape so all of those who are on a therapy of hormones to change there gender become transsexuals there is no shame to use this word it doesnt make you a sexworking person using this definition if this is why you choose not to use the real definition transgender is a generic noun to put everything in it even the alien anybody who play with there look by fantasy or anybody who is delusionals about things related to the human state transsexual is a specific noun and only people on hormones can be name like that it exclude all the others and by the way things are going it is better transgender noun is harmfull for us by the way nonbinary and else has use this to put discord in the society by doing so they destroy all the sensibility build by the pioneer from the last  years or more this is what we can observe i am a transsexual woman when some people come to me and ask if i am a transgender i correct that for transsexual becaus this is what i am really and i do not want to be associated to all the crazy people clamed to be transgender them and me are not in the same side we must stop that nonsens,2,NOT
well i identify as a size   year old and you have to fucking respect that and believe me yes im aware the scale says im  and my dl says i was born in  you have to respect what i say that i am ,2,NOT
trishas just having an identity crisis which goes with having bpd,2,NOT
she is insane and she wants more attention that is all,2,NOT
trishgirlwhat the fuck,2,NOT
i have short hair and love it i wear men clothing and i am still not sure whenever i am heterosexual or bisexual it depends and changes with time but i always go back to asking myself questions and i am proud to say i am happy with my genderfemale and to troll people like trisha did thats honestly disgusting to watch i know some people speak before they think are more loud or have some problems with  attention seeking or even have an illness or are going through hard time and are confused but thats no excuse for her,2,NOT
you literally said everything i thought i love you sm,1,NOT
omg youre iconic for eating and bitching on your kitchen floor  is trish ok tho is she having an existential crisis or is she trolling btw her face looks so differentshes lost a lot of weight but thats beside the point,1,NOT
i love blaire,1,NOT
angela should be in more videos,1,NOT
as someone who was the president of my middle school gsa has not and will not transition has never personally known a trans person who has actually transitioned i whole heartedly accept trish into the trans community,1,NOT
i never wear makeup im a man give me my privilege,1,NOT
sex is biological gender is socially constructed next,1,NOT
its just hysterical how the sjws are upset about this now you did this to yourself yall are the ones who promote the idea of everyone can be trans just cuz they say they are,2,NOT
is scrolling through recommendations scrolls by wait what shrug w ai t wh a t,1,NOT
maybe she actually feels that way that she was describing but transgender is not the term for what she is feeling at all,1,NOT
false alarm shes now questioning,2,NOT
okay but like i do not agree with trisha i dont think she is trans but when you brought sam smith and the person from queer eye into it saying they wanted to come out for clout i do not agree with that yes they might not talk about it maybe because they dont just want the attention if they just did it for clout dont you think they will make it a bigger thing than it already is yes the person from queer eye might have not came out in  but thats because not a lot of people were okay with lgbt and gender identity and things like that back then its  it is the best time to be coming out because you do have so many people supporting it and a lot more acceptance and a lot more rights not saying there arent people out there who hate but im just saying its more accepted now then it was a few years ago but with the whole trisha being trans thing yes she is obviously doing it for the clout and views no arguments on that one,2,NOT
trisha is an attention whore plain and simple shes not the only one who makes videos and post like this but she does this type of crap for the clicks and attention,5,ABU
she is the stupidest most offensive and ignorant ugly ass bitch,5,ABU
the real question is what in the hell did trisha do to her lips did she stick them in a suction pump or something,2,NOT
ok but when you ask trans people how they knew they were trans they always talk about how they identified with superficial stuff of the opposite gender so what are we supposed to think  you cant really have a female experience without being a female  but thats a whole other can of worms,2,NOT
she is money hungry she will stoop to anything just for attention,2,NOT
ha i subbed after one vid,1,NOT
 clap clap clap clap clap edit i just watched that  times over iconic,1,NOT
us is trisha trans trisha well yes but actually no,2,NOT
personally  the video doesnt impact me i know who i am the main issue that i feel a lot of us have  especially transguys like myself  is that this video will open up a whole bunch of more issues the video could promote more people assuming that they are perfectly okay with being their biological sex feeling that they are trans because they feel masculine at times and unfortunately this could lead people to transitioning then regretting it all of that aside  im sorry if my english is awful  blaire  you are just amazing and i love your videos drinking vodka should be youre intro,1,NOT
stupidity at its finest that is a very special kinda stupid too,2,NOT
now the compulsive liar claims shes got multiple personalities and insulted chloe of dissociadid and some of those with the disorder its not right,2,NOT
on the one hand i have had a change of perspective on the youre not trans thing deciding for ourselves whether someone is and isnt trans opens the door for actual bigots to be cunts to trans people just because its kind of a lesson we shouldve learned with riley at the same time if you actually say youre not trans like trisha did youre not,2,NOT

ya trisha is definitely a girly girl and not a man in any way she just likes gay guys and thinks their hot also she thinks if she is too lazy to put on makeup and hair shes a dude lols,2,NOT
i never find obviously gay men hot ive had coworkers or class mates think theyre hot but i dont cant explain it,1,NOT
the last line of holding a chic fil a cup and saying this is vodka by the way was so iconic,1,NOT

has trisha been crucified there is a line along the top of the forehead  not trans anything for trisha,2,NOT
i feel like she relates to men and drag queens and has some common interest with them but is somehow mistaking that for being trans like clearly she does not understand how things work,2,NOT

thats very transphobic of you,1,NOT
trish paytas is a prime example of how a weakminded moron can be convinced of extremely high end bullshit easily in the future this sort of shit is going to be considered an alternate form of munchausens syndrome the only barrier to it now is that these stunning and brave gag moronsuhhh individuals are getting mainstream acceptance and the thing about that is it really isnt helping them any in fact its doing the opposite if someone wants to know how this works it is entirely possible for a parent to hate their child and at the same time smother them with appears to be love at the same time how does it happen shelter them from life dont let them grow up when a parent loves their child as if that child is their possession like an inanimate object thats going through the motions of love and doing bad things to their child in order to keep that child how they want that child to be to an unhealthy extreme or your child is unhappy and they tell you they just dont want to live anymore and you hand them the gun because its what they want after all i would argue that a hovering parent or a helicopter parent can actually be worse than a lackadaisical parent neither parent is giving their children direction in a proper fashion on one hand you have children who have no supervision no leadership and and direction leading that kid to seek other people for direction more often than not were talking the wrong kinds of influences here and to tell the truth most of them are the exact same way no parents being a parent on some level they know what they are doing is wrong or bad for them but that doesnt stop them from becoming psychopaths sociopaths drug addicts thieves gang members or any number of other types of criminals out there with a hovering parent the child is clearly in control and its the parents job to make sure nothing bad happenswhile this may generate fewer bad seeds in number these little fuckers are far worse than the other side because these little shits have their parents to cover their six when they start fucking up they have a mandate to be assholes and never have to deal with the consequences because the parents keep those little fuckers from ever experiencing consequences so their bad behavior starkly overshadows all but the worst of the children raised in lackadaisical environments,5,ABU
yes between you and calvin i was so excited to see yalls inevitable videos on this circus ,1,NOT
did u just say that nonbinary ppl are invalid ,1,NOT
this is vodka by the way hahahahahahahahaha pure gold ,1,NOT
i also dont think penis envy is weird for straight women and i dont think vagina envy for straight men is weird people just wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex sometimes its not uncommon doesnt mean youre trans,1,NOT
i have to be honest ive never heard of trisha paytas and i have never seen any of your videos until right now however my judgement is seeping through just a little bit and i think trisha is  a troll  attention seeker because  shes crazy or is that offensive ron crazy people i have borderline personality disorder and someone in a fbi group mentioned tp and her bpd video so when i searched her on youtube i found this video and girl i like you you tell it like it is and i like your voice i like your demeanor and youre beautiful definitely subscribed to your videos and clicked that bell,2,NOT
as a straight guy i can testify that theres nothing hotter than lesbians making out does that make me a trans lesbian,2,NOT
trisha has to be taking the piss cute kitty btw,2,NOT
i dont wear make up and i dont dress in overly girly things guess im a man now ,2,NOT

i bet jennifer lawrence does not know these facts lol,2,NOT
i am a degreed engineer though ive moved to it  of mechanical engineering students were female whereas  of industrial engineers were women in part because men were better at simply visualizing the shapes in advanced calculus classes while industrial had more accounting and data analysis and was closer to the average womans talents you still had to pass thermodynamics material science etc but more of the courses played on womens strengths,1,NOT
this is my favorite video,1,NOT
i swear i have learned so much from these videos than i did my high school years learning actual real world problems thank you prageru ,1,NOT
 median then at  its average who has the maths problem now,1,NOT
for record this is the first video ive put on my watch later in my  years on this site,1,NOT
why does she look like hillary clinton,1,NOT
did prageru actually get something right for once,1,NOT
now there is wage gap for men ,2,NOT
im glad this video has been put here ive noticed this working at jobs myself women gravitate toward certain jobs  no one makes them its choice also true for why some jobs have more whites there  same thing i see applicants are mostly white  no one stops them from showing up they just usually dont,3,NOT
wow this video shows so much bias,2,NOT
ive got so many people to send this to,1,NOT
ugh how many times does this gender wage gap crap shit need to be debunked its getting boring,3,NOT
feminism i fear no gender inequality but that one thing facts it scares me,2,NOT
awesome video prager u helped me to become a conservative im a brazilian student and by the way thanks for portuguese subtitle,1,NOT
i particularly agree but it sometimes does happen,1,NOT
i love prager u,1,NOT
sarcasm this video is bs show me one woman who is always on call sacrifice time instead of having a family and getting married in perusing her career like i guess like a man would dooh wait oprah,2,NOT
holding meryl streep down to watch this would be like throwing water on the wicked witch of the west,2,NOT
i hate that democrats strait up lie and tell half truths to change policies and influence voters its a recipe for mass delusion i mean  percent of gun related deaths of african americans are by police but blacks kill blacks over  times more often the whole entire movement is based on lies,5,ABU
the video omits history and social context as well as clearly known facts that men by a wide margin outnumber women as chief executives in fortune  companies only  of all ceos in fortune  companies are women why men and women take different jobs is not a matter of choice but social norms history and context feminism understands these social norms to be corrosive to the broader social fabric when any sector of society has to struggle this hard to contribute that society serves its members poorly what can be the value of supporting one already dominating point of view that helps only a few what is the value of the inequality that this video supports,1,NOT
i love this woman the team making these animations keep it up d,1,NOT
thank you god someone with reason,1,NOT
school teachers need higher paychecks,1,NOT
the question is why some careers are so badly paid and what happens with non educated people i am not a feminist but i fine this not objective common sense many women in my country cant work longer because they hace to work longer at home this might apply in a rich countrymaybe but for sure not in peru,1,NOT
i love this woman  ppl like her and thunderft restore my faith in humanity,1,NOT
so there are smart people out there who wouldve guessed,1,NOT
i fully agree with all of this factors involved however dont seem to phase the people who believe in this fallacy freedom of speech is definitely at play and all are welcome to their freedom in that right i would add though that freedom of speech in expressing each opposing idea does not equate to realistic pragmatic fact opinion does not equate to fact appreciate the video keep up the great work,1,NOT
wish i had this video ready to go for my socialgy class on sexism  my professors head would have exploded ,2,NOT
hahahahahahahahaaaha you corrupt elephants know nothing,3,NOT
gonna stop you right there dont men generally work more low wage heavy labor jobs than women,1,NOT
such a nice explanation,1,NOT
where did all the feminists go ahahah,2,NOT
jeez this did a ton better than voxs video,1,NOT
there are  kinds of lies  lies damn lies and statistics,1,NOT
this isnt sexism its common sense  kristina hophsummersaka a born savage ,2,NOT
i had to come back to this video to re strengthen my sanity after having my civicshistory teacher brainwash my whole class about this,2,NOT
thank you thank you,1,NOT
i looked on the aauw website and could not find the  statistic where is it,1,NOT
yes i want some sexism im very horny and naughty now you bad bad girls,3,NOT
it doesnt matter if its  cent or  cent its still not fair to women i have female friends in the work place that get paid less than men its hapoeninb in my school it doesnt matter if its one cent it still can make a big difference,1,NOT
the wage gap is the difference between the gdp of women and men women avoid jobs like carpentry drywall plumbing roofing welding mining forestry flooring window and door installation home heating and cooling electrical wiring and power supply cement forming brick laying even for   hour with generous union benefits and lots of overtime women just dont want those jobs men to them and take home good pay cheques  feminists only look at big league ceos and corporate board rooms as the source of the wage gap when in fact the wage gap is created everytime they call for a plumber to fix their toilet or have a guy install a new tiles in the kitchen,2,NOT
i have been saying this for a long time,1,NOT
this channel is sponsored by the zionist israel aipac biggest israel lobby in america to favour israel intrest before america  dont take my words search there videos regarding israel and found out for yourself  america is controlled by the zionist jews ,2,NOT
liberals damn you facts,2,NOT
send this to evry feminozie,3,NOT
insert thank you gif,1,NOT
the video states that the wage gap shrinks to  cents once you factor out the different choices men and women make but she then proceeds to claim that the remaining gap of  cents is caused by the choices that had just been factored out of the calculations,2,NOT
so extremely rare that prager u makes an argument i agree with bravo,1,NOT
i want to talk about this at school but i know my whole school will turn on me,1,NOT
shhhh dont use logic on these people they cant take it,2,NOT
 people cant take raw facts,2,NOT
wage gap discussion tend to gravitate around these facts but shouldnt the real discussion be around what drives us toward these choices in life if were being taught into specific roles values and norms from the very young age these will surely have an effect on our career choices young girls who have technical parents  role models will more likely statistics aim for technical field girls who dont have these role models are more likely to go into the fields society media culture etc advertises for them what stops women from applying stem degreescareers isnt really an effective question now is it the same logic applies for boys and men too of course edit the points in this video are facts yes,1,NOT
my wife earns more than me around  more base plus comms were both in sales i work  more hours with almost  years more experience we sell software she gets around  linkedin opportunities a day from global software companies most of their briefings detail that they will only look at female candidates often females under  years of age,1,NOT
this video is terrible it tells the truththe truth is not politically correct,2,NOT
i freaking  christina hoff sommers,1,NOT
i found my new favorite video on internet,1,NOT
you are amazing,1,NOT
thank you for making this video that is all,1,NOT
thats a bit misleading the qiestion is why do works that are predominantly female pay worse wages the awnser to that is the institutional sexism inherent to the capitalist mod of production,1,NOT
theres a huge wage gap between the nba and wnba d,2,NOT
i totally agree with everything in this video however the title is misleading it should say maybe the gender wage gap doesnt reveal sexism in america,1,NOT
  the department of labor paper d im doing a rhetorical analysis of this video and caught that  now i want a cookie,1,NOT
video title there is no gender wage gap video content there is a gender wage gap but its womens fault iconic,2,NOT
at least they got a woman to talk about this if they got a guy to do it the feminists would have swarmed this video like an fbi raid,2,NOT
hum i agree that these numbers are controversial however it shows that the place and the occupation of men and women are still different in our societies if you want to achieve global equality and liberty any job should not be labelled as a man or a women job why women should be less interested in engineering and why men should be less interested in social organization  why do women do more parttime job  why are they more women than men staying home taking care of the children ,1,NOT
but if i pretend there is a gender wage gap for same work done changes might be made that mean i get paid more or work may get easier so why not promote this debunked myth if its rejected i lose nothing but if its accepted theres a possibility of easier work andor greater reward im not being played on for my credulity im being smart by pulling a slot machine for free nothing to lose everything to gain,2,NOT
the biology of the male and female brain is different women are better at emotions empathy and compassion where as men are more logical cold and driven its evolution and if you want to say it this way evolution due to sexism over thousands of years,2,NOT
there is a wage gapbut not in hourly positions as by law they are all equal payed positions however there is a gender and even racial wage gap once you enter into management level there is a gap there but i feel no sympathy for such people as most of america is under the poverty line so even when they are stiffed they still make more a month then most do in three,2,NOT
sjw and feminist   starts screeching horrifically,2,NOT
my wife is a doctor and im a technician she gets paid double what i make uhh so sexist,2,NOT
this is explained by the fact that all the higher paying jobs demand more time working when women are still expected to take care for children it is because the hour arent flexible enough that there is a gender pay gap corporates dont choose women even if they work at lower wages because they are not viewed as workers but rather as women who have to be available to their children at home tasks are still managed almost entierely by women even when both parents have full time jobs the gender pay gap therefore exists you should be ashamed to post such ignorant content,2,NOT
women need to be positive this gap decreases,2,NOT
one variable that i dont see discussed very often is negotiation i started a new job recently and whilst going through the application process the company made an offer i thought i was worth more than that offer so dug my heels in and negotiated i ultimately settled on a wage that was  above the initial offer its quite possible for two people with identical qualifications doing a the same job and even recruited at the same time to be getting paid differently just because one was prepared to take a risk and negotiate whereas the other just took the initial offer put on the table studies have shown that men are on average more likely to negotiate when an offer is put on the tableprobably because men are bigger risk takers and this could certainly explain some of the residual wage gap after things like qualifications experience etc are factored in again  negotiating or not is a choice people make if you chose not to negotiate can you really feel aggrieved because you end up getting paid less than somebody who did,1,NOT
one eligible thug life moment for every  seconds or so thats a great kd,2,NOT
i wish they showed this in school instead of spreading sjw lies,2,NOT
this video is pure gold and statistically more men work around the clock  hours a day to create provide for and protect us all everything that cant close or stop for a minute statistically more men pilots truckers trains ships surgeons cops firemen factory work soldiers engineers tradesmen fbi cia large farms and ranches utilities like water treatment plants infastructure work oil field work etcetera it brings a tear to my female eye much respect for both sexes out there that are actually making good things happen and actually contributing i wish videos like these could replace commercials,1,NOT
this is what i call a smart woman,1,NOT
such a good video,1,NOT
why cant i seem to find a woman who hasnt been indoctrinated into this cultural marxist version of feminism,2,NOT
i find it funny that they use a female to talk,2,NOT
its interesting how most of these antifeminists are by women,2,NOT
feminists hate hearing this because they need the wage gap myth to justify their feminism its their most convenient lie go on feminists keep choosing shitteir majors and complaining about less women in stem ,3,NOT
so theres an unaccounted for ,1,NOT
its a total and utter myth you would have to be extremely gullible and know next to nothing about stats to fall for it,2,NOT
it would be far more authoritative if they would cite the studies they reference from which aauw study are they finding that info what was the study from the usdol where did they get the nursing study from,1,NOT
those same feminists celebrities and politicians that brought us the myth of the gender wage gap are now trying to bring us a new myth climate change remember that they also brought us toxic masculinity patriarchy metoo believe her the duluth model and the family court system and more lies and atrocities why do i feel disinclined to believe them on climate change,2,NOT
yeeeeees soooooo true,1,NOT
want a real gender wage gap i was working in a factory setting where the ratio to menwomen was  the women were constantly handed easier tasks and complained about their tasks labor intensity often the men would be told to step in to fulfill the labor aspect for the women what really upsets me is that i along with other men working there are doing x a persons work while the women avoided a portion of their task and still gets paid as much or in lots of cases more traditionalism and equality dont mix well,2,NOT
if the gender gap really is a myth then thats great news it means were on the right track for equality but im noticing a distinct lack of sources in the description and it seems to only talk about america i would be far more convinced if i could check for myself where the video gets these statistics from and whether they apply outside the us,1,NOT
yeah and what if for ethical reasons you dont want to be a petroleum engineer but want to devote your life to community organization you will probably contribute more to society for a fraction of the wages this still sucks,1,NOT
i want to show this to my feminist teachers i want to see their faces ,2,NOT
and of course i got a join the nra ad on this video ,2,NOT
this is my favorite video on the internet,1,NOT
this isnt sexism this is common sense boom,1,NOT
gotta send this to my anthropology professor because he gave a because u said there is no wage gap lol,2,NOT
can people send me links to these studies and more if you guys have any im trying to dispute some girl and she wants statistics and data  help me ,1,NOT
in the video the myth of the gender wage gap it explains how even though might be a wage gap for women to men it is not large as most individuals believe it is the first time watching the video i was convinced that the wage gap may not be a big deal although going back to what we have learned in class especially in the lecture from monday we learned how the wage gap is very noticeable christina hoff mentions good topics to prove her point the one that struck out to me was if women get paid less why dont business just hire women they are less cheaper hoff has a strong stance when she explains how feminist individuals are not implementing important factors such as hours worked positions and education when they are calculating the wage gap this convinced me that the wage gap might not be as dramatic as people think it is after all these factors are implicated in the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real it shows how adjusted measurements will be made to increase the possibility to use statistics for the wage gap women have a lot of responsibility and some even say more than man for the majority of women they are the ones in charge of picking up their children and taking care of their necessities like appointments and activities such as sports therefore all this responsibility has made women take fewer hours in their jobs or not work at all it is hard to conclude a solid stance because of what both side of the wage gap leave from the leader presentation we learned how clearly women do not make the same as men although from the video once other factors are entered it changes things so when will we receive the actual unbiased information  in american household men make more money than women therefore most women work part time jobs or do not work at all if men and women are working the exact same job hours education capability and there is still a wage gap then more things should be done to stop it but only until the statistics are true in this country i believe that women still have a lot more freedom to make their own choices than in other countries,1,NOT
i can see it now colleges are sexist because the highest paying courses arent catering to females oh god you can practically taste the anger,2,NOT
men earn more and can work longer hours at higher paying jobs because women are traditionally tasked with taking care of children maybe thats where we need to work on equality in the home,1,NOT
the  figure for unexplained gender wage gap determined by the aau is cherrypicked for starting salary the gender wage gap grows to  by the time people are in their mids,1,NOT
angry feminist are typing,2,NOT
want to close wage gap step one change your major from feminist dance therapy to electrical engineering,2,NOT
love this woman,1,NOT
ok so as someone who did used to think the wage gap was more of a big deal im glad for this clarification but the wage gap isnt the only inequality between genders in the workplace is there anyone that knows of a paper that compares the salaries of women and men who work the same job i was disappointed that this video didnt cover that difference since that is probably where the ish wage gap that does exist comes from legitimate question btw im not looking to pick a fight,1,NOT
women also leave to have children which makes them riskier employees when in positions of power since you know eventually you will have to find a replacement to fill the position and also sets them back for several months per child or longer if they elect to stay home with it for longer,2,NOT
liberals are nothing but shit eaters  seriously they literally eat shit john mcafee ran for president in  for the libertarians he would hire local woman to shit in his mouth when he was living in belize,3,NOT
sooooo muchhh sense my head ahhhhh,1,NOT
its nice that this video marshals research for evidence but unfortunately its very selective and biased most glaringly the argument ignores decades of research which has looked into the role of gender and negotiation in perpetuating the wagegap on average for example women are less likely to initiate negotiations for their salaries less likely to counteroffer and more likely to make greater concessions and while this is a choice it does not follow as the video tries to claim that preference and sexism are incompatible on the contrary what the research shows is that when women negotiate assertively on their own behalf they are perceived as acting in a stereotypically incongruent manner ie not relationship oriented and are therefore viewed negatively by their counterpart in other words women have to face a tradeoff between power and likeability that men do not have to deal with which is kinda of like the definition of sexism as a result in a conscious and strategic effort to avoid social backlash  to dodge being perceived as pushy or nasty  women tend to either avoid negotiations all together or be less competitive hence they get less over the course of a career these numbers really add up fascinatingly the negotiation gendergap all but disappears when women are asked to negotiate on behalf of others they are more comfortable being aggressive and are less likely to be judged harshly for doing so as women who negotiate on behalf of others are not violating a stereotype yet this representation approach tends to put a lot of people in a difficult bind perpetuate a stereotype or wait till the system is transformed,1,NOT
so not true comparing both genders who are working the same job can show you how less is the salary women are getting please stop saying untrue information,1,NOT
the reason why they wont hire only woman because they need someone to do all the workjk,2,NOT
thank god some sane people are speaking up at last,1,NOT
i only wish the video would have addressed the but women are driven away from those high paying jobs because misogyny argument,1,NOT
i once debated this with my wife she afirmately said that the gap was from the same job in the same company then i explained her that it is a general data and asked her two things  are you willing to find a job that pays  less but have a well diversificate work hours so you can take care of our son  do you think that the avarage women would choose to sacrifice her wage for the family i didnt heard the answer but she moved on to another subject how the society dictates the role of the women,2,NOT
she sounds like a female donald trump,2,NOT
there is a factor you missed the reduction of womens salary after the maternity leave but i dont blame you at all since the united states is one of the very few countries where women dont need to receive by law a period without working when they have a son i thought i had to explain it to you,1,NOT
and there are k feminists disliking this video,2,NOT
if you compare men and women in the same jobs men unequally earn promotions and make on average  more this video misses the point because even when you compare men and women with the same jobs education levels and backgrounds women make less regardless on the occupation choices of women as a whole,1,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense  quote of the century,1,NOT
only reason male sport players get paid more is because its a reality show and more people watch them,1,NOT
completely agree great job prageru,1,NOT
this vid is very misleading very,2,NOT
asking your self why men can work more than women stupid idoti child keeping the house clean less incentivestupid idiotsa teste de cazooooooo,3,NOT
youve started a war and there is know way you can protect yourself from the femenists,2,NOT
dang a prageru video with a  liketodislike ratio i never thought id see the day welldone,1,NOT
oh my i never thought id see the day i saw something sensible as a youtube ad the day has finally come to spread sense and reason to the masses rejoice for the time is finally upon us that facts may finally win the day,1,NOT
my ducking teacher is a liar,2,NOT
i discovered a good chanel,1,NOT
if for the same work women make only  for every dollar a man makes then why dont businesses hire only women i love you lol extraordinarily well put thank you for a great video,1,NOT
i believe you may have misunderstood the argument the argument is not that there is a literal gap in which at the same job post women are paid less than men it is that systematically women are prevented or discouraged from obtaining higher paid work for a number of different reasons men are seen as more powerful wise and omniscient women are more likely to be the primary caregiver to their children women are more often than not disrespected in positions of authority because of mans insecurity etc,1,NOT
the argument that feminists are making is that they want equal pay so that means that in their eyes a female social worker should earn the same as a male eco consultant reminds me of somethingcommunism,2,NOT
why does eveytime i watch a video from this channel it feels like the person narrating is the same person,1,NOT
i showed my feminist friend this and now im a racist bigot got it totally makes sense,2,NOT
triggered someone  xd,2,NOT
just curious about wage differences among genders that hold the exact same position for example in the  top paying occupations where males dominated employment were the employed women who held the same positions with the same qualifications education and choices payed the same because that is the only relevant question imo,1,NOT
great video with a solid explanation,1,NOT
i like that they picked a woman to do it so the liberals cant go straight to calling this sexist,2,NOT
so the question remains why are fields in which men dominate paid more than the fields in which women lead the pay gap remains why are more men in the sciences that pay so well why arent more women in those fields is it a choice,1,NOT
ty i hate our modern mainstream media,2,NOT
sigh my ss teacher is making write an essay and one of the documents include the wage gap myth im gonna armor myself with knowledge and head into battle,2,NOT
what about oppotunities not given to women because one day maybe who knows they can get pregnant even if you dont have children and you dont want to have them,1,NOT
good thing i left the psychology major wow,1,NOT
the feminists choose to ignore the things that are right,2,NOT
justice at last,1,NOT
even if all of this is true what is the harm in making laws that prevent wage discrimination in the workplace,1,NOT
another point to add assuming that the wage gap exist purely due to sexism means that you also have to assume that it is men and men only involved in the hiring process,1,NOT
just because a woman is talking it is does not mean that the lies you call facts are more true,1,NOT
maybe we should be thinking instead about why men and women choose those college majors theres a reason many women dont choose stem fields as a woman who majored in math i can tell you that it is not easy being one of the very few females in all of my classes luckily i had a very strong support system from my family and friends or else im not sure i would have made it its easy to see that the problem isnt the jobs its the reason for picking the job and college major in the first place,1,NOT
if you dislike this video you are ignorant,2,NOT
you couldnt have waited two days to post this,1,NOT
remaining oblivious to facts and reason regarding the wage gap propaganda in the us is far too lucrative for the neofeminist movement to abandon without the ghost of patriarchy to chase there are few gendered causes to rally around and individuals within the movement are left only with introspection which almost never yields the results anticipated our society does indeed have issues that require addressing but as long as neofeminists continue to taint each with the attitude that men are the sole cause for these problems many people from both genders will be reticent to become allies for these causes neofeminism  having equal opportunity yet demanding equality of outcome,2,NOT
agreed with this long ago we needed this video long ago,1,NOT
it was smart for you guys to place a voice actor instead of a male because of feminist well played ,2,NOT
finally someone with common sense,1,NOT
very well done video bvery informative very impressive,1,NOT
one of the variables for the  cents left is maternal verse paternal leave in australia employers are at least legally binned to offer  weeks paternal leave verse something like  weeks i think im not  sure for maternal leave so even if both people take their maximum allotted leave and come back with their spouse taking care of the child the man will still work more hours the pay given is still equal but less than they would earn than when theyre working therefore there is at least part of that  cents probably a large part due to it being not even mentioned in this video,1,NOT
i completely agree i only wish your editor could spell way gap,1,NOT
feminists can never use this card against me my own mother makes nearly two times more money than all of her male colleagues because her rank degree scale and years of work experience is much higher,2,NOT
even though many things in this video are correct we shouldnt forget that the main driving factor in wage gap today is having kids women without kids in the first world countries earn the same as men women with  very much not the same goes for men if they are the primary care taker but due to traditional gender roles this is rare this is what the gender gap is primarily about,1,NOT
as a leftleaning individual i can say that this is a very welldone video this kind of content is exactly why i subscribe to prageru and would love to see more of because it uses facts and research as opposed to anecdotes to challenge a particular view it could only be made better if they were to cite every claim they make and link in the description so we can follow up on them there are certainly other videos by prageru that do make me suspicious of the source and i feel a better argument could be made if those were cited leftleaning because id rather not identify by party because neither side is  correct on everything and to place that label on yourself is to put yourself into a box where you feel pressure to defend your ideologys world view as opposed to your personal world view,1,NOT
thank you prageru,1,NOT
for my work i work as much as i can im only  years old and i work  hours a week sometimes i have been sent to a different country to work the day before i knew i was going i can go in at any time too so therefore my wage is big but still my other colleagues mainly femalewill say that its a wage gap so i simply shh,2,NOT
as someone who has studied labour economics and with some statistics training this is one incredibly hard question in both technical and philosophical level we need to distangle all the contributing factors to wage which is never a possible thing to do second labour market itself is distorted in so many ways and the pricing mechanism isnt just one orrange is just like another orange in other market we are pricing people here even assuming we are living in a perfect world that we can price every factor goes into the wage experience education is it morally just to pay women less for the factor like pregnancy maternity leave that can negatively affect the operation of a company,1,NOT
feminists we are gonna stop sexism by using sexism me defuq,2,NOT
i want to know the reasons why someone would dislike this video is there something that wasnt accounted for or is it inaccurate,1,NOT
ah yes finally someone who shows the truth there is no wage gap women are just lazy get off your ass and go for those jobs want to have a child well you better be able to work during your delivery if you want to match the work of your coworkers  sexual harassment stop making excuses about why you cant get promoted a male dominated industry for decades well i guess women havent been trying hard enough for decades ps for the morons or the ignorant this is sarcasm,2,NOT
k dislikes of feminist,2,NOT
 if women only make  cents for every dollar a man makes why dont businesses hire just women explain that women who take advantage of the wage gap myth to earn more than men,2,NOT
next time i run into a feminist im showing them this video,2,NOT
the argument that educated activists are making about the inequality in overall pay is that women gravitating towards lower paying majors is the issue systematic sexism is the problem i personally have never claimed that individual businesses are paying women less though that may be true for some it is the expectations of women in society that are the real problem we need to advocate for encouraging young women and showing them that they are capable of pursuing careers in male dominated fields the expectation that women must be the primary carers for children which in itself is no issue but the expectation is is another problem that forces women from getting demanding jobs this videos points did not address this problem at all and instead made the points supporting the inequality argument much clearer systematic sexism is the problem not an abundance of individual sexism in each employer focus on the real issues please not responding to a tangential point,1,NOT
fiance pay a ton its because the men dont hire women,1,NOT
wait it seems at first that they say their isnt any gap but at the end they say there is im confused,1,NOT
soif i decide to become a model right now  i am male  overweight according to feminists can i demand the same payment as the angels from victoria secrets in order to do not have a wage gap ,2,NOT
to be honest before i clicked i thought it would be ben shapiro,1,NOT
i believe the small gap observed in those studies is due to not controlled variables such as negotiation skills and risk aversion men are just more aggressive than women on the labor market we take more chances and expose ourselves more we are more willing to risk stability for higher compensation elsewhere needless to say those variables are hard to control,1,NOT
you didnt include sex work industry  female these women are making lots of money off men and still enjoying what men have to offer,1,NOT
feminist at work should see this videooh wait shed dismiss it anyway once they buy into the lie they arent capable of critical thinking,2,NOT
sees my major as one of the top  worst paying jobs dies a little on the inside feeling i made the wrong choice,1,NOT
of all days for my ad block to fail and show me this as an ad it has to be on womens day beautiful,2,NOT
i love you,1,NOT
at my workplace the only staff that works a full  hours on friday are literally just the men my female coworkers take  hours to accomplish what it is taking the men just  hours so come friday all the women punch out when their  hours are completed while the men stay and do their work for them its no wonder men are looked at as being more dedicated,2,NOT
if inflexible work policies disproportionately impact women then they are sexist,1,NOT
love this stuff,1,NOT
this channel has their shit straight,1,NOT
feminazis always try to play this off by saying that women are swayed towards certain jobs from a young age,2,NOT
i wanna slap my sister for believing in feminist propaganda,3,NOT
youtube has pushed all the debunking videos on this far far down in america search results took forever to find one debunking video but a bunch of videos are on top perpetuating the propaganda just had to let that be known youtube aint slick,2,NOT
i havent done enough research to form an opinion on the wage gap but the condescending tone of this video really doesnt help its credibility,1,NOT
could you please start placing some of the major sourcesstudies in the description transcript for more convenient access,1,NOT
 and men negotiate their salary more often and with better results than women,1,NOT
sjws have no economic concepts of anything all they know how to do is to burst into a loud rage based on nothing but emotion,2,NOT
 so men choose what makes them the most money while women choose what would help them help others neato,1,NOT
failing to account for gender hiring bias,1,NOT
i dont think women are complaining that the female regional manager for a mediumsized business is making less than the ceo of a major oil company i think theyre complaining that the same female manager is making less than the male regional manager at the same company to do the same job also a chemical engineering degree is only high paying if you find a job so its pretty telling that you chose list the ratio of those enrolled in the program rather than the ones actually employed in a related field,1,NOT
i just agreed with a prageru video when is the sky gonna fall,1,NOT
is there a gender earning gap yes is there a gender wage gap  no companies have a legal requirement to maximise their profit for their shareholders therefore according to the wage gap proponents any company employing men is breaking the law by not reducing its labour costs and maximising it profit i look forward to shareholders suing the ceos and directors,1,NOT
take that dumb english teacher,2,NOT
ive actually seen recordings of feminists saying that its wrong to pay women less just because of their choices and working hours d,2,NOT
wut bout non carrer jobs like fast foodretail jobs,1,NOT
title there is no gender pay gap video ok there is a gender pay gap but its only  cents thats not a big deal,1,NOT
you might be right put that waythe narrower gap makes sense but lets not pretend that some of those choices arent influenced by some social cultural and religious beliefs that tend to favor men,1,NOT
and to top this video off in  the equal pay act occurred making it illegal to pay a gender less because of their gender but the left wing retards still choose to ignore this,3,NOT
so to summarize women make choices to get paid less while men make choices that pay them more so women should go make better choices what do you think would happen if you take the same top  professions and compare avg salary between men and women instead of generalizing that women make choices that pay less and could you not use sexist variables like men are more willing to work more than women that is sexist and a generalization,1,NOT
this dumb cunts who claim the wage gap are the very same who look for a man to maintain them financially instead of work themselves,3,NOT
listen mate while the wage gap might not be  cents to the dollar which is actually the stats for white women only women of color earn even less it is still real there have been countless studies by universities such as harvard and oxford that show that for almost identical jobs for people in similar situations women are paid significantly less businesses dont hire all women because studies show that business owners tend to prefer male workers even if the woman is just as qualified or even better if you guys want to believe this its because youve believed it all along and like hearing your opinion voiced with facts which in itself is fine because everyone does but the thing is that facts are not things to be believed they are things to be understood this woman obviously has done well enough or is ignorant enough to not have experienced the need for feminism but that doesnt mean we disregard facts her presentation is obviously meant to be persuasive not informative which of course effects how the whole thing should be viewed im not trying to start anything and if you want to stick to your opinions fine but dont spew this out as fact because it has statistical evidence because that hurts the livelihoods of most working women,1,NOT
the people who disliked are radical feminists,2,NOT
to all of the people who call prager u propaganda stop you dont know what propaganda even is seriously though propaganda is misleading material created to decieve people prager u openly acknowledges that they have a very conservative bias so it would be grossly inappropriate to call them propaganda,1,NOT
how many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb    none because they think the world revolves around them,2,NOT
im interested in using this videos script for a school speech meet is that cool or is there legal stuff,1,NOT
thanks today i need to debate with my feminist teacher about the wage gap and how it is not what she thinks,2,NOT
fake information just conservative bs,2,NOT
the hollywood wage gap is touted as being the most exemplary but every actress whos complained about earning less has always been on set for less time and wasnt a star role or a crowd draw their arguments dont hold water at all and when you point it out all they can say is that youre a sexist,2,NOT
great video and you absolutely destroyed the retarded feminists out there,3,NOT
if a woman makes  cents for every dollar a man makes it would be too unfair because the man is only left with  cents,1,NOT
if i had a dollar for every gender there was id have ,2,NOT
dont forget though the common response to lower wages being on account of a persons choice is that women arent really free to choose what they want like men are,1,NOT
this isnt sexism its common sense ground shakes as feminists march towards us with antimisogynist posters,2,NOT
i got a prageru ad on a prageru video xd,1,NOT
k dislikes are from libtards,3,NOT
really great video quick thought i feel like to voice a right wing opinion to the left we must use a member of a minority to make the statements lest they write the opinions off by calling said speaker a racist or sexist for instance to speak out against feminism it must be a woman or the points will be written of on the basis that the person speaking is a sexist also for a right wing opinion on race to be discussed it must be a nonwhite person doing the discussion to avoid the points being ignored because the person making them is perceived as a racist just an observation,1,NOT
k feminists watched this video and downvoted,2,NOT
she uses median when she means mean im amazed this error made it through editing,1,NOT
her eyes stared into my soul,1,NOT
how to actually end the wage gap stop pretending to be a victim by it go for a stemlaw related major or high demanding trade and promote organizations to help change young girls mind who want to or interested in from the stereotypical jobs for women,1,NOT
the ratio of women to men in my mechanical engineering class was  dont get me wrong that one girl could put most of us to shame she was a very hard worker but that ratio is still insane with that said it was the opposite ratio for people taking nursing its just the way it is people have free choice they choose,1,NOT
they also dont count industries where women make more per hour than men,1,NOT
i wish people could just get along and have decent conversations feminists or not trying to one up each other and prove each other wrong will get us no where,1,NOT
what about the women who work the same amount of time at the same job providing the same services as their fellow male colleagues and still get paid less i dont understand how that would be based on choice or effort its also not myth or fake news correct me if im wrong but the market is still sexist,1,NOT
i bet u that everyone who disliked this video is a feminist,1,NOT
why are there k dislikes people should like the truth backed by stats and logic more than a narrative right,1,NOT
why are so many employers joining in on this movement is it just pr,1,NOT
los polticos como pedro snchez quedan como autnticos subnormales cuando hablan de la brecha salarial,1,NOT
wish i could see some feminist commenting ,2,NOT
people on the left pushing the wage gap are trying to make the point that if a man and a woman are working the same job that due to sexism companies and corporations will pay the women  less than men correct i have  points a who are the companies doing this where are the whistleblowers how could any company get away with a policy like this in  and keep everyone silent men and women b for every job you found where men and women were making the same money in the same position for hours worked etc you would have to find another where the woman was making  less than the man in the same position for hours worked to get  right,1,NOT
im glad that prageru is sane and against feminazis,2,NOT
good video however i will not change my mind based on a five minute video i will delve deeper into this idea,1,NOT
get a better job thats why,2,NOT
and i read asian women make more than white men because of choices,1,NOT
why do women choose such horribly paying occupationsstrange,2,NOT
its embarassing that we actually have to make videos like these its so basic and logical why would you only look at the factor gender when analyzing complex things its so obvious,1,NOT
this video is right,1,NOT
of course she said it in a more proficient way then i would but i could make the same point there is no such thing as gender inequality,2,NOT
how do i marry this woman,1,NOT
yes everything you said is completely true they high paying jobs are dominated by males and that is the point ask yourself why isnt that men are more like to choose to become an engineer then a women and as a women in engineering i will tell you that it is because from day one women face more challenges in the technical world then men do society systematically guides men to the fields of high paying jobs and women to the low paying jobs girls grow up being told to play with dolls and makeup while guys get building blocks and kinects i know there is way more to this then that basic example but you get the idea this systematic sexism is what the  cents on a  movement is about,1,NOT
i am so thankful that she is telling the feminists that there incompitant trend followers,2,NOT
and dont start with the male rugby players get paid more than females when was the last time you watched a female sport,1,NOT
my professor is teaching us about the wage gap in my college course i wanted to know the truth instead so i did my own research thanks prager i appreciate the sources as well ,2,NOT
normies i use centerlink,2,NOT
 the actual wage gap shrinks to only  cents or there is no gender wage gap pick one,1,NOT
how does this video have k dislikes its literally  supported by facts and research papers,1,NOT
i am here to read the comment section ,1,NOT
this is a great video good arguments however you didnt take into account other places in the world in easter europe where i live this wage gap is real there is still a lot of people in management places who hire women instead of men for this exact reason they give them less in fact they are going to do the same job but man wouldnt accept this instead a more defenseless woman can be taken advantage of i am willing to believe that in the us and westerneurope its negligible but in the eastern europe and other underdeveloped countries its a real problem,1,NOT
  and   do that math feminism,2,NOT
so women making less for the same job boils down to choices yet boys getting worse grades in the same class amounts to a rigged system you had a good point until you didnt,2,NOT
got blocked by a feminist for debunking them oh dear,2,NOT
you guys rock ,1,NOT
lmao a woman who doesnt know how research is done shares her opinion calling it fact,2,NOT
its a shame that the people who need to hear this the most wont theyd rather perpetuate hate and ignorance than to actually solve anything,2,NOT
there should be a gender pay gap women suck as workers if there werent laws against gender discrimination i think a lot of employers wouldnt hire them men do all the hard work while the women socialize with their obnoxious coworker friends and barely break a sweat anyone who has worked a job that requires manual labor has observed this they get paid for doing barely anything they are the laziest workers a man could do their  hours of work in one hour paying a woman who barely does shit the same as a man who does all the work is not reasonable,3,NOT
we call this brazil,1,NOT
this just proved how much jobs related to education are bad paid however this video is quite interesting,1,NOT
youre a sellout how dare you be rational and tell the truth she hates women shame shame shame shame facts get in the way of our sjw cause so shut up unless your yelling in an irrational emotionally erratic state of whipped up madness,2,NOT
on her closing sentence she looked and sounded very confused why didnt they reshoot,1,NOT
yes there is,1,NOT
bruh there is no wage gap the only  gap  there is is the iq gap between normal people and feminists because they cant even do math right,2,NOT
is this god,1,NOT
the wages are always payed per hour so this whole women work less has no significance in this debate the point is you should pay women and men equal amounts per  hour for performing on the same tasks with same responsabilities its that simple so many of these arguments are complete nonsense extreme feminism is very damaging i agree but so is this wisely covered up antifeminism,1,NOT
the people who push the wage gap are also the same people who say they are democratic socialists who are in essence communists,2,NOT
think this vid misses a huge aspect of the gender pay gap  little girls are taught to dress in pink and love unicorns and princessesthen they grow up and are expected to have babies stem subjects arent sexy  no wonder they dont choose them the issue with the pay gap is not just a  of money difference  its a cultural difference and stems from how we raise our girls versus boys,1,NOT
try working at the same place for  years and having a man make the same amount as you day  same education same position and same company this is the story of my mother she worked in the same factory since she was  its because of unions you know organizations that are supposed to protect workers just not the ones that actually work,1,NOT
if the uswn soccer team were men they would make millions i am a  yr old boy and enjoy watching them more than the men because of their pure undramatized and relevant talent and philanthropy,1,NOT
looking forward to linking this to some people,1,NOT
ok this does make sense but what about the so called glass ceiling is that a myth too,1,NOT
the job should have a salary  and that should be paid to the person that taking the job it should not have any thing to do with the sex of the person taking the job  it must have been an idiot that came up with one salary for a women and another for a man companies using this idea must have lost millions over the years lol make any wonder a lot of companies go bust if they let the sex of a candidate for the job decide the salary what a screwed up world,1,NOT
the  thousand ppl that disliked this vid are women,2,NOT
why do those on the right hate the idea of equal rights that includes hating feminism there is a gender wage gap even this video has to admit it,1,NOT
show this to every feminist you know,2,NOT
i posted this video as a comment on a facebook news post about the wage gap and i got locked out of my account for  weeks,1,NOT
i found out about the gender wage gap when i heard bernie sanders harping about how awful the situation had become for women i went to his website to read up on the topic i found only bullet points so i was forced to do my own research to see how such an injustice had continued to occur it took me about  minutes to find out that bernie sanders was a socialist windbag who cared more about votes than doing what was right any politician any politician who tries to use this bs wage gap number to push their agenda should be bound gagged and flogged were talking about national policy and the highest political offices in our country there is no place for this kind of bs when something so important is at stake,2,NOT
what is this doing as the add before my video triggered,1,NOT
ok the wage gap is about here let me give my own experience i am a receptionistaccounting ap jack of all trades at my office i started at  every single other person at my office starts off at  even the person who is a floor sweep all men except me i have education experience  much more ive been there for  years and still havent made it to  thats the wage gap right there,1,NOT
brilliant absolutely brilliant thank you christina for everything you do,1,NOT
you know i would hazard a guess that the reason women take lower paying jobs and work shorter less consistent hours is because of the social pressure and gender roles that dictate that they should females are encouraged to take lower paying professions because those professions are often more traditionally feminine typically female dominated areas will probably seem safer for women to take and typically male dominated areas will seem safer for men to take women may work fewer hours because they are expected to care for any children children they are expected to have,1,NOT
im so happy to see another woman talking about this i dont know any body else who has the same opinion as me great work ,1,NOT
so maybe the question is why are those majors predominantly male or female im not debating that the facts are wrong but how does this pattern come about that males have the highest paying majors on lock down and females have the lowestgranted by choice but why did they choose that,1,NOT
every one needs to see this,1,NOT
guys this video is true to a point please watch the vlogbrothers they are more specific and are probably true just watch all the perspective,1,NOT
i love prageru,1,NOT
prager u is gay,1,NOT
lots of these facts are actually outdated the top  best paying job statistics was from  years ago whilst the  worst was  years ago during this  year gap colleges have progressively invited more female students into colleges and some of the best fulfilling colleges dont accept women as often even today also you account womens maternity leave yet not a mans so that the gap seems closer i think both the extremist feminists and conservatives are both fabricating statistics the gap is more like  cents and there needs to be something done about it in an equality based manner,1,NOT
came here to see flame wars in the comments,1,NOT
i tried to bring these points up apparently statistics and logic are sexist,1,NOT
how could anyone possible dislike this video by disliking it they are actively disliking and ignoring facts which is a very dangerous thing indeed,1,NOT
why is it only white black and latino women seems like indian and asian women have it sorted out all computer sciencedoctor,2,NOT
if the difference is largely due to individual choice then i want to know why do women choose jobs that pay less or why does society think women should do these jobs also it is not entirely the choice of a person whether or not they get the job,1,NOT
 people didnt watch the video feminists  extremists,2,NOT
its funny to think about that when people arent killing each other in war they occupy their minds with this sort of thing like the wage gap isnt that big of a deal at all ill explain why i said that later the only reason this is going on is that in the modern world we lack the stimuli from tragedic events we as a species are used to so we have to come up with our own and im not saying that women arent discriminated at all but so many people misses to understand the fact that things have never been better its naive to say that the patriarchy is behind all of this when in fact in the last decades we have been moving so much forward in this field it isnt as simple as to just move forward from the way of thinking that men are superior because in the past that was true due to physical attributes that were necessary ie hunting and warfare the way of life we have now is so small portion of the human history that its almost idiotic to say that women have it bad so my point is that it is important to drive equality forward but please understand that it isnt an overnight thing but hey what do i know im a straight white male from a country that was one of the first to give women right to vote and has already had a female president,1,NOT
love you based mom,1,NOT
stupid women who cant even do simple math bark about wage gap that is nonexistent ,3,NOT
if theres no wage gap then why does my girlfriend make more than me haha checkmate prager ,1,NOT
because if they hired only women it would be unlawful discrimination you are coming out the box all kinds of wrong for thinking all of us are that unlearned not to recognize that error first and foremost since you are coming out the box like that it negates the rest of video thumbs down,2,NOT
capitalism is a fancy and more acceptable way of slavery multiculturalism is a an acceptable and less violent way of genocide,2,NOT
plus we gotta buy dinner,1,NOT
this video needs to be shown to someone who thinks the gender wage gap is real,1,NOT
this is exactly what i support equalism not feminazism,2,NOT
and citing the top  bottom  paying jobs as proof totally ignores how these studies are done ill bet the woman hosting this video got paid less than the male actors in their other videos lol,1,NOT
and i just got an ad saying women were paid  less than men wow g o o d j o b y o u t u b e   ,1,NOT
why should i an apprentice mechanic make less than a brain surgeon we both work we both deserve more money,1,NOT
thanks for telling the truth in a simple and intelligente way,1,NOT
is it possible for youtube comments to be constructive instead of pure hate speech an openminded person will not insult others but discuss and improve,1,NOT
this is so accurate that is offensive lmao,1,NOT
now lets talk about the percentage of women who gain child custody over their male counterparts oh we dont talk about that because it works in the females favour substantially,2,NOT
everyone listen to jackb  most womens lifetime priorities are for the sustaining and nurturing of future generations  ie their children grandchildren etc which exacts a toll in time and strength being a working mom is such a pressure that most the wiser women would choose jobs that would not interfere that much with their maternal activities and routines thus less work time done more time for the young uns and the husbandlover to boot hehehehehehehe i mean that gap is not even that bad youre right its just the effect of the priorities that women have visavis that of men kudos,2,NOT
very good arguments but when i first heard this myth i did my own research and found that there is a different sized wage gap for every single job out there and that something like  of those is where women are the bigger earners so i think my arguments deviate somewhat from sommerss arguments but they still argue against the same lie,1,NOT
can i get a citation for some of the stuff about men being more willing to work more,1,NOT
this is old news but stupid liberals will ignore it anyways,2,NOT
jordan peterson a famous clinical psycologist who recentlty went viral if you dont know who that is talked about how the small singledigit difference extremely likely has to do with how women statistically tend to be less assertive and more agreeable which consequently results in slightly lower wages and a decrease in raises,1,NOT
the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum  even encourage the more critical and dissident views that gives people the sense that theres free thinking going on while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate noam chomsky,1,NOT
this is so perfect you the woman talking are a smart person no one ever takes factors into account and boom theres the answer im saying anyone who thinks this is bull has no common sense end of story,2,NOT
this is unbelieveble i cant be more amazed how every video you make is wrong every one of them when you talk about socialism youre actually explaining populism and dictorship when you talk about how beutiful capitilism is you dont take consideration of the effects that companys have on the majority of the population lives and now you try to make the obvius gap a myth i beg you to stop this propaganda and always start youre videos with the frase this is my opinion if you think your giving valuable info to the population youre absolutly wrong and if you have any second interests you should be ashamed of yourselves stop using this chanel as an true documentery information and make it an opinion one because you clearly have the  of your concepts difinitions absolutly wrong i have no political party and i have wacthed severel videos so i have an objective point of view so dont even try puting me names or cualifyng me as something im not,2,NOT
sidenote i love that the title is there is no gender wage gap and to prove that point they helpfully included a study that found that there is a gender wage gap its just really small top marks ,1,NOT
men are expected to be the bread winner theyre expected to work hard and always earn more money get more promotions etc etc women arent expected to work therefor when they do work they arent expected to work harder and they like men get paid for what they do meaning they get paid less,2,NOT
i think the wage comes in the form of pay for different works womens work fields we know women typically occupy are paid less than fields where men make up the bulk,1,NOT
b a s e d m o m,1,NOT
i appreciate your efforts but the butthurt feminists dont believe in facts,2,NOT
are there any videos responding to this with counter info,1,NOT
one huge thing that the video missed was that women take off time from work when they have children in some cases women take off as much as  or  years from their career studies show women end up going back into different career fields or different companies and basically starting all over after having a child what must that do to their professional development and potential to earn any feminist who demands a woman get paid the same as a man after she is taking years off of professional development and work is being extremely sexist themselves if you work harder and longer you deserve more,2,NOT
now i know yall a bunch of bs rightwinger bullshitters shame on calling yaself a university,3,NOT
the leftist need their head examined,2,NOT
nice math but average is not median,1,NOT
this video is a life saver i got bullied by my history teacher over the pay gap ,1,NOT
aauw clearly states that  is aggregate number and has followup breakdowns by profession education etc prageru decided just repeat single number and waste time on what everybody who reads more then title already knows,1,NOT
funny thing hiring only women would destroy your company,3,NOT
men need more calories on average so they need more money for food a basic need this is justified because the work they do requires more calories on average so there should be a certain wage gap between men and women but there isnt one,2,NOT
so many triggers in the comments,2,NOT
men on average earn more than women especially mothers stop shaming women professionals and saying they are less driven its societys construct that prevents mothers from free daycare maternity leave and a reasonable schedule is demanded by both mean and women,1,NOT
 k dumb feminists disliked this,3,NOT
youtube is putting an error occurred on this video before the video plays so people think the video is not available and will bail on it before getting to actually see it this is a purposeful act on youtubes part,1,NOT
they cant call it mansplaining now,2,NOT
i think this myth is actually starting to dissipate at least in sweden most feminist most are actually quite reasonable over here,2,NOT
that like to dislike ratio proves that quite some salty feminists watched this,2,NOT
to be fair the vast majority of men who studies theology is working to become a catholic priest i can only assume the women want to become nuns i dont know what you get out of the job except a christian job,1,NOT
i loved how christina hoffsummers talked to triggleypuff as an unruly child,1,NOT
let me guess the koch brothers are somehow behind this website,1,NOT
this shuts down literally anything that those stupid western feminists and celebrities say,3,NOT
i loved the  best paying sectors and  least paying sectors part just proves that people want to be paid more for being lazy,1,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense that is all folks,1,NOT
i like you lady,1,NOT
vlog brothers made a better video on this topic covering the area in a broader sense,1,NOT
if it were a male explaining this it would have a lot more dislikes,2,NOT
ok people just because this video debunks the gender pay gap doesnt mean you can attack feminists,1,NOT
thank you so much for finally debunking this lie to death,2,NOT
well it is true women get paid the same but why is the unemployment line in my area  male and why is it that businesses are refusing to hire a male who meets the qualifications that the employer is asking for and instead hiring a female right out of high school who does not meet the requirements also why is it that the average female here has as many as  jobs when the male can not even find one no matter how hard they look the answer because business are being required to hire a female over a male and oh yea lets not forget the homelessness ratio which happens to be yea you guessed it  male why because they can not get jobs,2,NOT
a lot of this has to do with society stereotypes that are ingrained in us as children there is still sexism at play,1,NOT
we need more people like her,1,NOT
i never really bought the whole gender wage gap as a real thing but i didnt exactly know how to actually argue what i thought but this video really made some great argument points thanks christina  prager u ,1,NOT
suck it feminazis,3,NOT
wait didnt you guys already make this exact video i remember that there was a video on the wage gap by prageru,1,NOT
this video is great,1,NOT
i am applying to a job but i checked to see what it paid first the problem is that it says compensation is  hourly but is that the male or female wage why do companies only post one wage like this and not even specify what sex it applies to,1,NOT
i love this channel and seeing the ignorant thumbs downs lol,2,NOT
the greatest thing about this is that a woman is speaking and has sources from a feminist organization the key piece missing here is that the smaller percentage of women being hired in stem fields science technology engineering and math are actually paid more than men due to corporate demographic quotas so though women may be under represented in those fields by choice it is actually discriminatory towards men in the aspect of payroll savethemales,2,NOT
as a conservative this is the best feel good video for me,1,NOT
so the point of the video is saying that there is no wage gap by explaining why there is a wage gap,1,NOT
uber did a study on this too they found the exact same percentage gap existed but not because women were paid less if anything uber is renowned for its equalityfocused business model instead women were more willing to work more flexible hours stayed in the uber system for less time and werent as competitive as men with regard to where the best spots were the wage gap existed primarily due to experience behind the wheel in the uber system where men spent longer hours and were more driven pun intended to earn the most out of their position they deduced women had more obligations such as family than men and are more open to reviewing their choices by transferring from one job to the next men on the other hand are willing to find the most profitable position and stick with it regardless of how it goes it reveals the key psychological differences between men and women seem to reflect their earnings,1,NOT
wow great video,1,NOT
edit i dont believe a wage gap exists i am a statistician this video undermines itself by stating there are so many variables that drive wages that no single study can cover all of them well a single one or the variable hasnt been found to title there is no gender wage gap then say  or   wage gap exists then there you go youve agreed it had been found and it exists a woman can get cervical cancer because only a woman has a cervix since wage is nonbiological we need to find the social determinant of the  also why not post all sources in the description i was super excited for this video now its easily dismissed as propaganda anyway i have to go buy a nintendo switch with my  larger mathematics major salary,1,NOT
if u disliked ur a fat slag and u think u know everything when u dont,5,ABU
showing this to the students in my class who still think the wage gap is real even after i explained what the wage gap myth was based on but they didnt understand because theyre stupid ,2,NOT
after this speech i wouldnt mind her earning more than me at the same job modest women need to be rewarded i mean this conceptually not literally,2,NOT
th like ,1,NOT
right im done with feminists who wants to be a maninist,2,NOT
from  women financial independence was like   in  years from  to  every  rich men there are  women rich so you cant deny that fact the modernisation helpd women to get in entrepreneur world in east women work in technology in building structure in eary tough jobs like men fao said  of poor people not children not men not old people theyre women fao un also confirmed  of worker in clothing factory farming land recycling technology or garbage are women so stop laying pride kills your manhood and your humanity im bank manager my salry is k a year but my male friends in the same job with the same degree with same year experience he make k a year i cant respect you if you dont respect my rights flapping that as if world against you and give you half what i get or imagine if you been a women come on be a fair,1,NOT
ladies take it from a man you aint breaking a glass ceiling youre breaking a glass coffin youre bringing yourselves down into the shitty jobs stay up there if you value your sanitation,2,NOT
why does this video have  dislikes i thought this video was a good one and educational,1,NOT
if gender does not exist how does the gender wage gap exist,1,NOT
queen of telling the truth,1,NOT
no one will ever listen milton freidman was preaching this back in the s and no one cared then feminists dont care now,2,NOT
did you notice that the reasons you mentioned for men receive more work longer hours willing to relocate available at any time are directly associated with sexism once women take more of the unpaid work as cleaning and child care they cant be working lower hours,1,NOT
whats sad is it doesnt matter how many times we explain this the idiots who believe women are paid less will ignore the facts,2,NOT
sounds like a more realistic reason then just sexism like the left says it is,2,NOT
he raped me using logic to debunk my victim complex,2,NOT
i take me as an example  i moved  times to another city  gave up my social environment and got huge raises in exchange i make round about twice as much as i would if i stayed in the region where i started working the willingness to do this is far higher amongst men than women,1,NOT
o brasil agradece pela traduo para o nosso idioma,1,NOT
video title  durz no wayj gap content in video  there is a small  gap left,1,NOT
and that is a badass,1,NOT
 feminist dont like de video ,2,NOT
rather than focusing on the wage gap we should encourage women to take choices that they want to teach them that just becuase they dont see loads of women in technology they cant be part of this in the end career choices change a lot,1,NOT
how is this so hard for the public to realize there is no wage gap nobody in there right mind would pay others less or more based on their gender the only gap would be based on there physical and or mental capabilities but there is no gap in reality it is a factor on a few different things that cause the wage gap it is the fact that women end up not choosing fields that earn them as much for an obvious example there are many more male doctors than female and on the other side there are many more female nurses than male nurses they both are in the same field but there is a clear difference on what they end up choosing also if you ask a lot of girls on what they want to be ones that choose medical fields end up saying i want to be a nurse much more than i want to be a doctor that is the equivalent of somebody saying that they want to be a copilot maybe that comparison was different but there is an obvious correlation in all fields with this just like you will see a lot more hostess at restaurant than hosts female  hostess another besides that is the effort it would take for females to do certain tasks such as heavy lifting ones or dirty ones clearly men go into that field because they are genetically by far better and they would need  or more women to complete a task than  man for most cases i can go on with a lot of details but the last would be things like maternity leave causing them to literally miss work for months because they had a child which is understandable but if you want that to be on your options you need to take less pay or you just dont get paid leave,2,NOT
thank you most big channels wouldnt do this because of the hate it is good for there to be people doing something to set the record straight instead of to look good,1,NOT
i love this video i love the speaker i love it all,1,NOT
where can i find a woman like this but like  years younger,1,NOT
humans should burn,3,NOT
part of it is what others think of other workers inside and outside the job parents friends  its the culture what george soros and the globalists want you to believe is whats on tv women pretending to be smarter and stronger than men this report proves women are weaker in every way haha ,3,NOT
things not addressed that would be helpful for further research are there simply fewer women in the highest paying fields or do these fields pay more because they are male dominated in cases of change where more men go into traditionallyfemale fields such as teaching and nursing does this drive up wages across the board or just for male employees do both genders really have the same access to all professional fields or do recruiting hiring and training processes seem to favor one gender over another in certain fields ie is it a matter of simple choice or are our choices curated before they get to us how have increasing trends in women working in higher skilled educated fields impacted wages overall ie is there any evidence that wages go down in a field when more women enter it what differences in socialization based on gender impact things like negotiating wage applying for jobs which you dont necessarily have all the qualifications for etc,1,NOT
the title of the video does not fit the conclusion of the video which argues that there is a gender wage gap but it is smaller than the c in the dollar commonly reported,1,NOT
well theres  feminist that disliked this video,2,NOT
finally something i can agree to with pragru,1,NOT
omg your a gurl and you defending the horrific mysogonistic excuse my spelling privileged males you disgust me,3,NOT
the best part is this is talked about by a women,1,NOT
just to quote the source where did she get the precentages for the jobs,1,NOT
and lefties still claim theres a wage gap,2,NOT
finnaly a women that is not a feminist,2,NOT
the swedish goverment is also spreading this lie,2,NOT
the gender wage gap by definition simply looks only at the average median earnings of both sexes therefore this video subconsciously agrees that it exists it simply misunderstood the definition as men getting paid more for equal work which rarely happens in developed countries,1,NOT
gender wage gap is they basically woman more money for doing less,2,NOT
if most woman do work which is supposed to be less paying and the gap is only  cents and there are way less full day working woman than men woman are actually earning way more than men ever can men to fight for fair pay,2,NOT
i bet the patriarchy made those women choose a lower paying job,1,NOT
our lord and savior,1,NOT
im only on here because im in school and we have a sub,1,NOT
this is the best add i have ever seen on youtube,1,NOT
so when you account for different choices men and women make it becomes  cents so what about those  cents whats the explanation for that,1,NOT
why are women so butthurt men are expected to pay for everything anyways,2,NOT
there is a gap there is inequality but the cause is not what anybody thinks the cause is central banks like the fed the sad thing is most people dont have any clue what a central bank is anymore or more important how it really works,1,NOT
thank christ the person in this vid was a a women or else feminists would just say hes lying lol,2,NOT
from my understanding of this video its the fact that women are expected to have worst paying jobs and are expected to be home more,1,NOT
how does this video not have  million disslikes lmao this is genius,1,NOT
thank you for this,1,NOT
even though i do lean left its pretty obvious the wag gap is bs then again feminism as a whole is bs,2,NOT
thomas sowell said it already since the s,1,NOT
i love how they got a women to do this its so much more convincing take that feminists,2,NOT
because gender studies is the rightful path to gain a lot of income,2,NOT
hahahaha is this video serious,1,NOT
prager university had a woman narrate this and probably quite a few writeproduce it as well and theres still  thousand uninformed sjws that downvoted this video because of the title,2,NOT
someone should run a business but they hire all men for yrs then hire all woman for yrs just to prove a point,2,NOT
there is still a problem women still staying at home taking care of the kids because the majority of men refuse to that makes quite a portion of women in marriage leave their jobs and not make any money it affects statistics it doesnt mean that women are paid less just like you said but it is still sexism another problem may be the way we are socialized a study shows that women in general have way less selfesteem than men this influences career chooses while men tend to go for a harder degree women with the same grades go for a easier one that happens because men usually overrate their capabilities while women do the opposite that kind of justifies the fact that there are so many men studying engeneering and so many women at magistrate degrees another fact is that wherever there is a space with a high proportion of male presence that space is masculinified and it pushes away many women from taking a step an being part of it at last but not least there are some studies which show that women tend to choose careers in relation to caring of others like pedagogy related degrees or healthcare and those of course are not tastes we are born with there are a whole lot of psychology studies that show us the evidence about that i say that as a psychologist well i think i left a lot of room for yall to think some of these thoughts of mine are only hypothesis but im pretty sure that they will turn out to be true if somebody makes a research,1,NOT
i wish this mentioned the fact that women also disproportionately care for children an average of almost  of their careers since its easy to see how women would make almost  cents on the dollar less,1,NOT
woww i never knew this i was a bigger believer in the gender wage gap  but prageru has opened up mind eyes god bless prageru,1,NOT
debunk the race pay gap,2,NOT
i find it interesting that the career paths presented as being dominated by females are industries predominately in the oversight and regulation of government not saying that the government doesnt have its hands in all of the mentioned industries just observing that the most government interaction is obvious in the female dominated industries,1,NOT
her voice is so soft and sweet ,1,NOT
so do we not still see an issue with the fact that every discrepancy is chalked up to choice its not that hard to imagine that there are social pressures at play for men to occupy certain jobs and women to occupy certain jobs,1,NOT
to be honest it depends some firms are in fact being sexist and paying men more than women but in the general  cents idea that some people have what she says in the video is largely true although i dont think gender matters in whos willing to work more because i believe in equal opportunities since gender equality cannot and shouldnt be achieved i think men and women are human and they both can do the same things depends on how much work they put into it,1,NOT
excellent finally the truth,1,NOT
thank you this has always been my thinking,1,NOT
i agree with this all the way but how come us womens soccer gets watched more than us mens soccer but gets paid less,1,NOT
wage gap intensifies,2,NOT
thanks for sharing your research,1,NOT
if a woman got  cents to a mans  then why dont buisnesses hire only women it would be  cheaper in terms of wage excuse me i have to go educate some people,2,NOT
its being said by a woman therefore it must be true,1,NOT
wait your argument is that there cant be a pay gap because if there were companies would only hire women lol,1,NOT
this video makes a lot of sense to me however how do you respond to a feminists counter that women are conditioned and socially gendered ie oppressed to choose the less highpaying careers eg girls growing up play house growing up taking care of dolls and etc  nurturing jobs or motherhood in other words a feminist would say that women do not have free choice because of societys conditioning how do you disprove that,1,NOT
i feel like an important choice this video skirts around is the choice to be a mother we as a country dont have laws protecting maternity rights also clarification i am not a feminist i find the idea degrading and counterintuitive i am however a deontologist who values all people,1,NOT
feminists sees video comments well obviously she is just a fake women and is a man in disguise,2,NOT
yes there is,1,NOT
another thing that you notice about feminists is that they often have this toxicity and hostility in debates as soon as you disagree with something they say and counter it with facts youre just an offended and insecure and most importantly mansplaining broflake or something like that basically all the time when a dude disagrees with something a feminist says he is instantly met with ad hominem attacks or other forms of highly arrogant and almost narcissistic answers i cant recall a feminist that actually started to engage in a discussion in which heshe actually replied to my comments it basically always follows this scheme  initial comment based on perceived truths  countering that statement with actual facts  ad hominem attacks and bringing up more unproven claims while ignoring the facts from the first answer  countering the new claims with facts as well  fleeing into conspiracy like excuses example well the patriarchy raises us like that when you showcase how the pay gap is a result from individual choices and further ignoring the stated facts or simply claiming they are wrong without providing facts and evidence to support the claim that the aforementioned facts are really wrong,3,NOT
 simple enough men chose a job that pays better so all the sudden women get discriminized because they made a bad choice,2,NOT
could you believe my mom makes less money than justin bieber absolutely disgusting sexism,2,NOT
no no dont tell the truth it does not fit into the rhetoric and the agenda of neofeminists dont do it,2,NOT
ok so it is a pay gap not a wage gap this is still a problem,1,NOT
im showing feminists this video,2,NOT
i love you based mom,1,NOT
k dislikes from people who cant handle the truth,2,NOT
i learn this from maddox years ago but glad to see it getting out there,1,NOT
id like to think all this is true can someone please give me some sources for the facts here because prageru have a fairly horrendous reputation for simply appealing to their audience over giving the complete accurate story case and point their video on carbon dioxide which was painfully inaccurate,1,NOT
thank you lol,1,NOT
the right wing bias and lies on this channel man hahahah,2,NOT
they used to pay married men more than single men and paid women less than that since they thought women would marry and raise a family and leave company,1,NOT
great video keep it up,1,NOT
wow much respect for your decision to make this an advertisement on youtube takes some guts to spread the message and open yourself to feminist hate take my like if it means anything,2,NOT
i got an ad for you on the video,1,NOT
whats surprising is that you guys never made a video on this before,1,NOT
to be fair there are misogynist people in some positions of power who tend to not promote women as readily not employ them or discriminate against them in other ways it really does happen and its not a thing that should happen and this could explain parts of a wage gap however most people arent like that and you dont tackle an issue effectively by exaggerating it to the point of absurdity and thus ruining your credibility in the public eye like most feminists these days do,2,NOT
middle class white woman are one of the most privileged groups in human history be grateful that youre not expected to do work,2,NOT
im pretty sure that if a women picks a dollar up off the ground that its actually only worth  cents while if it were a man it would be a whole dollar as such i found myself in a particular issue when my  year set of twins  male  female brought up the wage gap difference to fix this i found that the average  tooth fairy gift per tooth would be balanced by my daughter being provided more coins to equal the values they are both super happy that i had talked to the tooth fairy for them the tooth fairy tends to leave a little extra though providing the  for my daughter while this is a little more than the proper balance of money from the wage gap which my son isnt too okay with i see no problems with it when they get older and i have to pay them to clean their rooms ill probably end up doing the same thing as the tooth fairy that way everything is fair,2,NOT
can this be required viewing for every dopey idiot that went on strike yesterday and attended the womens march,2,NOT
also im pregnant so i dont want to work a lot so im mad because im not making as much as my male coworkers because they are still working  hours instead of my sad  hours i need the same pay amount as they do even though i work less thats what you dumb ass women sound like  use your brains not your gender to be logical,3,NOT
may i have the sources pls i need to do more research on this,1,NOT
god i love this video,1,NOT
the  dislikes are all women xd no offense to anyone its just a joke,2,NOT
there is solid evidence wage gaps between men and women exist i wrote a thesis for school on it,1,NOT
is this for america or the world,1,NOT
there is no war in ba sing se,1,NOT
id like to take this one step further and question why female dominated college majors dont pay off i mean were talking early childhood education psychology community organization and social work these things are unarguably important and no less essential to a functioning society than petroleum engineering so why does so little money flow there making the jobs even more unattractive than they already are the way different working fields are rewarded directly reflects on what values a society holds and while economic interests may be a justification its surely not an ethical one sorry for any grammar errors not a native speaker,1,NOT
women deserve nothing,5,ABU
isnt it interesting when you point out that a a social ill is not actually a problem the response is yes it is instead of oh great im so glad thats not really happening its almost as if some people want things to be going poorly,2,NOT
i am ashamed of cousins and certain aunts and uncles who think that there is gender discrimination in payment really ashamed they unfortunately follow the herd mentality,2,NOT
wow prager did a video that has sound research am i in an alternative universe,1,NOT
next thing you know feminists will start saying that women arent being let into higher paying jobs as much,2,NOT
but but muh wage gap,2,NOT
ooooooohhhh some marxist tushies getting chapped here,2,NOT
while this is all true it doesnt question why jobs that are primarily male occupied are paid more than jobs that are female occupied why are teachers paid less than say advertisers because this is capitalism and your value is determined by your contribution to the flow of money out of consumers pockets into the hands of the top  if you can make money for the biggest companies that are all controlled by just a few hundred people either by creating a product marketing that product through the media or by being an influential actor or athlete or by altering the publics view of your company in a positive way then you will be rewarded with a big paycheck many govt jobs are male dominated as well but why dont women gravitate to these higher paying jobs as often as men because of gender roles instilled in us since birth men are told at an early age to be tough not show emotion be confident and that their worth is determined by their personal drive to succeed and be the breadwinner woman are told either directly or indirectly through the media to be nurturing respectful not be too loud or else be called bossy or a bitch and that their appearance is what matters some of these things are less extreme than in past years and more women are entering stem fields but turn on a tv and its clear they are still common tropes society shapes who we become and the choices we make and its clear that white men are in the highest positions of power in this country and decide what we see and hear in our daily lives why would they not push messages that keep them in power just look at trump and his rich white male cabinet another thing to consider is that when women do end up in male dominated fields such as the oil business they are often harrassed and considered inadequate for the job this video also ignores the study that found when two identical resumes are submitted to employers with the names john smith or jane smith john gets hired more often this video is too simple for such a complex problem,1,NOT
i totally  agree however i would like to see some sources,1,NOT
this is definitely a group of trump supporters,1,NOT
based mom has once again blessed us with her infinite wisdom,1,NOT
feminism is cancer,3,NOT
go ahead and shit on me but early childhood education shouldnt require a degree to me please prove me wrong did you not learn everything you needed to besides problem solving from the core  ,1,NOT
most people dont work fields they got a degree in though i would say a great many men work construction which doesnt necessarily require advanced education and gives by for the most hours worked on a job,1,NOT
these radical feminists dont understand how math works how economy works,2,NOT
this is one of the best things that ever appeared in my recommend sub earned,1,NOT
just because a wage gap isnt necessarily  the cause of employers intentionally saying to themselves i think ill pay x group less doesnt mean that wage gap is automatically innocent or rather that only the portion which we can directly connect to an explicit intent to discriminate as the cause of the gap is problematic andor unfair andor discriminatory as the narrator herself points outthere are many possible explanations including factors influencing these choices men and women make as if choices have ever occurred in a vacuum free of human or natural influences on ones considerations ones socalled free choice it is still entirely possible that the difference in career choices and educational opportunities can be explained less by womens willingness to accept lower compensating fields of work but instead the tendency of the whole society many of those women included yes to segregate andor selfsegregate women in to particular kinds of work and roles that may or may not be paid or paid as much as roles society at least much of society historically has preferred to push men towards and women away from as much as possiblewith varying degrees of explicitness,1,NOT
the most common sense explanation i have come across we have the same problem in the uk media and politicians perpetuating the myth that women are paid less than men for doing the same job i dont get why they want to portray women as victims,2,NOT
examples that cant suit every case of inequality you gather different studies to make them saying something that is accorded to your thoughts and so many people do not see that apparently this is the lack of criticism in your minds just a guess ,1,NOT
love it your someone who spreads the truth,1,NOT
a womans work is never done and that explains the wage gap,3,NOT
god bless you womanyou speak the truth,1,NOT
i agree with you but why dont you provide your sources it would help in spreading the truth you can find a plethora of falsehoods for any given perpetrated lie however its only getting harder to find hard statistical data,1,NOT
first you talk about full time jobs and then yous name one of the things that they dont take into account is hours per week i agree with your point i just find it disapointing that something like this is in here,2,NOT
it is true that women are less likely to choose stem fields but there is a reason for this women are less encouraged to choose these higher paying jobs since their early life they life society discourages them and burdens them with stereotypes therefore they dont choose higher paying jobs because they think men will do better,1,NOT
i dont know what to believe anymore,1,NOT
i work at a pizza ranch this is just how it happens to be but every shift lead and manager is a woman including the owner also most of the women get paid more than i do there,1,NOT
she says choices create the difference not the wage gap but arent choices created by the gap in education in the fact that women are often forced to work in lesspaid sectors that women more often take care of children and thus spend less time at work this gap is not a myth,1,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense will be the best quote in this video,1,NOT
common sense logic how dare you bring this blasphemy upon us there is no such thing,2,NOT
liberals will say shes racist xenophobic homophobic islamophobic transphobic woman hater and that will be their whole argument,3,NOT
according to the broadcast why is womens soccer so white one of the main reasons for it is that that these youth players are preferring to play for clubs rather than just to play high school soccer they see the need to play for clubs because since the womens soccer is not as major as for the mens soccer team despite of how well they perform as compared to the men it was mentioned that some clubs were as high as  per teenage girl when we compare national team clubs to high school soccer it is notable that not everyone will have that type of money to pay for their girls to go off to play it all has to do with socioeconomic and the parents who have this type of money due to their higher incomes are white thus this is one big reason why there is so little diversity in the womens soccer team shifting to the video there is no gender gap the overall message is that there is only a  wage gap and not more as others make it seem they mention how basically it is the womens fault because of their career options which impacts how much money they make however what they dont realize is that out of all the job options they have there is only  of jobs that pay women and men equal so how are they expected to choose wisely when there is hardly any options for them to choose from it is sad to see how even with the same education the gap still remains just because women are seen as less reliant because they are not able to work at all times due to motherhood and all the other household responsibilities women have on top of work they mention how it is not sexism but all of the previous states otherwise how men are more capable of doing certain jobs and they are less of a burden for employers moreover according to adams et al of section  classism womens average pay is at  of mens compensation throughout their whole career women only make  of what men make it was mentioned in the reading how discrimination is part of it but also because women are not always able to work the full time and thus if you need to be absent for a period of time from work it is a stiff penalty in declining their career and slashing the pay the lack of daycare and flexible job options makes it really hard for a woman to work the same amount of hours as a man overall i think it is important to analyze this further and note how it is not that they are not telling us the truth or they are doing bad math they are sharing the actual facts and truth on what women have to deal with,1,NOT
i make youtube videos why dont i make the same as pewdiepie wtf youtube,1,NOT
im a retired history teacher when we covered the modern feminist movement i would debunk the wage gap for my students later in the course i would have them pick a social issue facing women today describe the problem and propose a solution a significant percentage of them generally around  would write their paper on the wage gap,1,NOT
my teacher is trying to force us students that there is a wage gap and im afraid to send him this video,2,NOT
must not confuse and upset lefties with factstruth its bigoted and hateful,2,NOT
i too concluded this itd not only be ridicilous but a violation of human rights i mean come on telling a female engineer gone through the same studies alright this guy is going to earn k bucks but were only giving you k thats ridicilous,1,NOT
hope that every sexist or feminists can finally use their brains or common sense after watching this,2,NOT

so your justification for this makes me trans yeah  no no just no you can be a tom boy get on better with men especially gay men you can support the lgbtq community i have always been a supporteradvocate for lgbtq but doesnt make me trans i dont always wear make up or glam this doesnt make me trans people are really struggling for acceptance and with their own identity because they identify as trans  seriously people who are trans are struggling and fighting to be treated equally in the workplace and not be discriminated against in their place of work as we speak please stop jumping to conclusions you have not researched properly becuase of you have more masculine energy,3,NOT
so like im attracted to gay guys so that makes me a trans gay guy,5,ABU

for goodness sake all this talk about gender and whatnot there are masculine females and feminine males that does not mean that they are a different gender your gender is what you were born with period idc if anyone else says they identify as this or that your sexuality is a different story but im sorry genders are not changeable i am a female and i am way more masculine than most boys that i know and i have always felt boyish since i was young but nonetheless i know that i am a female people are making everything such a big deal and confusing everything,6,ABU
just because you dont like girly things doesnt mean youre trans just because you didnt like grown men staring at your boobs doest mean youre trans just because you dont like a role of women and want to be the man and the assertive one doesnt mean youre trans its okay to not conform to gender roles and still identify as your birthsex it really seem like everyone be forgetting that,3,NOT
usually im not the type to gatekeep but honestly knowing trisha this is the biggest insult to the trans community if this is a joke its offensive she either wants attention or is confused is she really trying to convince us she has gender dysphoria ,3,NOT
are you stupid or just fucking dumb,7,ABU
oh girl you need help so confused,3,NOT
so do u identity as she,3,NOT
imagine out clowning pennywise lmao honestly trish i expected so much better from you you lose not only a subscriber but a genuine fan transgaydragetc isnt a choice its something youre born as and find out later on in life the fact that you actually think that because you dont wear makeup you have a masculine personality you go after gay guys makes you a trans man is honestly so disrespectful please realize you need help and get it youre  years old so please act like it,2,NOT

plz get educated girl this is gross if you were actually trans i would be supportive but this video is not what it means to be trans just because you like being around dudes doesnt mean youre trans youre mocking the trans community and fetishizing gay men this is very stereotypical and just over outward images its not what it means to be trans not wearing makeup doesnt make you trans being attracted to gay men isnt trans thats just a fetish admiring girls doesnt make you trans being glam doesnt make you trans youre not trans just because you think it would be easier to be a man youre not trans simply for feeling masculine also theythem has nothing to do with multiple personalities when using i in literature it can be used for one person when the gender is unknown so theythem can easily be used for someone who doesnt go by shehe its also offensive to say female energy comes with someone thats not it yes misogyny forces us to feel the need to dress up but not worrying ab that stuff does not mean youre a dude please do research get a therapist to talk through this because this hurts you clearly dont know what these things actually mean you need to think this through thoroughly and figure out what youre actually saying ill respect your pronouns but trust you need to get your head on right to know for sure what youre talking about hormones and surgical transitions are serious they arent just a little nose job you cant go back from them it is offensive you are confused you are not basically a drag queen first of all  drag is an art drag is not trans drag is not day to day life youre not a drag queen sweets learn these terms babes,2,NOT

great i just happened to watch vegan  this morning ive been a vegan for precisely  days which is how long its been since i watched what the health on netflix these movies can turn people because for so many of us we somehow remained in the dark on these truths so powerful they can be instantly lifechanging once we realize eating animal products is actually bad for us and we dont need to do it then we no longer need to accept consuming animal products no matter what the rationalization in which case we can see it for what it is its a complete paradigm shift because most of us have always believed we needed to consume animal products in which case thats just the way things are turns out we dont live in a dogeatdog universe but a pandaeatbamboo universe,1,NOT
this is awesome,2,NOT
i do love that household chores are listed but yard work isnt how about auto maintenance building projects diy chores im a stay at home dad and my wife still does way more household chores than i do but its not because shes oppressed but because she is willing to clean the whole house if i do the bathroom cleaning the bathroom sucks and it gross but it takes me like an hour a week so i just do it its the same deal with mowing the lawn ive never brought up doing it to her other than to make the point about what i do around the house because i like doing it i take a great deal of pride in my yard but when it comes to cleaning out the dog kennel bernese mountain dog bernese cross two boston terriers and i run a doggy daycare that sucks but it still needs to be done again it buys me a lot of chore credit so i accept it and just do it the problem with assessing peoples personal choices at home is the lack of context my wife would love to stay home clean the house and take care of children but she got a really good job that turned into a great career and its not cost effective if women arent on your equality bandwagon thats fine its time you stop worrying about such stupid things,3,NOT
ok guys in traditional households earn more because they work more than women if women wanted to be a sole provider and the man to be the child caretaker that could work but since this is traditional thats how we get the average,2,NOT

one piece of data that i would really like to see is some measure of the actual productivity vs wage gap thing that might be hard to get for some fields but for others like sales or something there ought to be a straightforward way to get actual productivity metrics to compare in order to defeatconfirm the theory that the wage gap is actually due to a performance gap,3,NOT
if ppl could get away with paying women less then they would just hire women,3,NOT

aaaaand yet again a clearly feminist outlet obscures some important facts one men are expected to earn as much as possible to be viable partners two working longer hours equates to job experience three child rearing and household duties require availability and men being expected to earn the bulk of the household income directly negates that four  percent of unsheltered homeless are men five more than  percent of workplace morbiditiesfatalities are men six men on average work an extra  to  hours a week seven millenial women are outearning their male peers its interesting that people that clutch the wage gap so close to their heart never address these issues,3,NOT

still there is no assesement about how being a woman makes it harder to work on particular hours from this video it feels like an assumption or stereotype still vox great as always,3,NOT
relatively close to zero is still not zero and still unjust,3,NOT
women earn less but they choose to emeurhasflskafd yeah ive heard this argument before doesnt really matter though im not going to complain that women are choosing to earn less than what they could have,2,NOT
the wage gap has been illegal for over  years what youre talking about is an earnings gap which is made primarily of the choices of the women since the majority of women work less bourse than men,3,NOT
the wage gap gets smaller and smaller the older they get almost like the wage gap has been about completely removed from existence in ,2,NOT
guys you really didnt get the video its mostly saying that the wage gap isnt real or at least something not to complain about because it makes sense how do you people get the idea that this is a feminist video,2,NOT
remember if companies pay women less they would prefer women more it would mean money for the company,2,NOT
equal work um no in most jobs men perform better thats the reason for the wage gap,3,NOT
this video shouldve gone into more detail the analysis was pretty shallow,3,NOT
when i saw the title what people miss about the gender wage gap i thought it would talk about how blatantly the wage gap is calculated by just dividing the average earning of a male by the average earning of the counterpart female but nooo this video along with certain feminists yes not all feminists are alike just like how all muslims arent terrorists politicians and celebrities completely ignore the fact that some women choose different careers and work hours hey by the way the number of employed men that are alive should also different from the number of existing employed women well thats just a hunch and im  so judge what you will furthermore just for a second lets assume that the wage gap is in fact real and women get paid c for every dollar a male makes that said why for what reason dont all companies hire only women since it is c cheaper than hiring a male dont companies want the most bang for their buck and not spend more money than they have to this would save tens of thousands maybe millions of dollars every year if their workforce only was comprised of women well who knows anyways i am not trying to diss women here please that is not the message i am trying to get across if that is how you feel i apologize moreover i do concede that women do work less than men in most cases due to their schedule and that is what this video talks about and that is what we should be worrying about and for that reason i did not dislike the video but nor did i give it a thumbs up so fighting to get rid of the stereotypical notion that women should be at home solely responsible for the kids is the real war we should be fighting and we are we are progressing but we are obviously not there yet and everyone should be contributing this also isnt just about women but everything that concerns another humans well being paraphrased from mlk so there isnt anything wrong about a feminist or any advocate for that matter as long as you are well educated so what im trying to say is earning does not equal wage cookiopuss ps youtuber neither is the earth flat and thanks for reading all of this if you did,3,NOT
male logic translation women make choices that affect their income negatively while men do whatever it takes to clime the corporate ladder the wage gap is a myth here is proof if you are a ceo and you can hire women at  cents on the hour to the dollar an hour a man works for the same output in labor who will you hire if you want to get rich the answer will always be the woman since she is cheaper labor that is simple economics folks the reason that woman are not dominating the workforce because of this logical choice is because they make decisions that adversely affect their work performance taking time off to raise kids and inflexible schedules is bad for business so you make less for those reasons ladies no man is oppressing you you did it to yourselves so maybe quit blaming your bad choices on men ok also just so we are clear paying a woman less for the same work is discrimination and there are laws against it since you never hear of women winning lawsuits then these companies obviously are not in violation of said law so your wage gap argument is invalid,3,NOT
once i went to my wifes work and sat in her chair for one hour waiting for her meeting to finish so i could take her for lunchfor that one hour she made  more money your welcome honey,3,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap that it doesnt exist,3,NOT
this is why we need bernie sanders,3,NOT
soooooo you debunk the wage gap right away then go on to say we need to force equality of median values between full working people regardless of education and job expertiese this is why everyone hates you,3,NOT
poorly done analysis proves just about nothing,3,NOT
wage gap doesnt exist never did it is nothing more than a feminist conspiracy theory aka feminist theory for short,3,NOT
amazing how so many kids who are whining about feminists in the comments didnt even manage to understand the video vox didnt say that the wage gap was nonexistent they explained why it exists and what needs to be done to tackle it,2,NOT
the gender pay gap is a strategy to pit working women against working men  divide and conquer and the top  laughs all the way to the bank,3,NOT
its easy for a woman to earn as much as the men in her field she just has to work as hard and as many hours as them and deliver the same results in most cases to achieve and sustain this may imply not having children,3,NOT
id love to hear how hours worked skew this data,3,NOT
am to  pm  am to pm it still  hour how is it any longer you get paid by the hour if you dont work  hour you dont get payed for your  hours simple math and looking at what women made in the  is not now it is  there are laws that keed this gap of your from being truthful you need to go back to school i think you missed something like logic,3,NOT
so the message here is that guys are lazy yeah ill believe that,3,NOT
from most studies ive read through the data seems to always point towards childbirth most women have to take quite a few weeks off because of this phenomena so when they return their income tends to lessen compared to if they didnt therefore one of the easier ways to end the wage gap is to give paid family leave to the mothers and fathers so the wages dont decrease upon the parents return to work this will also add a much healthier relationship between fathers and their children and take the edge off of the average working class wife who has to return to their job after giving birth to realize her salary has just dropped compared to their coworkers,1,NOT
i once worked as a punch press operator for about  months the guy before me got his hand shredded in one of the machines i saw the pictures and i was surprised that the doctors were able to put it together at all the job was  hours a day  or  days a week to have enough time to make food in the morning and get to work on time i woke up at  am there was only one woman that i ever saw there and she came in about once a week to help with accounting,1,NOT
paygap isnt real btw,2,NOT
heres an idea maybe we shouldnt care so much about how much men vs women make and just encourage everyone to pursue the job they want so long as men and women are both paid on merit rather than gender then the pay gap wont matter,1,NOT
as long as you make me a sandwich,2,NOT
you wanna hear a joke wage gap is a thing,2,NOT
wait one year out of business school were these people working at the same facility or were they employed by two different companies who pay differently and is it possible that the men strived for higher paying jobs to better support a family hmm i wonder why these studies are so inaccurate also if employers could get away with paying employees less why wouldnt every company hire woman,1,NOT
lasted  seconds most annoying voice eveeeeeeerrrrrrrr,2,NOT
great video i just wonder why sarah kliff said that the finding of claudia goldin  is really cute,1,NOT
it has to do with life choice its not les per hr its less per year ie less work put in per year,1,NOT
nice vid vox is usually kinda bad at this sort of stuff so what we learned the wage gap is a non issue and personal choice is the reason for it,1,NOT
it shows how much they make a year not how much they work my wife make  more a hr then me but i made k more then she did,1,NOT
earnings gap not wage gap earning key words here vox,1,NOT
men have testosterone which makes then more aggressive this means that in the business world especially they will fight more for a better position,1,NOT
look if you wanna earn as much as or more than men work as many hours work jobs with the same payment and dont take more vacations simple,1,NOT
why the dislikes are people denying the wage gap again,1,NOT
im sorry but this video is misleading it does however kind of show how even with years of data and statistics you can manipulate the truth,1,NOT
why do you talk like thaaat,1,NOT
you will close the wage gap between genders to  if you are as productive as men,1,NOT
urban legend  men work more hours end of debate ,1,NOT
women work part time a lot and the people that do these statistics count them as working in the same place but dishonestly do not include hours worked because that would destroy there pay gap narrative cooking the books one might say,1,NOT
im a business owner in it  communications field i would love to pay less to my employees and hire them all women if i could pay them less but women employees are the worst ones to be on call they usually will not bother staying the th hour to finish a project i even have written complaints from the female employees themselves about  hours overtime im not sure what do i not see plus women really dont know how to negotiate for the salary just saying,1,NOT
if a girl wants to make as much money as a guy she should put in the effort to get the same education and job,2,NOT
im willing to bet that vox chose a study that focused on highincome earners because at lowincome brackets there is almost no wage gap,2,NOT
women dont work overtime equally with men,2,NOT
nice femenist video on something that does not exist,2,NOT
if these feminists want equality then why dont these feminists get mad about how women almost always win custody cases,2,NOT
kids ruin everything but thanks for getting into the nuance of the issue,2,NOT
so were just going to ignore the fact that men work longer than women work harder jobs than women and are more likely to ask for raises and promotions,1,NOT
not to mention the rate of dangerous work spaces and work fatalities for men compared to women is much higher,1,NOT
k bigots disliked this video,3,NOT
insert wall of text trying to disprove the wage gap even though the video does it,2,NOT
basically this relies on  reasons women dont ask for promotion women work fewer hours women prefer different jobs,1,NOT
men must be doing better work otherwise who would hire a man for higher pay if the outcome is the same logic is logical,2,NOT
feminists cant complain on this video,1,NOT
i dont see anything wrong with this video edit the circumstances of which this video is complaining about or inciting should change the reasons for the pay gap make sense and in a capitalist society especially in business economies which are driven by competition men seem more capable to meet the demand made by those companies that are competing with other companies hence there are more men in these economies than women and the men achieve higher and better paying positions because they have the damn time to its not like a woman cant achieve fair pay i think we are doing better than ever by far when it comes to equality of opportunity but how does it make sense to alter the function of a business in a competition based economy just to fit a post modernist perspective of egalitarianism why should the outcome be equal if the factors arent,1,NOT
needless to say that more flexible hours are awesome for everyone not just ppl with children,1,NOT
great content vox keep it up i like where this channel is going no bullshit facts and stats,1,NOT
definition of wage income received by employees usually headed on actual work done men work alit more than women usually and are nine times more likely to die in work than women less work  less money,1,NOT
do people not get it is illegal to actually pay someone less for the same job in the us people actually think women get paid less hourly in the same job opposed to men,1,NOT
men work harder,2,NOT
thomas sowell debunked this a long time ago lol,1,NOT
so much bullshit in this video who falls for this crap hey vox why not use facts and be truthful for once oh yeah doesnt fit the agenda,2,NOT
so you have to somehow make companies and corporations to change their work ethic for women to shrink the pay gap the median shows that there are less woman making high wages compared to men and vox even admits that having kids greatly effects it having kids is a choice isnt itneeding flexible hours to accommodate taking care of your kid was a thing that happened to choice why must we actively try to change the wage gap if it doesnt even determine how successful a woman can be a solution could be to have more woman that dont have kids and dedicate lots of their time to work the wage gap is essentially not even oppressive but rather showing of how family systems tend to work it all comes down to whether or not you will settle down for a family or continuously put your knife to the grindstone,1,NOT
wow great video this time vox glad you stopped being cancer ,2,NOT
prager u did a good video about this a little biased but good facts some of the same things said,1,NOT
great video vox whenever i watch one of your vids i always learn something new,1,NOT
im also interested in how race plays into this  i read from a few sources that latina and black women make much less than asian and white women but that was a long time ago,2,NOT
i dont even need to read these comments to know they will be full of fuckboys,2,NOT
flexible nonstandard hours are better across the board as a consumercustomer i dont want to have to do things during business hours i want to be able to go for a routine doctors appointment at pm on a thursday night or call my realtor and go tour houses at am on a monday or go out clubbing on a sunday morning doing stuff at set timesdayshours is stupid,2,NOT
i was expecting bullshit propaganda good on you vox,2,NOT
wage gap isnt even real,1,NOT
wait no they earned  less k to k not  unless you mean  the amount that men make,1,NOT
her vocal fry is extremely annoying,2,NOT
feminist men get paid more then women me wow the world one make belief,2,NOT
can we like this so we let vox know we like when they make factual videos,1,NOT
the wage gap is shrinking as women are having kids at an older age because honestly looking after kids can be very full on  it can be hard work but women should be allowed to choose to have kids without getting fire from angry people,1,NOT
i dont think people realise that its tough on women because they want more help with looking after kids and its tough on men who want to spend more time with their kids thanks society ,1,NOT
my mother earns  less than every man in her bureau even tho shes  and has way more experience she works as an architect so she could even do the work at home and it is completely normal that she earns  less,1,NOT
wow vox used full data sets for once good for them for real good for them,1,NOT
its an awesome video  and we should really work on this to make peoples lives better i just want to put something out there there is no wage gap inside the same company for the same position its always about the average of different companies and different jobs but yeah still we should do our best to make things better ,1,NOT
well at least this was far better than the proposals from general feminists,2,NOT
another choice communism,2,NOT
wage gap doesnt exist,1,NOT
wait so vox is uploading this but continues to upload ish bit contradicting,2,NOT
wages and earnings are not the same thing men and women have the same wages there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap because men do make more money only because they choose to do more difficult jobs and do more overtime and work more hours and take less breaksdays off and ask for raises more often women dont make as much money because they are not hard workers it has nothing to do with muh patriarchy,1,NOT
this video sucked,2,NOT
got to say it is funny how these studies only look at less common and higher paying jobs i would love to see data from more common job sectors,2,NOT
that it aint real end of video,1,NOT
women are not as good as men at the highly technical and engineering related roles that generally pay the most for most people the reason why they are not as good is probably because they are not as intereseted in those roles for all sorts of biological reaons even though most women who enter those roles then enter management or quit as opposed to most men who stay motivated on the technical side less women as a whole enter management because of the starting numbers so the gender pay gap is not a gender gap but a talent gap people who take career breaks for family reasons who are not as nerdyautistic and as a result achieve less and have less experience in short they are less valuable in the business world and thus are paid less people who are aggressive obsessed about their career position thick skinned enjoy being manipulative with borderline socipathic tendancies do well in powerful very high paying life dominating management positons can those traits be attributed to gender,1,NOT
is this a valley girl accent,1,NOT
theirs no wage gap,1,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap it doesnt exist,2,NOT
how to get rich as a woman study why men are richer than women inb triggered jokes m,2,NOT
why are you surpressing your voice at the end of almost every sentence its kind of annoying,2,NOT
yes what people arent told is that the wage gap doesnt exist its a income gap,1,NOT
so basically the summary of this video is that wage gap exists because women work fewer hours with less paid time periods because they have children and because they tend to gravitate toward jobs with lower pay in other words men dont earn more because they are men but because they work more,1,NOT
women take on a disproportionate share of childrearing tasks including pregnancy,1,NOT
i think that we have finally gotten to a point where a person man or woman can become whatever theyd like to be,1,NOT
its simple women dont wanna work jobs like engineers and lawyers i go to an engineering school and the ratio is about  percent guys and  percent girls but when you look at the engineering classes the ratio is about  to  in favor of men,1,NOT
women should get paid equally to men when they decide to work as hard as men annoyed ladies well blame yourselves and start working harder instead of spending your working time gossiping like whs,2,NOT
im glad and kinda surprised you didnt immediately jump to sexism as the primary explanation refreshing,1,NOT
curious to know if the study showing the shrinking gender wage gap in older women took into account women who left the work force to raise their children and never made it back in,1,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap the gap i guess there isnt one how could there be every company would either be in court all the time or would only employ women since they are cheaper this wage gap bullshit is feminist translation sexist propaganda,2,NOT
women get to spend more time with their family they have better lives men work themselves literally to death is our goal to work more or spend time with family forget wage or earning gap and lets look at quality of life gap,1,NOT
did vox just admit that the wage gap exists due to the choices of women and not sexist discrimination do they realize that this means the wage gap is a non issue,1,NOT
she keeps switching from median salary to average salary which im guessing is to the benefit of her argument,1,NOT
we dont have a gender pay gap we have a gender wage gap when we say that there is no pay gap that means that in the united states men and women are paid the same for instance if theyre getting offered a job as a starting position at mcdonalds or a teacher at a public school its illegal to discriminate on the basis of race gender or any other condition men and women are being paid the same in all hourly paid jobs but how much many men and women choose to work and how they work is the difference aside from women not even participating in certain strenuous industries like construction or landscaping where a lot of physical labor is required and there is a lot of money to be made women are also not keen to do jobs that are highpaying and heavy in mathematics and sciences as proved by college degree acquisitions modern women have had access to college for decades now and women are now the majority in college participation in the united states and yet women still steer clear from math and science degrees the women are choosing that nobody is stopping women from getting that boring math calculus or rocket science class these disparities are more than enough to account for the difference in how much the average woman and man earns in america now specifically to this video the most important issue is female psychology the idea that women dont want to work in general many women may value their alone time and prefer to have down time they may not want to work as many hours as men do not just for children but for their own personal development i know that not all women fit this archetype in fact the hardest working person i knew that used to work everyday two jobs was a woman so there certainly are busybee women out there thats not most women though most women dont want to be workaholics and more men are prone to being workaholics what i think is interesting is that even in this video we see this aspect of women wanting to avoid work playing out in this video we see how the way to improve things would be to make things more flexible and that men should do more housework in other words this video is pandering to the people who want things to be made easier for them make things easier on me its too hard to work  hours a day make it  hours and give us more vacation and more money this is exactly the attitude that im talking about when i say that many men and women simply dont want to work or are always looking to push their work away a true mother wouldnt bemoan all the hours she spends caring for her children a person that loves to work wouldnt be thinking about when the next time they get off is gonna come were talking about different psychologies here this isnt even to do with women or men because ive seen hardworking individuals on both sides and people who prefer doing recreational activities who are both males and females its just that our culture happens to promote female recreational attitudes a bit more the reality is under a free market the hardworking people are going to outcompete and outclass the people who want more recreation in general thats the trade off that people who want more free time must make more free time equals less money under equal circumstances this video makes it look as if wanting free time or wanting more recreation is even desirable do you realize there are workaholics who never take any vacations and who never even have a day off and still have time to take care of their multiple kids let alone  or  kids that the average female worker has let the workers work let the market give the job to the men and women who actually want to work without complaining,1,NOT
does vox pay their employees equally,1,NOT
what the hell man you cant state its factually correct then give the reasons why it not women of the world mainly first world stop with your victim complex its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,1,NOT
way to go vox way to be unbiased,2,NOT
yes there is a gender wage gap but its simply because men choose different types of careers women generally choose lesser paying jobs its that simple also men usually work longer or take fewer vacations,1,NOT
lies gender equality is already a thing propaganda,2,NOT
oh no you guys women are only earning two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year whatever will these businesswomen and scientists do i swear between this and jennifer lawrence complaining about her pay this looks like an exclusive problem of the rich the rest of humanity all have job titles and somewhere in hr there is a big chart that says what each job title gets per hour,2,NOT
never watch video go on to posting opinion about the wage gaps existence,2,NOT
wtf k usd per year whaat,1,NOT
ok so it seems that since woman choose to take on more extra responsibilities that they dont have to take on they cant work as much getting less pay fair,1,NOT
in short the wage gap is women making the decision to work less and shock getting paid less as a result,1,NOT
vox is wage the rate which employees are paid per time givenproject ex hr project or is it the accumulated money earned with a specific range of time ex yearly monthly as for the pew research about share of house work did it account if the mother and father both working full time have equal or close earning potential if a father who earns  in a year while the mother earns  in a year wouldnt it be logical if the mother bear the brunt of house hold chores while the father takes the opportunity to push his career for bigger paycheck i would say it is the first time i saw a study that tackles gender gap in careers and actually use appropriate data,1,NOT
this is intellectualized propaganda very cute,2,NOT
this girls vocal fry is really annoying,2,NOT
there is waaay more to it than even shown here basically the gender wage gap is not a myth its a damn lie,2,NOT
stop going into gender studies so you can get a job that actually matters,2,NOT
as a female i do notice a wage gap but for all i know its a result of the male wanting to negotiate more on salary and the companys health could also have played a role because he was hired later after about a year or two of working for the company another female was hired who made a little less than me and hadnt even finished her degree,1,NOT
if the wage gap was real then companies would fire all the men and hire women,1,NOT
wow vox you actually did research congrats,2,NOT
the wage gap is a lie,1,NOT
sounds like a personal problem to me,2,NOT
wage gap stats so you arent a subscriber to wage gap but that some discrimination may exist and that it can and will be dealt with in the courts right,2,NOT
imagine if vox was forced by law to not lie to the stupid women are paid the same as men for the same job,2,NOT
is vox saying the same thing that that kid from google said and wasnt he fired for saying it,2,NOT
while everyone else is arguing about the wage gap im sitting here wondering how graduates only  year out of business school are making between k  k on average,1,NOT
we need to show this to everyone and give this amazing woman an award for being so awesome,1,NOT
who else came here to just see the feminists comments,1,NOT
youll get paid the same if you do as good of a job,1,NOT
there is no wage gap it it proven that women take off more time and work less hours then men,1,NOT
at least somebody has made an effort to get the facts out stupid celebrities and their sheep,1,NOT
holly shit prager u seems to have gotten something right wow just wow of course they didnt get here through a critical analysis of evidence but rather because in this one case the evidence does not contradict their political narrative seeeerrriously can we dispense with fake universities now or should we elect another con artist president or two first,2,NOT
in a nutshell its a canadian women vs american man because american dollar canadian dollar,2,NOT
great video good explanation the left is not interested in facts at all,2,NOT
just wanted to know when  of  became  because im pretty sure that math just is not correct,1,NOT
 thats the stupidest chart ive ever seen,2,NOT
i can definitely show my respect to a well conducted actual research on the topic even if it comes from people with differing political opinions that kind of research is what has to be spread about all topics ideology should stop to be the main point of a party they should rather focus on facts and how to improve the situation using proved methods,1,NOT
do these statistics take into account the amount of work each gender does,1,NOT
in addition to making more flexible hours we should try to create a society where women and men are expected to take equal roles in child caring,1,NOT
my sister just got triggered when i showed this to her,2,NOT
surprised to hear that pay is based on ability to work and not sex,1,NOT
please watch the video before you disliking,1,NOT
last summer i worked as a waiter at a college one month i got paid  more than one of my counterparts who just happened to be a woman modern feminism would look at this and say that the college i worked for was sexist as me being a male earned more than my female counterpart what they would overlook is the fact that i worked more over time and didnt take any of my earned holiday and so was compensated for it at the end of the month i did this not because men work harder but because i had student debt to pay off in this case i was on the exact same salary about  an hour and was contracted for  hours a week this is a prime example of how the wages and earnings are two totally different things you can be on the same salary but have different incomes depending on holidays taken and overtime worked its a shame feminism has gotten caught up in this hysterical regressive liberal movement as feminism is one of the greatest triumphs of the th century,1,NOT
this seems a lot less opinionated then most of the facts i hear most other feminists rant about,1,NOT
you cant close the wage gap if you want to earn more as a woman dont have kids or make the man do more for your kid you must be a dumb ass not figure that one out dont use the wage gap as a thing for argument sort your own wages and get a union fuckface,1,NOT
we as women deserve more money we clearly are earning less than men and treated unfairly,1,NOT
considering that paying a women less because they are a woman is illegal the lack of lawsuits is selfevident to the existence of a wage gap,1,NOT
curious as to why this is such a huge issue youd have to look very to find any two groups who earn the same amount asian men make more than white men white women earn more than black women what is being about these differences what about the gaps between us citizens and german citizens why is one earning less it seems like one group is wanting special treatment,1,NOT
oh please world goverments internetional bodies like the un oecd world bank and imf and leading banks and financial institutions all confirm the wage gap is real economists who have spent their entire lives studying the way gap and know a hell alot more about it than a resident scholar of a rightwing think tank and edgy teens who have never worked a day in their life another ignorant video even the first argument why dont firms only hire women is a fallacy that totally ignores logistics demographics and skill levels not to mention the oecd found even factoring in work choices hours leave etc still leaves a nearly  wage gap and forget offthebooks gender discrimination opening your eyes to the obvious conservative agenda being forced here,1,NOT
if the wage gap were real business owners would hire a lot more women so they could cut their costs by paying them less this would increase the demand for cheap female workers and drive wages down for men who are trying to compete,1,NOT
  is not  less than  it is  of  but only  less still a large amount less but not as much as  less,1,NOT
i should be able to work  hour a week in an noncompetitive industry and get as much as tim cook all jobs are equal,1,NOT
so in other words the wage gap is an illusion,1,NOT
the liberals are mad,2,NOT
man i wish liberals would watch this they wouldnt have a response because the gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
seems like vox isnt liberally biased anymore ill subscribe again,1,NOT
somewhere in the world there is a buddhist who have finally attained true inner peace and has founded harmony and all answers to life just before he dies he leaves us with  vital piece of information and it is vox causes mentally retardation and with that he died with a smile on his face that is a  true and verified story by the new york post the washington post and the daily report and dont bother researching this either i did all the work for you just take the buddhist mans advice on vox  causing mental retardation,1,NOT
nice now instead of spending countless hours arguing i just send this video easy to understand excellently made and covers many many things thanks,1,NOT
i feel like everyone should watch this and then open their mouths to speak,1,NOT
this channel is the greatest thing ive ever seen,1,NOT
i guess im just lucky enough my parents taught me to value even the smallest amount of money even if there wasis a gender pay gap just be thankful you got paid at all p,1,NOT
why do women chose lower paying professions at a higher percentage than men,1,NOT
then theres the question on why womeon get the not as high paying jobs,1,NOT
the only reason feminists talk about the wage gap is because they just want higher pay,1,NOT
now we should ask ourselves why are women in less paid jobs and that is not only because of choise only a small fragment of ceos and other high managing positions are female while studies suggest that women in leading positions are often better suited for these than men for example it is very likely that the  bank chrash happened majorly only due to male hormones and that way to much risk taking while women prefer to play it safe so now why is there this difference in leading positions i can not imagine any other way but sexism,1,NOT
vox disproving the wage gap i cant believe it,1,NOT
i feel like theres a good argument here but it seems like theyre saying women make less than men for the same job unless i missed something i thought that was illegal,1,NOT
what people miss about the gender pay gap  it does not exist,1,NOT
love these women not cheap hole fem,2,NOT
is there any scientific proof for a correlation between the wage gap and the flexibility of the job,1,NOT
when vox makes a video about the wage gap but then gets hit with reality in the comments,2,NOT
 unexplained wage gap i have an explanation  to  percent of us companies are stuck in the dark ages just a thought,2,NOT
for every dollar a man makes a female makes  nickels,2,NOT
best political video from vox in a long time gg well played,2,NOT
im surprised theology and religious vocations is only  male theres no money in that field for women why would any woman choose that field ,1,NOT
the  cents on the dollar is not correct and tooken from a study that has a basis,1,NOT
dont forget women that choose career over family are more likely to be depressed,1,NOT
you are doing the work of god,1,NOT
can someone please correct me if im wrong so there is no such thing as a wage gap however there is an income gap and this is based on choice people make with women birthing babies and all mostly staying home or only working part time hence earning an income equal to c for ever male dollar and there is no job that a women actually gets paid less then a man for the same work just looking for some clarification is all,1,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap is that it doesnt exist,1,NOT
not perfect but good on you vox,1,NOT
mrs sommers is a legend,1,NOT
extreamlh important to hear it for a woman thank you,1,NOT
you need more infohours worked  the same position not just a doctor but what type of doctor etc,1,NOT
i used this video in my global perspectives class for high school as a counter to the arguments made by my teacher it was good to see some free thinking and fair debate,1,NOT
stop with the wage gap nonsense there will always be a gap between groups thats the real world,1,NOT
please dont listen to this its fake,2,NOT
however many likes this gets are the number of days i will go without masturbating,1,NOT
even if the wage gap did exist why would anyone want to be a feminist in todays age good and true feminism died in the s now feminism is about man hating egalitarianism is the way to go,2,NOT
respect the wamen,1,NOT
i love it when women are talking about how the wage gap is false these women are smart as hell and it just throws egg on the faces of these feminists,1,NOT
the wage gap is a myth,1,NOT
businesses would hire men for more money because their work is valued more its like hiring someone who is untrained just because they will take minimum wage instead of paying more for someone who is trained,1,NOT
somthing tells me vox doesnt factor in certain facts for certain reasons,2,NOT
warning might be trollz below,2,NOT
wait so the fact that women can have kids makes them less deserving of an equal wage,1,NOT
hmmm i like feminism makes entire video about false statistic,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist,1,NOT
i dont really believe gender wage gap is real never had a job with a girl that we both had the same job and we were paid different,1,NOT
is there any valid argument in existence that can actually prove there is a wage gap because from where im sitting grade  math where you learn meanmedian and mode can easily solve this myth why is this dead horse still being beat,2,NOT
well i was going to comment but the video was so badly researched it made me vomit,2,NOT
men are also more competitive and ask for more promotions and raises men work more hours than women overall,1,NOT
its not like women are statistically more educated,2,NOT
if i get hored at mcdonalds and a woman gets hired at mcdonalds for the same position we will both get payed minimum wage i dont see a wage gap there,1,NOT
dont listen brainwashed liberals,2,NOT
surprisingly unbiased video informative and factual good job vox,1,NOT
so what youre saying is that its not a wage gap but its because jobs dont have flexible hours good to know,1,NOT
what they miss about it is its nonexistence,2,NOT
i was shook i thought this was going to be a pandering video but it was actually factual,1,NOT
i cant even imagine how many triggered feminists fill the comments,2,NOT
the wage gap ended like  years ago if you see women making less it has nothing with gender or maybe its just the job,1,NOT
maybe women choose different life choices because men and women are different on average not because of sexism which is what the wage gap mythargument implies maybe women want to parent and care for the household more than men in general and men want to got out into the world and bring home sustainance more than women in general why should anyone care about closing the wage gap when their is merely a difference in choices not a difference in opportunities infact women are currently given far more opportunities than men and women overall still choose differently than how wage gap apologists want them to,1,NOT
what this means is that the wage gap is voluntary based on sick american female culture women choose a man and they decide how to spend hours so sick male culture gets involved too misogyny and misandry coexist and as a white male i feel demonized far more than i see women exploited since my birth in,1,NOT
this is one of the only vox videos i dont hate good job,1,NOT
the gender wage gap is bullshit,2,NOT
everyone that says oh if women are cheaper then why wont i hire a full women staff yall are the dumbest kids online if you watched the video you would learn that due to hours needed by a women in her s it would be seen as unprofitable for you to hire all female staff thats how american business calculates it between the potential maternity paid leave and hours a female employee might try to take of american business dont want female employees typically did you not pay attention to the whole video and i say american business because apparently we are the only country in the world that doesnt have by law paid maternity leave,1,NOT
feminist will now complain that they do more in the household nowgreat,2,NOT
are men usually expected to support the house more so than the woman is expected to include all factors please,1,NOT
not a complete lie but women cant expect to get the same amount of money after being knocked up and in maternity vacation for several months  or  times in their career,2,NOT
not shown in the video the ethnicity of women playing into it as well,1,NOT
the main argument here is that the wage gap exists because women do more housework and childcare duties therefore they cant focus on their careers as much as a man who does less childcare and housework the problem with this is that it assumes women are forced into this role by the patriarchy and they dont want to be the main childcare provider by their own choice which is largely not true of course there are individual situations where it may be the case that the man wants to do more or equal childcare to the woman and that couple is free to factor that into the way they situate their lives which im sure does happen already but by and large most women prefer to do more of the childcare and let the man do more of the breadwinning so they can spend their time with their child while theyre growing up and less slaving away at work while the child is with a someone else and both parents are doing this willingly as what they see as the best way to raise the child and of course no one wants to do housework generally speaking but whoever is home more will obviously be the one to do more housework in this case women are home more so they end up doing more im a woman in a thankfully childless relationship with a man and i make more and therefore he does more housework and takes care of the animals where as most of my coworkers who are nearly all female mothers prefer to work less and stay home with their kids like i described and i am an exception of sorts also the single mom issue is a totally separate situation that wasnt addressed in this video and i will say that they tend to be royally screwed because they cant focus all their time on children or on their careers which is why a free to hire government salary nanny would be a great thing to incorporate into the usa basing it off of how its done in france that way the single moms pay wouldnt go right back into baby sitting while theyre trying to make a profit on top of all their other bills and expenses that come with children,1,NOT
too bad it didnt mention a lot more nuances of the gap and still had the slightly sexist edge to it but whatevs,2,NOT
most of the money men make is spent on or by women anyway,3,NOT
im very tired as of now and what im getting out of this is that most women who are earning less are doing so because many of them have children to take care of so theyre missing hours the solution is that work hours could be made more flexible is that what shes saying here if so couldnt a better solution be to raise the wage of women with children who are singleunsupported please note that i am not very educated in this field so im just making a solution based on what ive observed from this video p,1,NOT
ima start a business of just women and pay women  less profits will be booming,2,NOT
inafter angry mostly white guys who are triggered by the idea that anyone other than them might actually enjoy less privilege and consideration than they do look angry altrighters and misogynists you dont need to give anything up by admitting that the tables are stacked in your favor it doesnt reflect poorly on you it simply means that like a rational person would you acknowledge that white dudes have an easier time of it than anyone else because historically thats been literally indisputably true im the child of two white lawyers who are very successful but guess what they recognize how advantaged they are and fight to end things like income inequality based on race and recognize that things like institutional racism are real things again you mustnt give up anything privelege race identity politics and basic human decency arent zero sum games,2,NOT
im a bit confused so the wage gap exists but is different in different job fields or does it not exist,1,NOT
look at all of the dislikes it is pathetic if you dont like facts you have no place here and no place in any discussion or debate,1,NOT
earning is the word you are looking for,1,NOT
 triggered femininsts who dont like facts disliked,2,NOT
a balanced video  people still offended,1,NOT
the gender wage gap does not take into consideration how many hours people work or what job they work,1,NOT
its weird that women are often penalized for getting pregnant its how the species continues folks,1,NOT
all these debates huge sums of invested money research companies fields of social sciences faculties on university and college campuses yet you can pretty much explain any gender debate in a free and civilized society with two words biological determinism boom done,1,NOT
i think what most are missing from this video is that the wage gap is inherently caused by culture and the disproportionate effect children have on women vs men the wage gap problem is an apples to oranges issue because its caused by forces primarily outside of the workplace but we see its effects as the average wages between men and women what vox is trying to say is that to fix this inequality we should approach it by giving women more opportunities to balance this extra demand placed on them or some how alleviate it through policy whether its better childcare maternity and paternity leave to allow the father more time to help or more flexible work hours its not about trying to pay women more to compensate but by giving them the tools to be on an equal footing which i think we can all agree with,1,NOT
why do you even care about the earnings gap what problem do you have with women making conscious choices to work part time raise kids take more sickvacation days etc dividing people into groups instead of treating everyone like an individual is what keeps us separated,1,NOT
so if you want to make more money dont have kids problem solved,1,NOT
people saying it doesnt exist are wrong it is definitely exaggerated though not to mention that all the statistics around this are outdated we should be looking at what women going in to the workforce right now can expect to make compared to their male peers in the same profession the fact that they were using people from different professions is ridiculous there are more women in universities today than men so it stands to reason eventually women will have a higher median income especially considering the lack of women in lower paying labor jobs but noone will say its sexist then,1,NOT
sorry but the wage gap doesnt exist,1,NOT
the gender pay gap is a myth simple as that,1,NOT
you cant lower something that does not exist,1,NOT
i figured it out how to get through to you take out the dangerous jobs nobody wants to do that men do that women dont then add all the job positions men and women do adding them all up to get  and  showing they make the same amount for the same jobs positions next show the dangerous choices of work that men do that women choose not to after you figure out it is the same pay it will show from mens choices of dangerous jobs that it adds up to  for men to who choose dangerous jobs women choose not to do leaving it out of the  equation let the  set off to the side by men choosing to do dangerous jobs women choose not to do by averages of pay do not add this to  because it is choices of work vs pay now wait for it,1,NOT
no matter what the gap still exists at some extent its still an issue just not nearly as bad as some people make it look,1,NOT
those who claim that the wage gap does depend on more factors then just gender btw i dont believe in the wage gap wil then say that there is still sexism because woman care for children and thus cant work first im sorry to be that guy but biology sort of decided that or god if u like fairytales because woman mentally and physically are better at child caring then men who are better at hard work and hunting for the family to survive and second i believe that just like here in europe families should get paid when a woman cant work so its still fair so when a child is born the man can work and woman gets some money but less and the company the woman works for doesnt have to pay the woman but gets a cut of the money that would go to the woman so the woman wont get fired and thus chaos within the household wont happen and a child can growup with the attention of a mother which it needs,1,NOT
   you dont say,1,NOT
its just biology having a kid is a choice a woman must make and yea there are consequences good and bad money isnt everything,1,NOT
vox just triggered many angry feminist,2,NOT
yea they miss the fact that its a myth,1,NOT
i work at a chili cheese hot dog stand in new york and everytime i earn a dollar my wife takes  cents,2,NOT
what i learned from this video go to business school,1,NOT
basically women make different life choices than men so they get less money makes sense nothing sexist about it just angry feminists that try to make more than they earn,1,NOT
 feminists possibly including men trying to get laid disliked this video,1,NOT
lol are you kidding if this is true why dont all business hire only women to save money,1,NOT
vox finally catching on to reality,1,NOT
wage gap does not exist,1,NOT
poor families are two income families while rich families are one income families where usually the man works  hours per week while the woman stays at home managing the household and thats mostly because those women want that if the relationship is new and the guy loses his job and cant find a good one and doesnt get a good income anymore theres a big chance she will find another boyfriend  thats how men are stimulated to put a lot of care into their career the same way that women are stimulated to put a lot of care into their looks what this means is that women from rich environments often choose not to work while poor women often dont have that choice and a result a larger percentage of working women come from poor environments that is the primary reason why men get payed more it has absolutely nothing to do with men having more chances the only places they might have more chances is in top business functions sports or acting or careers like that where salary is entirely arbitrary but this is only relevant to at most  of the population,1,NOT
thank you vox for helping the cause focus on the real problem its not that companies are flat out sexist and dont pay women the same pay its because of our culture and society and difference on personal preference i hope that this video will help the cause get back on track following the facts,1,NOT
sowhy didnt you include other factors such as  men on average work  hours more a week them women  men on average work more overtime or stay late  men take less time off  men are much more likely to ask for a promotionraise also i like how you kinda glossed over the fact that women get pregnantbut ya thats a thing a pretty major one at that,1,NOT
atleast in sweden the real wage gap just taking gender discrimination in to account is about   which is bad but not the  wich many sjvs say,1,NOT
if a woman works just as much as her husband and is still doing mostall of the housework then its on her to tell her husband that she needs more help from him that sounds like a relationship issue not a pay gap issue,1,NOT
stupid feminist pigs,3,NOT
bless this video,1,NOT
are we talking pay before deductions or after this is just as important as the rest of it,1,NOT
when a woman has a child she becomes a mother so how could the father provide more then the mother a woman provides different love than a man thats just how it is sorry to say but men and women are simply not equal in velpoe never ever be equal women have babies men do not have babies,1,NOT
feminist will only listen to females but when men tells them theyre wrong it somehow turns into sexual abuse ,2,NOT
not much to miss about something that doesnt exist,1,NOT
so its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,1,NOT
great video but feeling bad for saying this the narrators voice is quite whiny and unengaging ,1,NOT
   no more explanation,1,NOT
what that it doesnt exist,1,NOT
basically because women take a larger role in raising children,1,NOT
the gender wage gap doesnt exist there proof that it real,1,NOT
what you idiots miss in gender wage gapyou cant claim theres a wag gap and then use earnings in your argument,2,NOT
did anyone ever research where the money these men make goes,1,NOT
why is this so boring,1,NOT
if the woman works as long as men theyll get paid the same easy as that,1,NOT
no all this is fake news the patriarchy is behind it all reeeeeeeeeeeee,2,NOT
i really dont think there is a gender wage gap for blimp pilots largely because at this point i feel like there are only like  left and i feel like they are all  year old divorce men with names like horace victor and ralph,2,NOT
damn it vox dont make me like one of your videos,1,NOT
now being a mom is damaging for women that kind of ideas are breaking families what we need to do it is to appreciate the importance of women as moms it is an integral part of our society i am not saying that men doesnt need to help more but you cant deny that there are things that only moms can do give birth breastfeeding etc,1,NOT
to the guys saying career women shouldnt have a family or get pregnant if they want the same wage then you guys would be fine if all the women decided not to have your babies until they turned y old right or if they decided never to have sex until they wanted to have a child w you which meant youd have to be in a committed relationship cause it seems thats the only option women are being given,1,NOT
this video wasnt terrible you actually acknowledge that women gone into more less paying jobs than men and that they are more likely to stay at home with their kids instead of staying overtime at work i honestly expected this video to be garbage but it was actually decent,1,NOT
at  did anyone notice the funny jobs like blimp pilot crossword puzzle writer,1,NOT
i see a lot of people on this thread commenting about how the wage gap doesnt exist and that this is feminist propaganda but they fail to see that the extremist view of the feminist is that there is a wage gap out of malicious intent from males where in the real world the wage gap is a combination of unfortunate circumstances and averages between differing career choices while i believe we should challenge the extreme interpenetration of the wage gap i do believe it in fact exists and we should be doing more to understand it rather than shifting blame or denying its existence,1,NOT
there were two persons both  they had exactly the same job the same education the guy got an amount of money and when the girl asked about his job he mentioned how much he earned she got a little less so if you take how much he earns and make it  dollar she earned like  cents so he got a little more money even though they had the same job same age and the same education,1,NOT
or have man take on bigger responsibility at home,1,NOT
i just found this but thank you for clearing up the description of the wage gap i heard this statistic told over and over and found it impossible to believe that the majority of people today would willingly keep a womans wage lower than a mans they just wouldnt get away with it today,1,NOT
thank god ive been saying this for years,1,NOT
you make choices choices to work at jobs where you have a work life balance i dont understand why anybody thinks they deserve a kings ransom for caring more about their free time than their career,1,NOT
the only way to get rid of this problem is to get rid of all laws and government and kill everyone,5,ABU
well that turned pretty quick as soon as a few astute folks did some  minute research into the  cents on the dollar argument and found it to be a fallacy in correlation its now flipped to women make choices to work lower paying jobs in general than men because society pressures them to do so well from what ive seen the last ten years there are so many entities from advocacy organizations to notable individuals encouraging women to pursue higher paying jobs and work more like men do that even that argument is becoming ridiculous how about we allow folks to do what they want see them as individuals instead of lumping them into interest groups and see if our society starts acting rationally for once,1,NOT
vox can you please say what your units are on literally any of your graphs apparently women earn  less than men when they are around   or what your graphs are literally meaningless without units,1,NOT
i think this video is well put for what it is i would like sources to back up the data in your video i also think that some of the reason the men care for their kids more is because it isnt possible for them most companys offer paid leave to women but none to men iirc thanks for reading thoughts,1,NOT
yeah feminists so stfu haha jk but seriously still stfu,2,NOT
 women are less willing to work overtime on call hours extremely valuable for nurses lawyers doctors etc  men are willing to work alot more hours  women dominate fields that dont have a high salary potential psychology social work gender studies  if women really were getting paid  for every dollar why wouldnt a company only hire women seems like that would be an easy way to cut labor costs by   gender wage gap is not result of sexism it is a result of personal choice,1,NOT
listen i dont get paid for taking care of my cat so why should you get paid for taking care of your kid you dont have to have a kid you knowunless rape so the only people to blame are yourselves if thats your excuse dont get me wrong this goes to everyone stay at home dads are increasing over the years,1,NOT
if women believe that they are unfairly paid less than their other employees then they should raise the issue at their next review they can take the issue to their manager,1,NOT
its great that you dont blame it on discrimination try to explain it and be completley neutral,1,NOT
why do jobs pay less when you have a child they know you need more money to support both you and your new addition and yet they pay you less what do they look at a mother of four and go oh this woman needs more money lets give her so little money it wont make any difference and then get mad when she asks for a raise,1,NOT
i figured it out  apparently  is  less than  my male math says that should be ,1,NOT
women still take on a disproportionate share of childrearing tasks i agree this is true but this a decision made by the woman and her spouse their employerthe govtsociety have no culpability here if you want to do fewer domestic tasks marry a person who is willing to do more the reality is any man choosing to do more domestic work will also be in the same position its not gender discrimination its life choices resulting in calculable reduction in earnings over time,1,NOT
vox is to buzzfeed how voss is to toilet water,2,NOT
no its called an earnings gap you autists and its mainly because men usually have higherpaying jobs and as far as i know tend to keep their jobs for longer amounts of time on average besides that theres a variety of different reasons for different pay averages,2,NOT
i couldnt even imagine that vox would make a video like this its a good thing,1,NOT
what people realize about the gender wage gap it doesnt exist,1,NOT
 bucks on that every answer down similar to doesnt exist are issued by men anyone want in in this poll,2,NOT
is there a wage rape tho ,5,ABU
keep dreaming especially when considering the difference in iq between the sexes,2,NOT
there is no wage gap,1,NOT
finally someone who shuts up feminists crying about patriarchy with researched facts love you vox,1,NOT
it was much better when women could just get a job when they get out of school have a family  retire to look after the kids they didnt have to worry about work because there was more money available to pay their husbands wage now we have these feminazis who want women to work their arse off to prove some psychological point that women can work as well whereas before they could relax  have a nice quiet life now we have this wage gap myth that is splitting people apart whereas before it was you either had a good paying job or a minimum wage job,3,NOT
you know why men are paid more because guess who has to stay behind when a building is on fire or a ship sinking you mean i cant get a lousey dollar more,2,NOT
women tend to go for a more flexible hours sitting in a chair desk job also women need maternal leave and are the ones who need to ask for sick days in order to take care of a sick child i believe its as simple as that,1,NOT
wagesearnings talking about a wage gap is incorrect if there truly were a wage gap then companies would hire more women to save the money from the wage gap what we have is an earnings gap yes men make more money but not because we get paid more for the same job and the same amount of work more men choose work over family time more women choose family time over work here in lies the difference there is nothing to fight for as there is nothing to fight against it is illegal for companies to discriminate based on gender,1,NOT
both genders have the same rights so they are equal,1,NOT
what do women do in their s and s ,2,NOT
the only gap is because women choose different jobs than men men and women are not the same yes they deserve equal opportunity and totally have that in this country but men and women have many distinct differences that we dont need to try and eliminate let women be women and men be men,1,NOT
i always tell people the wage gap isnt that simple its there but that most famous number is so misleading and vague as you guys say,1,NOT
men earn more because on average they both work about  more hours a week and  more years of their life      gives you  theres your pay gap more money for doing more work and that seems fair,1,NOT
after years of being debunked vox tries to claim credit for the clarification that the wage gap is actually an earnings gap still tries to push the narrative that the gap is unjust and should be closed,1,NOT
they miss the fact that it is not true because it does not account for hours worked,1,NOT
the wage gap is a compilation of average earnings between men and women it is and has been illegal to pay women less for the same job for nearly half a century,1,NOT
google under pays men,1,NOT
the wage gap is bullshit,2,NOT
 feminist died in this video,2,NOT
this does not apply to any minority male,1,NOT
i really dont think the wage gaps a problem afterall most woman ive seen want the benefits of being a man without any of the huge disadvantages,1,NOT
omfg there is no such thing as the wage gap i have a friend and she gets paid the same amount as me so stfu it does not exist and btw your getting that information from over  years ago,1,NOT
whispers hey guys watch the video before you comment,1,NOT
my mom only make more than my dad cause she the exuective director,1,NOT
this is false propaganda,2,NOT
what people miss its not true how people sell it to you mis used statistic,1,NOT
is this the same about australia,1,NOT
the solution is nanny robots if you elect me for president i will grantee you nanny robots phonzo cisne for ,2,NOT
nobody cares about your stupid career whats important is the love that comes from the babys you make women didnt have to work before now they have to work thats your equal rights,2,NOT
generally men demand more money ask for raises more often while for some reason women dont ask for raises as often  this is a stat that could be being missed ,1,NOT
the weird part of youtube again,1,NOT
 year out of business school and already making k damn,1,NOT
it doesnt exist,1,NOT
its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,1,NOT
ive said something like this for a while now the wage gap exists in some workplaces but women in general dont earn  less when it happens its more like  less and guess what that  is illegal and is probably only still there because people often choose not to talk about what they are getting paid by a company as well as their credentials,1,NOT
i know something people miss about it not real friendo,1,NOT
the vox should do a video on any people or groups tend to react so negatively to views that dont match their own maybe touching on behaviours line brigading on reddit groups like the redpill and even how many people are the believers and how many are just there to watch and encourage discord,1,NOT
somaybe make works hours more flexible just spitballing i have flexible starting and it makes it really easy to structure your day around family without being penalized for it,1,NOT
well the concluding argument was interesting i wonder if there downsides of make jobs have more flexible hours,1,NOT
k with a business degree bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha keep dreaming ,2,NOT
these are all imaginary problems this shows your life is so good you worried about the stupidest things,2,NOT
maybe just maybe men and women are not built the same so they strive for different jobs o,1,NOT
gender wage gap is a myth case closed,1,NOT
men try to earn a higher salary as a way to get a wife this is obviously truer between the age of  and  when men are more likely to be looking for a wife then theres the fact that men are more likely to be relied on as a breadwinner not sure that is a social privilege to be honest so they work longer hours with less flexible and favourable conditions and negotiate more aggressively for salary women dont generally prioritise work in the same way so they n average earn less very simple there is no need to forcibly engineer society the way feminists want to see it there is no wage gap the proposed solutions for it are almost invariably profoundly sexist and illiberal also  focusing on making hours flexible rather than on the quality of the end productservice sounds like a recipe for a failed company,1,NOT
lmao the gap doesnt exist its just a median between men and women women choose less paying jobs thus resulting in this wage gap,1,NOT
it doesnt exist anymore,1,NOT
i think shes womansplaining at us,1,NOT
im a normal heterosexual male  didnt hear about this gender pay gap until couple years ago at first i thought very briefly why men earned moreif anything i thought women would have earned more by giving men sexual favours to get to the tophonestly this was what i could come up with lol and i couldnt understand why a male heterosexual would even have a desire to pay women lessabsolutely nothing apparent to me but then i heard the various reasons whyfrom ppl like jordan petersonand now i know the reasons for the gap it is nothing about men deliberately or desiring to pay women less just cause they are womenits a byproduct of the choices and other stuff like how its measured etc,1,NOT
thank god liz didnt do this video,2,NOT
i think it boils down to the types of jobs income economic stability and inflation just to name a few,1,NOT
the survey about the amount of work men do in households only had a sample size of two households way way too small to have statistical significance,1,NOT
only thing that this video suggests is that women arent as smart or as hard working as man,1,NOT
great video the gender wage gap is real sexism is real racism is real but doing nothing but complaining wont make a difference women and men pick different jobs with a lot but not all women choosing to have kids or lower paying jobs in a variety of different fields for example a vetobgynpediatricianpsychologistpsychiatrist will obviously make less then heart and brain surgeons why do women gravitate towards lower paying jobs its their choice why do women have kids its their choice so,1,NOT
you never mentioned the fact that men work more hours than women do for the same level of job in the same sector that also contributes,1,NOT
watch the the video you dumbasses it clearly states that the debate about wage gap cannot be summed up in a sentence,2,NOT
 its a myth,1,NOT
maybejust maybe its not a bad thing that women take on more infant raising responsibilitymind blown i knowand maybejust maybemen are more productive than woman in the workplace on averagemind blown again i knoweven if there was a wage gap itd be womens own fault,1,NOT
its simple dont have children and work the jobs that men work and you wont get paid less this whole gender wage gas bs never takes into the account the amount of men that die in the process of making all that extra money you know for the life of me ive never seen a woman that works in the field of heavy demolition and hazmatmight have something to do with the fact you have to strip all your cloths off and run around in a paper thin tyvek suit with a papr mask for  hrs per day all while sweating your ass off all day longor freezing it off it can go both ways there is no happy medium in between our modern economy isnt based off of paying people to do basically nothing and in terms of employers its not their responsibility to pay women more because they have less free time to actually work in life its your personal choices that determine what your net worth is and if you personally think being a single motheror whatever the case is entitles you to somehow make more money for doing less work for another individualcompany your delusional thats just not how things work in north america and for that you can blame capitalism,1,NOT
god thats so stupid just get paid for what you deserve you shouldnt get more for less work,1,NOT
women take care of the kids while the male works the harder or more dangerous job to generate better income whats new let me be a female so i can be a housekeeper while my partner works ill take that any day,1,NOT
good video objective and informative,1,NOT
so women should have to take certain in many cases less paying jobs just to close the wage gap closing the wage gap is great and needs to be done but restricting the jobs women should take doesnt really achieve the overarching goal,1,NOT
i thought the title was what people miss about gender,1,NOT
but you cant tell this to any of the feminists now a days because then it would be their responsibility to make the right choices and their entire movement is all about denying responsibility they claim that women in this country have no autonomy by pretending that they dont have it they want to escape their accountability by throwing their problems onto a nonexistent enemy who has a supposed advantage or privilege that they dont when in fact that supposed enemy makes their own choices with what to do with their lives and either accept the benefits or live with the consequences,1,NOT
  k is not   less than  k that would be  k you are obviously not qualified to talk about this or any subject that contains any numbers any claim of actual qualifications would instead disqualify you as ruthless liars willing to go to any lengths of dishonesty in order to sell your bullshit agenda nice try though,1,NOT
science with flexible hours hahahahahahahahahaha nah its just that people whos into bussiness is much more well stupid hahaha they are much more sexist science usually requires much harder schedules than any other field when youre into a proyect aside from that pretty good video,1,NOT
oh no they dont support my opinion because they told the truth dislike,1,NOT
i think vox failed to notice that women dont have the same jobs as men,1,NOT
my parents are both pharmacists,1,NOT
 somebody sounds like a certain former google engineer,1,NOT
i applaud you on this video you didnt complain but instead gave a solution well done,1,NOT
what people miss is thats retarded and immoral to persue a society were every arbitrary defined group of people earns the same,1,NOT
sooo it doesnt exist women just work shorter hours choose the jobs they want that also coincidentally pay less and so many other things give  average women the chance to be in a computer job and do the same for men and the results will be different shocking i know,1,NOT
if ugys pay more for stuff we then we should get paid more example insurance,1,NOT
k but the wage gap doesnt exist first of all its illegal to have the wage gap going do to a law made in the s second of all if the wage gap did exist then only women would be working this information doesnt account for sick days or maternity leave just the raw income,1,NOT
how does overtime or overall hours worked play into this,1,NOT
this would make sense if men and women were equal beings which they obviously arent i guess it takes a  year old looking at hisher genitals to know that,1,NOT
the fact it does not exist,1,NOT
feminist gather and spam dislike triggered killallmen endhumanity,2,NOT
this isnt equality,1,NOT
but people on the comments are even watched the video anyway just educate all people to help in domestic commission and help rise children but sometimes seems that both genders want just to complain,1,NOT
 tell that to my mom,1,NOT
why is this even a problem its all about choice they earn more college degrees than men so they have more opportunities its up to them to take it how is this even a feminist issue,1,NOT
there is no wage gap men work  longer hours than women were  times more likely to die in the workplace then women,1,NOT
this was funny,1,NOT
did anyone in this comments section actually watch the video lmao,1,NOT
im confused isnt gender a personal choice then why cant people just choose the gender that leads to higher eranings btw it is ok to automatically dislike a video from vox they cannot just act like they are rational and unbiased all of a sudden,1,NOT
 nickelback  look at this graph,1,NOT
so why dont companies only hire women,1,NOT
earnings doesnt equal wage earnings gap is explained as fake if hiring women was cheaper men wouldnt be employed,1,NOT
your body your choice your responsibility,1,NOT
everything cool until the explanation of why gap is bigger for business job seems a little made up in my opinion,1,NOT
its cause they werent counting ethots,1,NOT
it does exist here as well i live in an oil producing arab country as an example a female english teacher would earn about  dollars per month a male arab teacher would earn about  per month both have the same college degree they say it is to encourage more men to become teachers men also get about  increase in their salaries for every child they have so if a guy has  kids he would get a  increase in his salary the women however get nothing a man can apply for a government house if he is married but a woman cannot he gets about  dollars for getting married and they say it is to pay the dowry so if he marries  wives which is still legal here than he would get  dollars and if he has  kids from each wife he would be a millionaire i dont even want to calculate anymore,1,NOT
have you looked into what gender fluid is,2,NOT
bout to get cancelled lmao,3,NOT
i love trish but no i dont understand ,2,NOT

im watching this video while eating kfc gawd im disrespectful,2,NOT
at that time she was still with seanmaking certain decisions when she felt really good and happy about everything things changed she is currently going through a heartbreak and i dont think that she would stick with this diet i think people should be careful and not say everything on social media,2,NOT

bruh you ever heard of gender fluid,2,NOT
the truth is that freelee is good at what she does and shes a good enough leader for the vegan movement theres always room for improvement in everything and everybody being completely positive would be nice in a puppies  sunshine world that we dont live in it would be good for her image but the truth is that controversy sparks peoples interest and thats what freelee does she speaks up questions calls people out on their bullshit she does shit sitting back and making what i eat in a day videos is fine i love those videos too but veganism needs exposure most people arent vegan not because they dont want to but because theyre clueless as to whats really happening and freelee plays an important role in just that raising awareness and since the youtube community and the world in general if you ask me is fueled by drama and controversy that is exactly what she does and shes pretty good at it say what you will but shes authentic at the end of the day she does what has to be done and shes honest about it keep rocking,1,NOT
it says that you watched it ,2,NOT

you did it,1,NOT
hi freelee  i hope youre all right in the last couple of videos you seem so unhappy and kinda insecure i know that there is a lot of stuff going on on the internet and lots of people just spread negativity i hope youll get through this time and be fine always remember youre worth it youve helped so many people and changed their lifes to a better youre a good person dont let the haters get you down ,1,NOT
it wasnt pre recorded because she made jokes and made a comment about how this video is not for vegans to watch she knew she was going to get backlash yet she didnt care and last why would she make that remark if it was prerecorded,1,NOT
she should go hard on alot of fruit in the first couple weeks so she can really feel the big energy level increase compared to her previous diet,1,NOT
further proof that youre a complete legend freelee another high profile person affected by your videos who is then willing to make the change go girl  youre amazing for far more than just your aesthetics,1,NOT
we dont claim her end of story,2,NOT
trisha is a transphobereason being shes saying its a choice saying theythem are multiple people when its not it can be a singular pronoun,5,ABU
i think what shes trying to say is shes pan,2,NOT
im so confused i cant even put a good comment because i dont understand we need someone shane help,2,NOT
okay so i am not trans however i am pan but from what ive seen so far the trans community doesnt claim her,2,NOT
blaire mf white where r u at,2,NOT
trishhhhh noooo why didnt you educate yourself on what it actually means to be transgender before you recorded this i sense youre trying to vocalize feelings n maybe lean toward gender fluid which is great and you should explore this and be open and pride about it hell yes but youre totally misunderstanding and misconstruing being trans and def saying some things that are pretty wildly offensive even if you didnt intend it to be yeeeeeesh educate yourself first bc you gotta at the very least understand the terms before you claim to identify i support you exploring your gender identity and sexuality but please please please invest some time in educating yourself first youre gonna ostracize yourself and others in the community with hastily labeling yourself without understanding xx,2,NOT
whatwhat are you going through,2,NOT
honey you are confused,3,NOT
dear god no,3,NOT
oh no honey what is you doin ,2,NOT
am i the only one here who is fucking confused on what is going on,3,NOT
if that makes any sense no it fucking doesnt get the fuck off youtube and get some help,5,ABU
she be collecting all letters of lgbtq,3,NOT
i dont like how people are mean she is obviously a bit confused she or he is having a gender crisis she has my support,1,NOT
im probably going to get lots of hate for this but i relate a lot to this video i am very feminine to most people but i relate a lot to males i feel very masculine in some ways and very feminine in others some days i want to be a male and i feel so lost other days i want to be hyper feminine its very confusing to others and also myself and its so hard,1,NOT
i had seizure just listening to her,3,NOT
it sucks that people cant just let her do what she wants and not complain and fucking cry about everything,3,NOT
please for the love of god someone say sike im actually scared is she joking,3,NOT
wow this was just a hot mess she needs to seek help,3,NOT
im ashamed i gave a click to this shit,3,NOT
this doesnt add up wheres the dysphoria does she not realise how its works in general like the transition part,2,NOT
trish i think your view on who you think you might be is based on societys opinions the reasons you think you might be a male are based on straight masculine mens opinion on you as a girl thats the type you attract and as for you being attracted to gay men it could be an emotional thing you enjoy having sex with anyone not matter their orientation but you might feel like you identify with a gay man because thats who you are attracted too if you want a feminine boyfriend they do exist but the majority of men who are attracted to you seem to be masculine men so you feel thats what youre stuck with and as for being penis envy i am too girl i think most women can agree that if they had a penis they would be happier because being a cis male is easy and accepted they can be dominant and assertive and be considered manly and thats normal and bonus points if youre a white cis man because they get everything handed to them being drag looks fun and exciting and they play dress up and youre right they dont always wear a face full of make up but its their thing that they like to get all glam that doesnt necessarily mean you identify with them you just have the same hobbies i am woman love to put on cute pastel dresses mostly cuz i hate pants lol and wear make up but half the times i dont feel like taking the extra time to do all that,2,NOT
i havent watched a video of hers in years and i am not trying to make fun of her looks but to me she looks seriously ill seriously like she is on some insane drugs very sad,5,ABU
oh nothis just aint it you shouldnt of even posted anything until you fully understood yourself and maybe talked to someone to clarify how and what you feel what youre saying does not match up to the im transgender there are many other genders i think you maybe classify more as gender fluid you said you dont want to be offensive but you basically making everyone who hates on trans n others believe they are all like this you could of went about this so much better hun,2,NOT
loving trishs new blinged out nails  i wonder if trish will get dragged for this theres ppl that are actually transgendered lol this just seems like a scream for attention trish is a female that sometimes doesnt like to glam each day no need for the extra stupid labels trish always looks for something random to bring up lol smh,3,NOT
i think i lost some brain cells watching this,3,NOT
werent u a baby two seconds ago,2,NOT
what did jason do to you,2,NOT
sorry girl you liking to be around guys more than girls you feeling like you can relate to a guy you feeling like you would like to see what its like to have a penis none of this means you are transgender it means you like attention you dont have women friends because youre jealous and catty and dont allow yourself to see past a womans threat to you to get to know them or have a real friendship with them and your just in need of internet content to pay the bills,2,NOT
so im not hating ive been watching t since i could remember but i really do not understand this i have multiple friends that are trans they want to be fully the gender they feel as they are they will go to any length to be a guy or girl whoever they are t has went through so many surgeries to get bigger breasts or an ass or a flatter stomach its all to give a girlish appearance ive never had a friend who had purposely made themselves look at opposite gender especially having money they had always tried to achieve to make themselves feel they when they do on the inside out,3,NOT
only came here for the comments,2,NOT
i dont know if i would say im confused i would say that im all of it lol what,2,NOT
you literally just made a video about being a women and having to wear a bra a week ago,2,NOT
i swear this part of youtube is always entertaining,1,NOT
she dont know what genderfluid is and theythem isnt confusing your just a piece of shit who cant respect people,2,NOT
this just clearly shows that some people have nothing to do,3,NOT
you wouldnt be you wouldnt be upset about being called a guy if you are a omfg,3,NOT
im a girl but no im not but yes i am,2,NOT
i hope its not clikbait i support anything you do trish but this isnt a topic for clikbait  scared to watch,1,NOT
you do you boo boo we love you youre amazing fuck what anyone else has to say youre beautiful whatever you want to be you can be it,1,NOT
i finally get to use this line trisha you dumb attention seeking slut just stop you sound like an airhead and look like  of you is plastic,6,ABU
says im a guy proudly shows off tits to get more views in different videos,2,NOT
dont take our community for your own fame were worth more than that,1,NOT
youre a fucking idiot this is incredibly offensive to transgender people delete this you literal dumpster fire,7,ABU
trisha talks nonsense to the camera the way people talk to their best friend behind closed doors i respect that,1,NOT
i shaved my head and i dont wear makeup so what now am i a boy,2,NOT
not a gay man,2,NOT
as a trans person i find this disrespectful tbh,2,NOT
its so sad to read these comments because i can understand everything you said i as well am a girl who feels like i should of been a boy except i like girls as well and feminine boys i dont like really masculine men and i really hate being dominated by a guy ive had sex a few times with masculine men and i have to say i hate it everything you are saying is so relatable for me and im so glad you made this video dont listen to anyone in the comments opinions they will never understand,1,NOT
as a nb teen this video makes me so uncomfortable you invalidate people in this state that being trans is a choice and overall are just digging yourself into a hole educate yourself on this shit before you try and claim to be transgender when youre not and have it all wrong,2,NOT
trishatheres a such difference as identifying with and identifying as,2,NOT
what you described is not being transgender it sounds like youre describing body dysmorphia,2,NOT
the way she explains how shes feeling it sounds like she non binary trans gender means you change fully not just dont wear makeup,2,NOT
 as a girl ive never related to masculinity sis,2,NOT
no trisha you arent trans you just dont like gender stereotypes its either that or youre doing this for attention which either way is fucked up also how can you be a bisexual woman and a gay man,2,NOT
gay guy does something common in the gay community trisha oh my god me,2,NOT
bro have u seen a psychologist im worried,3,NOT
its more like transsexual,5,ABU
so yourea gay manand a bisexual womanand an allyand a drag queensis you ever heard of genderqueer genderfluid,2,NOT
can we get most disliked vid on yt pls,3,NOT
shes oops sorry hes literally full of shit,5,ABU
wow this is really what its come to huh,3,NOT
aight i dont agree with trish on this at all and this is because of my question yall are tryna cancel trisha saying shes ftm but acts feminine but yall are fine w people that are ftm who wear makeup nail varnish and wear dresses being ftm and acting feminine will make you dysphoric that is a true sign a person is transgender but yall get upset with people who think someone transgender is their biological sex when they act like their biological sex yes stereotypes are shitty but you have to follow by the stereotypical type of that gender to pass i have spoken to many transgender people and they agree you cant come for trish when you literally praise people for doing the same thing shes doing you praise people that act like the gender they were born and dress like that stereotype of the gender yet you get upset at someone whos doing literally that people may agree of disagree with me but keep this in mind,2,NOT
as a trans guy this video is more than incredibly offensive this is worse for the lgbt community than actual hate videos as her target audience will be roped into believing this bullshit the fact that she said you can choose what gender you are really made me feel an anger i hadnt felt if i had the choice i wouldnt be trans i dont think she realises how hard this journey is,3,NOT
trisha love and praise goes to you honey,1,NOT
theres a word and a term for not being male or female only its genderfluid oh my god t wtf,3,NOT
trish so do i think im transgender  also trish but do i also identify with my natural born gender ,2,NOT
i identify as a robot  or at least a cyborg,2,NOT
not only is this transphobic but this is just offensive in general as a trans man i think what youre describing is body dysmorphia not dysphoria,2,NOT

hey trish you okay  lmao someone help this gal,3,NOT
i was gonna make a comment about how trish is just ignorant and try to see trishs side but if they is gonna come out as trans or mak this video or whatever they could have at least done some research about it first so they wouldnt be so transphobic my goodness and yes im using theythem pronouns for trish bc it seems like they are confused in their gender identity dont identify in the binary rn,2,NOT
trisha is just trying to get with cedric,2,NOT
did she just hit and kill someone with her car,3,NOT
she made  thousand dollars from this video,1,NOT
i like girls but i am a gay man me sigh oh boy this gonna be this kind of video i dont like attention mmk sweetie i am more attracted to gay men honey arent we all lmaooo like no hate on trisha but come on man please please if your going to do this do your research cuz not a lot of what your saying is adding up i really hope this shit aint for views,2,NOT
so question since im not  well informed is she just nuts or confused in terms of what she is would this fall more to the trans community as gender nonconforming genderqueer help a dude out,2,NOT
here before it gets deleted,1,NOT
careful trish i can already hear the sjws coming for you,2,NOT
trisha you know what i mean me actually no i didnt understand any of that wtf,3,NOT
jason was a bottom k,3,NOT
im confused with this vid,2,NOT
theres no such thing as transitioning fully,2,NOT
so you have a pussy or dick  because im trying to eat some ass,6,ABU
you know being a gay man doesnt mean your feminine or anything cause thats what u think it means but it doesnt being gay means u like the same sex not that your a feminine flamboyant guy that can be the case but not always i should do some research u seemed confused,2,NOT
basically what im hearing is that she was happy because she didnt have to try to look nice because she acted like a dude once so now shes trans,2,NOT
in the next video shell confess she is in love with cedric i love you trish but i think you are just confused,2,NOT
just because youre more attracted to gay men doesnt mean youre a guy it doesnt work like that honey that just means your more attracted to feminine guys,2,NOT
sounds like you may be genderfluid,2,NOT
jesus you really explained it very well and justified yourself wheres all the hate coming from,1,NOT
i think this is the first video ive ever disliked,2,NOT
heres a tip coming from a ftm trans man stop stereotyping men and women saying that even if you acted slightly more masculine that makes you trans or a man and the reason you like gay men is most probably a fetish cause i know a lot of cis women who find gay men attractive and it is normal to wonder what it would be like to be the other gender but because you question that doesnt mean you are trans so yeah stop before all the angry lgbt members come and attack you,2,NOT
bruh this is bull im just confused,3,NOT
back on drugs ,5,ABU
still love u tho,1,NOT
in other wordsshe is just a whore since she has been with anything with legs,5,ABU
i understand the backlash from this video i understand how misinformed most of this video is but as a member of the lgbt community i think this is an amazing opportunity to educate and correct her on what she thinks is being transgender i think that unfortunately many people share a lot of the same views that trish does in this video i dont know her motives for making this video or how her views became so inaccurate but the way that we as a community react to moments like thesewith backlash and hate or education and unitywill shape the way the world views our community we need to find more ways to unite and educate rather than bash and cancel just my two cents,1,NOT
so youre gender fluid just say that and move on,2,NOT
ok i dont even know what im supposed to think anymore i give off a very masculine and dude vibe hell i wear mens cologne because i like smelling like a man and i dont know who im attracted to i dont care abt what pronouns i use the only thing i set in stone identify as is asexual thats it thank you for listening to me ted talk,1,NOT
i thought u identified as a chicken nugget,2,NOT
if we go by your standards  i guess im trans,2,NOT
i have always wanted to have been born a guy when i was younger i even dressed as i thought boys would dress in the hopes that i would be recognized as a guy before i knew what trans was but i am not trans i know that i do not have gender disphoria which though its highly debated its what kinda cements what makes someone trans just because you envy males or have a fetish for gay men does not mean that you are trans,1,NOT
dude what the fuck are you on,5,ABU
i completely get what you mean drag queen vibes,2,NOT
the way you talk about ppl being fully transition down there and still having female energy is beyond disrespectful fuck i dont think you mean any disrespect by the video but jesus youre confused talk about this with a therapist work kit your views before posting this much rambling to ur very large platform,3,NOT
trisha trolling is fine but ffs leave trans men alone leave trans women alone people who are trans are literally at risk of being murdered because of their identity please stop,2,NOT
why are you saying that being natural and not putting on makeup or doing your hair is not girly and more of a guy thing,2,NOT
cant belive that jason hit that and kiss that,2,NOT
ive never kept up with her but im actually hella pissed off at this video trish youre a dick im sorry its true this video is part of the reason why this community isnt taken seriously im so fucking pissed off because my sister is male to female and i just feel like this is bullshit asking for attention this is bullshit im sorry this is absolute bullshit,6,ABU
so u know its fucking offensive and stupid but did it anyway,5,ABU
trish honey please this is so bad,2,NOT
do you identify as james charles,2,NOT
im sorry not really tho but that was very offensive people dont choose to identify as schizofrenic or mpd people whom put those two diagnosis into the same box are not suffering from either of them she is misinforming people about alot of shit in this video and as a schizofrenic i take that bit to heart i know that was a small part of the context in the video but people whom dont suffer from theese things watching might take those facts with them out into world,2,NOT
no one trish im attracted to gay men so i must be transgender,2,NOT
bruh im trans and im dying  shes so stupid,3,NOT
whole house is pink  but do you girl,2,NOT
i am so proud of you for saying what is on your mind even when you dont have to,1,NOT

i kinda relate with this also i dont see anything wrong with this people just wanna take the piss out of trish coz she reacts,1,NOT
what the fuck,5,ABU
i dont wanna hate and say mean things like others but in the nicest way to say is that you should try to get some help if u need to talk to someone you should if you really are anything but straight you might be nonbinary thats when you sometimes wake to be a women some days and a guy other days theythem are only used mostly for nonbinaries if you want to bea guy you would say hehim in your case i personally dont believe this  because it dosent seem like you are to sexually orientated informed other things have been said by you you need some sort of help i am a closeted bi and some of the things you said were offensive i cant even imagine what actual transgenders feel right now you want to be a female and male if this is true your probably nonbinary,3,NOT

i  i  i ,2,NOT
do i think im a transgender yes a thousand  do i identify with my natural born gender a thousand  thats kinda the thing with being transgenderyou dont identify with your biological gender this is the whole point you dont like your breasts you dont like your curves and the term theythem has nothing to do with being transgender most people who use the pronouns theythem do not identify with either the female pronouns sheher nor the male pronouns hehim im not saying that transgender people can not identify with theythem im saying that it doesnt have anything to do with transgender,2,NOT
okay trisha where is the proof i know you gave us the picture but where the medical reports and the papers,2,NOT
dont know you i have never watched you before but yall need to calm down people go through a processes  it took my transgender daughter  years to finally commit and know who she was for sure the difference is that trisha is doing it on social media in front of the world its like when peopel who were bi had to be harassed by gays and lesbians for just being gay and not wanting to admit it sexuality and gender are spectrums and we all shift along that spectrum even when we finally know who we are trisha if your using the community step off if your finding your place and identity stand tall,1,NOT
i think shes just confused,2,NOT

my eyes rolled right out of my head trisha honey stop,3,NOT
tbh im here for this lol,2,NOT
trisha you have other issues and confusion with your body and sex but i dont think you are trans i think therapy would help i think it is because you were made fun of you feel confused and is why you need attention from your partners i mean that in the kindest and sweetest way some people not saying you are realize they have been sexually abused and once they get help then deal with issues i am a sex abuse advocate so no shame we blame the perpetrators not the victim,2,NOT
im so confused what is going on i,2,NOT

look into demiboy demigirl nonbinary and gender non conforming im not saying youre trans or youre not as a transmasculine demiboy i think that i have no room to judge anyone ive been judged way too much myself for that but i think you really really need to educate yourself and not harm a community that has been harmed way to much sorry its hard to know when youre trolling and when you arent anymore and thats your own fault please educate yourself not just for your sake for once,2,NOT
lol youtube comments so toxic then you go to her insta and all the comments are positive yikkers,2,NOT

why dont you just identify as nonbinary so you can be in the gray area of gender and transition whatever way you choose to instead of identifying as trans because what youre describing doesnt sound like transgender,2,NOT
there are a few good points in here but with the amount of bs and lack of research they are overlooked i implore ya t to do some research on gender fluid also never relate someone who is lgbtq to someone with a disability thats all i got for now,2,NOT
i really thinks shes having a mental breakdown nothing new,3,NOT
just because trisha has a massive following doesnt make anything she says about herself  is invalid or done as some form of stunt for clout if she had only  followers she would be treated like any other transgender because theres alot that goes into an identity and just because one person has a completely different trans experience than you doesnt make your transness invalid a community is open to all not for those who fit within this specific frame or category of what they think transgenders should be if she identifies as a male then she identifies as male you can say your opinions to her but to now call her out of her name even after she told you her truth is so messed up and ignorant,2,NOT
as a gay trans guy she isbig yikes i wont be able to satisfy myself or my partner like luv eye,3,NOT
im a vegan  percent but im also a carnivore ,3,NOT
i dont like being center of attentionunless i wanna be center of attention,3,NOT

 most trans people when dating if they have transitioned fully just wont say they were male or female at birth if they want to tell the partner they will on there on time,1,NOT
trish says shes trans bc she likes short hair trishas therapist sorry sister u gotta get a new therapist,3,NOT
i cant believe you are walking around free you should be locked up for your safety and the safety of others isnt there anyone who cares just a little bit about you who will step in and make sure you get the in depth psychiatric help you are crying out for its like watching a plane crash in really slow motion,5,ABU

ok so heres the translation shes fallen in love with her dancer cedric in an effort to pursue him shes saying shes a gay man just another facet of her mental demise ,3,NOT
this is her truth who is anyone to question or judge her for it you dont have to understand it its what was on her heart and what she lives with if she wants to be gender fluid its her life  let people live cant you just create a safe space for people to be without all this nonsense in the comments yall are fung weirdos,2,NOT

i feel like shes a suuuupppppeeeeeerrrrrr confused gender fluid person,3,NOT
ok trishs feelings are valid she is just using the wrong term to identify no one taught her the label she is going for which is why shes offending a lot of people her description of feelings doesnt match the name she is giving it,1,NOT
hahaha this bitch has an add before this video shes making money off of this shes just mentally ill go get help trisha,5,ABU
hi i dont wanna offend you in anyway i love you and support you but and i understand what your going through im confused about my gender but maybe instead of saying your ftm or transgender maybe start with genderfulid like hehimtheythem thats what i go by its mainly because that fact  i believe you have breast implants or whatever  you show them off and ect like that a lot im a femine male but i hate wearing skirts dresses bras i actually dont own a bra now i only have a binder and sports bras i love make up and dressing up i cosplay a lot and cosplay girls but i very rarely show off my cleavage i did it for a cosplay once and it made me extremely uncomfortable and i struggle comin out so id say be slow with it say your genderfulid and then if you really want to transition like top surgery testosterone ect ect i dont mean it offend you in anyway as i say as im confused about my gender but still support you no matter what gender you are ,2,NOT
i hate trish she is such an offensive person and such a moron how does she have any fans,5,ABU

i understand getting teased and bullied for things you cant control as a kid and how much that can affect you and how you see yourself as an adult i think more than anything you need to go talk to some people therapists that deal with identity and you need to really talk to trans people i understand you want to speak your truth but im not sure that you know enough or know who you are enough to talk about this this openly,2,NOT
trisha bringing back the yes im a vegan yes i eat meat we exist meme except on a whole other level lmaoooo,3,NOT

when you trying so hard to stay relevant ,3,NOT
lets unpack this so im transgender diagnosed dysphoria transgender the fact that she is called herself trans when she obviously is not is sickening it hurts the trans community being trans is a mental disorder not a game of fucking dress up wow you were more tomboy as a kid that doesnt male you trans the fact that she has to compensate of how shes still feminine by saying that since shes a gay man that we like more frilly things i beleive that when it is a cis male but when you are a transgender male you will want to pass as such you wont want to look girly because being misgendered hurts trisha needs to get it throigh her thick skull that this is not okay being trans isnt dress up being trans is where your brain and body dont match up hers matches up just fine this has me fuming you arent trans if you dont have dysphoria trisha you arent passing as male that is a key thing to a transgender male you are a grown ass women who needs to stop playing dress up and hurting a community you arent apart of,3,NOT

im sure there are plenty of girls who like going out without guys attention lol  not doing makeup or anything else and being left alone i am also attracted to more feminine males  and more masculinebut fem females  they meet in the middle doesnt mean im trans,1,NOT
noone privileged cis white women hm i am going to pretend to be trans,2,NOT

god im sorry but this is literally making me feel so sad and dysphoric when she kept saying that she felt trans people could never satisfy their partners i really just went  that fucking hurt bro ksjdkd,3,NOT
 just here for the comments,2,NOT
trisha the man paytas yeah sounds made up bc it is made up,3,NOT
this is actually an interesting conversation on gender just because she doesnt have all the correct words doesnt make it crazy,1,NOT
so they are a gender fluid hoe,5,ABU
hun go back to sleep for a few hours,3,NOT
trisha i dont like being harassed my straight guys is this being transgender,3,NOT
ahaha people are focusing on one certain thing from the video and acting like its the only reason she gave and i bet they didnt even watch the whole thing,1,NOT
so shes jealous of male gender norms like not being expected to wear make up or being assertive lol,2,NOT
if your born a female but look like a boy you are a female unless you actually get trans,2,NOT
as a trans man whos on hrt id just like to say there is no one in the comments or anyone who is allowed to tell anyone how much theyre allowed to conform whether they have to be on hrt or have to have surgery you dont need to have dysphoria to be trans you can literally use what pronouns make you most comfortable i think we should leave it at that,1,NOT
this is fuckinf horrible and her posting this video is horrible she is ridiculous,5,ABU
one question do you experience gender dysphoria if not you literally cannot be trans without it as thats what tells your brain that youre not in the right body,2,NOT
transgender denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex tomboy is a girl who exhibits characteristics or behaviors considered typical of a boy including wearing masculine clothing and engaging in games and activities that are physical in nature and are considered in many cultures to be unfeminine or the domain of boys,1,NOT
so shes attracted to cedric and feels the need to make a video to justify that,2,NOT
ive seen this bitch floating around youtube on her massive inflatable tits for years and ive never understood how someone so ugly both inside and out has a following speaking directly to her you are the epitome of the dumb blonde stereotype and i cant imagine anyone wanting to be your friend associate with you let alone attend your funeral when you finally grace us by leaving this planet,6,ABU
youre a fat trump supporting ugly cuck loving skank,7,ABU
my god the like to dislike ratio is actually insane,2,NOT
rough video to watch,2,NOT
the term she was looking for is bigender she just didnt know what terminology to use,2,NOT
where tf in this video did she ever show she was transforming into a boy like tf this is clickbate,3,NOT
i love that the thumbnail was her dressed as shane,2,NOT
i start testosterone in less than  hours ive been waiting for this for six years i cannot tell you how fucking invaliding and disgusting and above all wrong and dysphoria inducing for actual trans people to hear you spread this absolute bullshit fucking stop,3,NOT
so shes a tomboy ,2,NOT
this world will never be vegan but enjoy your life in a cult,3,NOT
what a banger,1,NOT
its okay to be confused i confused body dysmorphia for gender dysphoria and i was under the transgender label for two years i was lost and didnt have answers to my questions i am now happy and going by sheher born gender its okay to be confused and try to find yourself whats not okay is saying you are trans when you are  comfortable with being the born gender you are its okay if you want to be t and you want to be more masculine however i dont think this is the right label now when you are finding yourself its okay to go through things and see what fits and what doesnt but i would suggest making that a personal journey off camera and coming back when you find yourself the trans community and the lgbt community in general get a lot of hate because people throw labels they know nothing about on themselves as a trend trans people are no longer valid in societies eyes because of transtrenders  not saying what you are going through is a trend but its something that takes more time and shouldnt be determined by the fact that you like gay men and you feel like you would be more respected if you had a penis its true you may not be just a cis women and i hope that you are able to find and love yourself because thats all anyone deserves i dont think you should be hated but i dont think you should jump into this label either because it will only cause backlash for you and the trans community with that said i hope you do well and find who you really are  in the end you are the one who knows yourself best,2,NOT
the fact you made  dollars from the video is disgusting you should give that money to the community you are basically taking the piss out of you are a disgrace,3,NOT
people have liked her even before this lmao ight,3,NOT
i never comment on youtube videos but this is too much i have been out as a trans guy for  whole years and i almost killed myself because of the people around me and how they were treating me they have gotten better because they understood and  years later some people still dont i work for respect everyday and this could take some of that progress away youre not a guy please stop,2,NOT
as someone actually part of the lgbt community a gay man all i can say is shame this is not us we do not own this dont think that all of us are like this cuz thats not true at all shes just a tom boy and everyone knows it ,2,NOT
this video is confusing to say the least but what she says makes some sense if we look at this from a crossdreamer perspective a lot of trans people live and present as their assigned gender even if their real identity is trans or nonbinary there are good and bad reasons for why they do so but the fact that they are not transitioning does not make them less trans her frustration of being a gay man in a womans body reflects the kind of pain many nontransitioning trans people feel i guess some will dismiss the whole idea as preposterous given her extreme femme appearance but many trans people make desperate attempts at living up to the stereotypes trying to fit in kirsten beck was a bearded navy seal fighting in afghanistan before she gave up fighting herself moreover characteristics like femme and butch are not restricted to one gender after all these were terms created in the lesbian community i dont know if trisha is trans but she deserves the chance to find out for herself,1,NOT
is this a joke trish i havent been watching you for a while im sorry but is this a prank or something somebody tell me edit  i just read the comments and um i am a lesbian and this is horrible trisha i watched you for a while now and you were my getaway and i just wow,3,NOT

hair length doesnt define your gender,2,NOT
i cant fathom the stupidity of this video honestly you have a type that doesnt make you a gay man the closest you could be to any of this is androgynous,3,NOT

do you realize that youre one of the reasons why the trans community isnt taken seriously i dont wanna hurt the trans community youre hurting them with this video take this shit down and get a therapist,3,NOT
im sorry people are hating on you so much in the comments i wish i like knew you personally bc i am trans and have a ton of trans friends n would love to tell you a lot about different trans experiences one piece of advice would be to not get too invested in online trans communities theres a huge war in the trans world rn and its most definitely not good to people just joining trans communities online,1,NOT
i guess trying to be black got boring for her so now she wants to try her hand at trans she makes it so hard to actually like her and stand up for her,3,NOT
 turn on cc youre welcome,2,NOT

soon many farms will run out of the water and soil quality necessary to grow vegan food the pesticides may also kill off all the bugs necessary to pollinate crops ruminant animals dont need fertilizer pesticide or irrigation they are quite happy on land where crops cannot be grown vegans cant even digest the food they eat bacteria must digest it for them then most of the fats the bacteria create are excreted instead of absorbed because the bacteria are in the colon its difficult to regard a diet that requires supplementation with respect,3,NOT

me eating lunch person omg stop shoving your vegan beliefs down my throat youre so aggressive me i i was just tryna eat i dont really care what you eat i just dont wanna eat it,2,NOT
if you do your research youll find that the government passed a bill that states that no woman can be paid less than a man working the same job and the same position working the same hours so next time you make a video discriminating against men do some research,2,NOT
vox you need to know there is no pay gap,2,NOT
how do we fix the gender wage gap does a mindshift happen at home where men share the household work equally with women or is there some policies or change at work that can reduce the gender wage gap,1,NOT
why do the vast majority of people who claim that the wage gap doesnt exist never show any evidence to back up their claims,2,NOT
what theyre saying isnt necessarily wrong just for the wrong reasons the pharmacy example is incredibly incredibly flawed and the flexible hours reasoning is as well,1,NOT
as far as i know dont women earn more than men in part time jobs as well as in the age gap between  although only very slightly statistics like the  or  cent per dollar wage are very misleading as it doesnt take into account stuff like stereotypes social norms segregation in the labour market and the other general differences between women and men,2,NOT
get our lord and savior milo in here to teach everyone about the wage gap,3,NOT
 cause biologically thats what women are geared towards doing theres a reason why guys dont make milk imma just point that out to you sjws out there,3,NOT
oh my god wages and earnings are different you keep comparing earnings and calling it wage difference they are two different things women earn less due to their job choicevacation timeraising kidsmaternity leave by working less hours if they didnt they would earn the same amount maybe go back  years and look at the equal pay act of  where you already achieved your goal its like beating in a dead horse jesus christ,3,NOT
wait this liberal video just debunked itself there is a wage gap because women choose less hours it literally said that lmaooo,3,NOT
well then its up to personal responsibility inb culture makes them less consistant in the work force talk to your man,3,NOT
also the more men helping in households and with parenting becomes normal the less of a gender issue this will be i think this is not about giving rights to women i think this is giving rights to women and men thats why its so important for men to support feminism,2,NOT
now try to get explain this to a feminazi,3,NOT
my mum is a boss she earn more than my dad who is also a boss lol,2,NOT
so this video says that the wage gap doesnt come down to gender but what a woman can achieve versus what a man can achieve a woman has to take care of children and has more duties outside of her job so she cannot be as reliable on her job as a man thus she cannot be as good as her job as a man and that is for every job that requires flexible hours like business careers thus she gets paid as much as a man given her achievements this is very interesting that being said why is the conclusion we need jobs to be more flexible for women and not we need to balance housework between men and women how is it normal for a woman to have more duties outside of her work than a man dont both parents have as much responsibility towards their own children towards their own house,2,NOT
the wage gap isnt real,2,NOT
i like how women consistently report being more happy with their lives then men which is reflected in the suicide statistics yet there is this effort to get women to run their lives more like men,2,NOT
wheres all female plumbers ohthey took a lower paying job like becoming a teacher instead wha wha,2,NOT
good job vox,1,NOT
so there is no wage gap,2,NOT
whats stupid about this video is that it only analyzes upper class jobs business sector jobs with  salaries are not at all representative of the wage gap the wage gap exists because working class and middle class jobs of particularly male predominate labor have traditionally been unionized steel workers plumbers electricians factory operators traditionally female jobs have not and theyre almost all in the service sector im sure there are some social sexist reasons for that ironically as traditional masculine jobs are being outsourced abroad both men and women are today left with low paying jobs without a history of unionization thats a big reason why wages have been so stagnant for  years i dont write the news folks i just report it,2,NOT
pharmacy is a more female oriented profession and the hospital i work at for example all managerial positions within the pharmacy department is filled with women not only that but even the higher positions in the pharmacy are still female dominated,1,NOT
because the jobs mens do engineer doctors scientist,3,NOT
in my demographic urban age  women make more than men anyone want to talk about that wage gap,2,NOT
even a broken clock is right twice a day,2,NOT
before you watch the video the wage gap doesnt exist,3,NOT
i dont care that women make less then men men have better jobs thats why they make more and now women make more this video sucks its all false and men should be making more because they try harder while women just cheat on the man thats why they make so much i really dont care about your stupid little oh we need money ehh no you dont yall make less cause you dont have as good jobs idiot this was a horrible video,5,ABU
or i would just stop hiring women,2,NOT
race plays an important part as well,1,NOT
every job i have had men and women got paid the same wage and yet i can create a wage gap very simply within that job example my wife and i work in the same job doing the same hours and getting the same hourly wage we both start the job at  years old and work until we retire we dont have kids and both take the same days off but my wife earns less than me how retirement age  men are forced to work for  years more than women in the uk even though women live longer so even if i we get the exact same wage  it results in a pay gap the gap being the  years wages the man earns extra because he cant claim a pension at the same age on top of that  paying a woman less than a man for the same job is against the law  so if the pay gap was this big then most women would be taking the employer to court and winning which is very easy to do if this is the case focusing on the pay gap in this way is useless and it does not actually look at problems with wages for both men and women  paying the top person in a museum  a year when the rest of the staff are volunteers is wrong political staff being given  for travel an food each day when they only live  miles away is wrong zero hours contracts so that people can be screwed over by the company they work for is wrong both men and women are getting screwed over with regards to wage issues and focusing on a wage gap which is already abolished by law is the least of the problems,2,NOT
woman work different jobs and dont work the same hours as men thats it,3,NOT
women doing different jobs to men  difference in pay  okay women and men doing the same job  difference in pay  not okay,1,NOT
its also maybe the fact the pharmasutrics are a heavy female led perfession,1,NOT
vox is such a joke there is no wage gap,3,NOT
to sum it up  video states that the wage gap isnt because of discrimination but because of what choices women have jobs worktime etc doesnt state that there is a pay gap i conclude that there isnt a discrimination of women but that the fault is in women as they can make more they just generally choose less paying jobs work less not everything is their fault as you can account that women have kids so that influences their earnings,1,NOT
keep bringing in the thumbs down ladies reality is tough,3,NOT
what about the fact that it aint true,3,NOT
 a year im going to business school,1,NOT
there is no wage gap it doesnt exist its a earnings gap which people choose through their job,3,NOT
i think women that are married and have children should be prepared to loose out on some money maybe stop being so selfish for a moment and think about the bigger picture youre a family the child needs a mother especially in the early years to take care and nurture said child if you dont want kids and want to pursue your career go ahead then you will earn as much as your male colleagues,5,ABU
the wage gap statistic is invalid because it does not take into account education years of experience and hours worked so please tell me why you still think this is true,3,NOT
lmao to the people asking why not just hire women have you been watching the video at all if women make less money on average because of kids or other availability issues which is what this suggests then you would need to hire more women than you would have men and women combined just to get all the necessary work done this video suggests that women who can commit as much time as men will make just about as much really if you can split up the parenting load perfectly equally with your spouse and you two have worked the same job for the same amount of time this evidence suggests the wage gap between you two will close,2,NOT
i expected a slimy biased video of misconceptions false information and lies this actually was pretty good,1,NOT
so when is the us going to join the rest of the modern world and have paid maternity leave or better yet just have a paternal leave that both parents can draw from letting both parents raise their child during those very delicate years,1,NOT
should have gone to business school,1,NOT
oh look vox has has finally caught up,1,NOT
this speaker doesnt know what to do with her hands xd,2,NOT
i expceted vox to get this completely wrong,2,NOT
in my country ireland the average man is in employment for  years longer then the average woman last year there was  days of outrage over how after retirement men have more in there pension then women this  year difference was pointed out the issue dissappeared completely,2,NOT
thank you vox for once not putting your usual political agenda ahead of the truth,2,NOT
i guess its not because of discrimination like a lot of feminists say good to know,2,NOT
the company i work for its not uncommon for men to work  hours a weekyet not a single women at the company works that same set of hoursthats all the proof you need,3,NOT
who does most of the diy work,2,NOT
here comes all the meninists,3,NOT
 you want more money  if there was a wage gap why not just hire woman  shut up its feminist talk,3,NOT
wage gap is a myth if u think its real then chances are ur voting for hillary and she wont make it better for woman,2,NOT
i need to ask a question i have compared my pay to women at the same job and it is the same pay so where is the gap i have looked at men in higher payed jobs and noticed they usually involve risk taking of some form so the gap must probably then exist in these levels of employment my question now is if you see fit to charge a man more for insurance because of risky behavior why dont you see it fit to pay men for these traits,2,NOT
wait wait hold up one year out of school on average women are making  a year and men are making  a year haha im pretty sure most grads arent making more than kyr regardless of gender i wish i was in that average haha,1,NOT
one of my favorite points in debunking this myth is the one which states if women really are payed so much less than men then why would anyone ever hire a man spending  to  less on salaries would only be good business,2,NOT
vocal fry may undermine the success of young women in the labor market,2,NOT
how is vox still a thing,3,NOT
theres no gender wage gap its an earnings gap wage is the same for men and women they earn less or more if they work less or more hours,2,NOT
instead of solely focusing on making jobs more flexible why not adress the real issue get men to do  of work of raising their children they are not doing equal parental leave feeding bathing children taking them to doctors appointments etc,2,NOT
so the wage gap does exist just not in the same way we thought and its not necessarily fueled by direct sexism,1,NOT
do they miss the fact it doesnt exist,3,NOT
good video but the focus on well paying jobs misses the low paid occupations where discrepancies can mean real hardship especially in single parent households,2,NOT
its been illegal since the s to pay a woman less sure illegal things can happen because humans suck but dont you think the idea that companies on a national scale are breaking the law is a big claim to make,3,NOT
i hate the paper sound effects in this video,2,NOT
do you know what business school is they teach you how to run a business to get rich running a business you have to take risk men are biologically geared to take more risk then women its in our brain chemistry i bet if you were to see the statistic of how many men failed after graduating from business school the statics would look in favor of women because they are careful compared to most men,5,ABU
 it doesnt exist,3,NOT
id get through this video if i didnt have to hear your voice and your grunting,3,NOT
the wage gap only happens because men work more dangerous jobs get jobs that are more successful such as engineering while woman are more likely to work in fashion also men work more overtime than women,5,ABU
there is no wage gap,3,NOT
the video correctly points out the disproportional amount of time women spend on child rearing duties some of these duties are dictated by nature pregnancy breast feeding etc to the extend that the gap in the remaining duties can be closed i would say this women who are bothered by this gap should choose partners that are on board with a  split in those duties but please spare us any grand social engineering schemes that try to correct this imbalance at a societal level,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
fun fact women entering the workplace lowered wages for everybody,2,NOT
the think people look over is that theres not one,2,NOT
im disappointed that you didnt mention the affects of race on the gender pay gap,2,NOT
why is everyone a moronfeminist say that women earn less a hour doing the same job as a man does ex both work at a job earning  a hour and they all think women will make  instead thats what the wage gap is to feminists just fyi if you want to complain that there is a wage gap when youre a cashier and you compare your salery to a ceo of a company then that might be the reason why you work as a cashiercause youre a idiot,3,NOT
does anybody know the music they used in the background,1,NOT
what people miss is that is people dont get payed differently for the same work,1,NOT
what is the pay difference for men and women who work for themselves,1,NOT
the  cent for every dollar a man makes has been debunked for decades women choose to go into lower paying fields than men when you look at the top  paying fields of study at university men dominate  out of  there are a majority of women in only  field of study and thats pharmacology  female  malebarely a majority when you look at the bottom  paying fields women dominate  out of  fields psychology sociology early childhood education etc guess what folks a petroleum engineer makes more than a kindergarten teach or a social worker this video also glosses over evolutionary differences between men and women and how we evolved the gap exists in business more because men are more aggressive not only are they more likely to ask for a raise but they are also more likely to push hard for sales women use different tactics often looks and sexuality in business specifically sales ill likely be called sexist for pointing out these facts but feel free to research them yourselves and ask any questions there is a pay gap between men and women for doing the same job but its about  men also work an average of  hours more per week so women work fewer hours and tend to spend more time with their kids single women age  who dont have kids earn  more than their male counterparts why is this fact never discussed the truth is that men and women go into different fields mainly because of evolutionary biology its why african americans are only  of the population but are  of the nba is it racist to say that on average a black man can jump higher and run faster than a white or asian man or is this accepted because it is not a negative either way its a fact that cannot be disputed by science,5,ABU
you know why they are payed less cause if we are on a titanic and its sinking women and children get to leave first,3,NOT
two my teachers are on maternitythats the wage gap,3,NOT
cmon vox youre on the right trackish but what a terrible summary basically  wage gap isnt as black and white as people think it is its more that society is still aimed at women being primary caregivers and men being breadwinners so the opportunities they have are different  its not a case of paying equal wage for same jobhours because thats not the issue the solution is to start having better procedures in place for maternity leave  less discrimination against females around the age they have kids  more men taking paternity leave etc you kinda touched on it a bit but i feel like you spent too much time going indepth into the studies instead of talking about the theory of it which is a pretty big part of the research itself,2,NOT
you do not want to close the wage gap the reason you have it is because you are using an average in the calculation which is not something you should ever do with a trinomial distribution the average is based on the whole male and female population and does not take into account that you have three distinct different groups low income earners medium income earners and high income earners and you have a difference between the male and female demographics in these three groups this is what causes the wage gap for example just to illustrate this say that the low income is k aud the average wage in oz is k aud a year an high income is k a year we set that to be exactly the same for both men and women then we place  of women in low pay jobs  or women in medium paid jobs and  in high pay jobs for men we set  in low pay jobs  in medium paid jobs and  in high paid jobs now we calculate the average women   k    k    k   a year men   k    k    k   a year wage gap       difference     so the wage gape is about  in this example note here that the wages are identical for all men and women the only thing that differs is the number of males and females in each group so if you want to close this wage gap you can do that in  ways  all people get the same wage irrespective of job this is communism and state controlled wagesetting  we demand the same number of men and women in all jobs in society this is again state control over who get to work where and again communism we have over  years of data based on communism it doesnt work and leads to tyranny this is why we dont want to close the wage gap because the way to do it tyrannical,3,NOT
you earn the same money for the same job whats the point of hiring men since the companies bottom line is profit and its way cheaper to hire women,2,NOT
it doesnt matter this video provided factual evidence to explain why things are the way they are but some if not the majority of feminists are just going to ignore this video per usual and say the typical we make less because we are women and men are at fault for everything,2,NOT
so its the babies that are sexist i knew it all along,2,NOT
im not the kind of guy to try and force my beliefs upon others so only read if youre interested but i feel like some guys get caught up on this sort of women are being greedy or selfimportant or just want to criticise men sort of view and like yes there is a small percent of jerks who will confirm that stereotype but i also think its silly that so many guys act like it is a hit to there pride to acknowledge that there may be some male favouritism going on i really feel like that isnt necessary here is my beliefs at least i want everyone to have an equal shot at things if there seems to be some cultural favouritism or discrepancy in equality that is correctable we should strive for fixing it whether searching for furthered equality helps me or not i will support it because i would hope that others support support me in times that dont benefit them were all just kicking about on this planet lets not forget were all the same,1,NOT
can we please start labeling this entire topic lifetime earnings gap so we can save some suffering and confusion maybe then we can actually start figuring out how to compensate people in unquantifiable work aka sharing and caring jobs,2,NOT
my wife makes more than x what i make wheres my equal pay,3,NOT
theres not a wage gap theres an earning gap women earn less cause they work less take more vacation take off due to children etc,3,NOT
to sum this up men are generally more able to take on the schedules that pertain to higher paying jobs than women because women are more likely to be caught up taking care of a child in their s or s,3,NOT
hmm so my military experience schooling and various community dealings should account for nothing in regards to my payscale i suppose the way i see it is the men are almost always doing the manual labor positions they are the primary individuals fighting wars and i respect the fact that this video didnt come off as how i initially thought it would,5,ABU
wait correct me if im wrong but at the end did she say the way to end the wage gap you will have to give people more time off,2,NOT
i bet all the dislikes are from feminazis,3,NOT
one are you saying you dont pay your workers equal pay two i read both documents and the study never redoes any of the experiments making them have a chance of being false three why would companys hire men if they can pay women less,2,NOT
most women who works in business sector i know actually doesnt have problem with work hours most women just prefer not to go into the higher executive offices because it is very stressful,2,NOT
more like earnings gap if women want to do same amount of money they should work the same amount same goes for men ofc aka same job same time same year same efficiency and so on you cant compare a butcher to an rocket scientist and say this is an unfair wage gap,3,NOT
lefties never take into account that these stats dont show how women and men choose different jobs and may have different qualifications according to pue in the top  cities in the usa when women and men have the same jobs and the same qualifications women earn more than men argument over,3,NOT
so we need to change the world to fit the ideals of women as opposed to leaving women to change to fit the ideals of the world that sounds efficient business owners will love this,3,NOT
i liked the explanation but think she should have included why the wage gap in the tech field is almost non existent as she said it has a lot to do with hours of availability and with many jobs in the tech field having the option to wfh at least part of the time it saves trips into the office i found wfh is great as long as you make sure to get out and do something during the day as well it doesnt really matter what just as long as one makes sure to leave home for a while otherwise motivation burnout begins to set in,1,NOT
you think this is a godd explanation but there is alot of info you leave oute that idont know  when you say men get  and wimmen get  but you need more info than that edjucation like you state  is this per houer or at the end of the year then if men work  houers in a set time and wimmen work  houers i that same set time is this gap not fair  now i dont know the stats but the fair way of paying someone is not by the houer but by the work so if men does more work in less time but work the same time as wimmen it is only logical that men gets more if they get more work done same if wimmen does more wokr is the same time that men do then wimmen must get more i wil only cal it equalety when someone can say that wimmen and men get the same kind of money for moving this bag of stuf from point a to point b no matter the time it takes you get a set amount of money when the work is done this is fair and until someone can say that men get more for the same job that took the same amount of time if they then get more then the system is not fair then it is fair to pay the guy more if he does it faster depending on the job cus sometimes if you does something a litle slower take your workd and deliver it to someone that then have to do work on it the slower eatch point in the cahain is the slower the total work is done,2,NOT
flexible hours would be good for everyone men and women but heres a bright idea how about if men got off their lazy asses and started taking care of their kids and doing household chores just a thought,3,NOT
well woman were made to please man takes out some popcorn,3,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist otherwise employers would only hire women boom refuted,3,NOT
 times now ive seen the newest mcdonalds ad and you know mcdonalds is out of ideas for their happy meals when you hear a kid say i got the lamp,1,NOT
not necessarily a wage gap issue but the cost of being a woman is higher than the cost of being a man just look at deodorant prices for example,2,NOT
its more about marketable skills and availability then about discrimination of gender even in the selfemployed area men tend to make more than there female counterparts,2,NOT
ok sure mabye the wage gap has more to do with personal choice but if we look at the  highest paying majors in elite schools  of them have a leading male public and when u see the  least paying majors  have a female public the statement this research makes is that biology makes women more into emotional stuff like social work and psicology while men are more interested in mechanical work so when we look at this in terms of career choices of course men pick the higher paying career paths not necessarily because of the money but its what they like and what theyre good at and what is really being siad here is that the reason why mechanical work is higher paying than social work is because we value mens work a lot more than we do womens,2,NOT
no one cares men deserve more,5,ABU
prageru does a great video on it too,3,NOT
did you consider sex worker jobs which is totally in favour of women no you didnt women dont pay for sex men do that covers for the gap anyways,3,NOT
so yea the gap gets smaller in their s and s you mean right when everyone is retiring and going onto benefits,2,NOT
its doesnt exist,2,NOT
this channel shows clear leftwing bias,2,NOT
yes men are better at earning money then women,5,ABU
vox was a different place in ,1,NOT
so stop calling it a wage gap and start calling it an earnings gap,2,NOT
wage gap isnt real,3,NOT
its interesting how even after taking everything into consideration there is still a gap and this gap is shown to be something for women to be grateful for like yeah its only a  gap so yall feminists better sit yo ass down why is there any gap why is everyone rejoicing saying that theyve got the feminists there shouldnt be a gap,2,NOT
the answer is simple stop having children,2,NOT
i mean sure its not good i guess that women on average make less but its not my fault as a male theres no conspiracy that every man is in on saying yeah we gotta pay women less cause theyre women muhaha,3,NOT
what about the homeless bias women are much less homeless than men i think you should cover this,2,NOT
if women get paid less than men wouldnt all companies fire as many male employees as possible and replace them with women so they can enjoy huge economical benefits,3,NOT
i want to know if the overall estimate is based on harder working jobs and higher up jobs,2,NOT
men make more money than women on average but thats only because the very top successful men have enough money to cover up the unsuccessful men the overwhelming majority of the homeless population are men the overwhelming majority of plumbers landscapers garbage truck drivers mailmen and construction workers low paying jobs are almost all male dominated women actually occupy most of the median jobs in society and yes a big reason for the wage gap is that men ask for raises more than women but if you look at the statistics men are significantly fired more than women because they take those risks additionaly there is biology to consider successful men will almost always have options to female partners while unsuccessful men will have much less females do not need to be successful or accomplished to be desired by men so there is less of a demand for it just because the numbers arent the same doesnt mean there is a great injustice being perpetuated by a grand evil superpower think with your brain not your heart,2,NOT
actually its all women and all men including those that dont work it also doesnt factor in anything from maternal leave to hours worked to length of career the study is just a statistic of what every woman in the us earns averaged out vs what ever man in the us earns averaged out including those that make billions and those that dont earn a nickle factoring those in tends to result in a lot of fields where women are payed vastly more than men perhour,2,NOT
if companies pay women less than men why dont said companies only hire women to save money,2,NOT
ye but men dont take tasks for their tasks because you cant when i was younger my dad couldnt come to my matches or to the store with me because his boss didnt let him he let woman working with him do so but not men of cource men are going to get more money if they cant leave work to spend time with their children he couldnt be with me most weekends so of course he got more money if mens jobs are less flexible then they are going to work more therefore gain more,2,NOT
reality check doesnt exist,3,NOT
if you look at the  richest people in the world there are all men why because they are actually doing stuff to make money they arent trying to euthanize all guys because apparently if only women were on earth everything would be equalutopian the truth is backed up by many biologists women tend to want to take care of the childrenand they tend to want more time off because a guy works harder then a women does not mean he earns more than women stop taking bullshit theories about how you guys think the world should be and stop making  minute long explanations about them that tell you nothing other than there were studies done to show xy and z truth is researchers often cut corners when they need to get work done so they didnt take the time to pull out all the data necessary to tell you the truth they made an average salary means that more men went into those jobs out of the gate for reasons only those business men and women know about simple fact is the wage gap is bullshit because its a cherry picked problem made up by leftists to try to make the world better when its not possible to make it better than it already is in america side note if a women thinks she is getting paid less there are courts to sue the company for to get equal pay its not that employers are paying you less its that your paying yourself less women,3,NOT
what about the age based wage gap older people make way more than younger people im sure its much larger than a  cents on the dollar difference how is this fair,2,NOT
what happened to your snapchat thing,1,NOT
basically the wage gap statistics didnt consider many factors like working hours and choices of industries and many more so the  thing is fake,2,NOT
of course i can sum this up in a sentence the wage gap isnt real,3,NOT
really i can pay women less for the same work im gonna only hire women no you cant pay women less than men for the same work and experience time and the same job its already law,2,NOT
so in other words if men do more chores women will have more time in work then shell get paid more,1,NOT
the weird thing is if you really got to pay women less than men even if they had the same amount of experience work productivity etc there would be companies willing to hire way more women than men cheaper labor also you never hear the companies that are supposedly paying women so much less than men why because it doesnt really exist again men generally choose fields that pay more than fields that are dominated by women men and women simply make different career choices because shockingly men and women are different,3,NOT
there is no wage gap there is actually a pay gap,2,NOT
i know feminists wish it still existed because they are still protesting for it,2,NOT
if the wages arent enough get a job where there is,2,NOT
the wage gap even how theyre explaining it should be changed in definition because theyre explaining why women dont as a whole get as much as men theres not enough women in that field theres no prejudice within companies like that today in first world countries,3,NOT
ahh its so typical for these feminatzis to bring up responsibility in the home this is literally a decision two people make together are woman some how forced to be more caring to their children whose forcing them to be more scheduled the husbands its so usless to throw in this fact,3,NOT
anyone else see ice cream taster as one of those high quality jobs that can lower the wage gap,3,NOT
because it doesnt factor in the fact that women work less hours,2,NOT
i didnt think it was possible for box to make a video that was educational in politics,2,NOT
sexism no longer exists on a legal or societal scale in the united states anymore why dont you new age feminists who claim to care sooo much about women protest and draw attention to the plight of women being forced into polygamous marriages in the middle east every minute why dont you campaign for the children being sold as sex slaves or the women in saudi arabia who cannot legally drive a car or even open a bank account without a male relatives permission draw attention to actual problems women are facing in the world instead of making up problems that dont exist so you can pull the victim card the patriarchy doesnt exist its a boogeyman feminists blame for their problems so they dont have to take responsibility for their own actions,3,NOT
i like where she says this is factually correct  no it isnt ,3,NOT
i appreciate this take on the issue,1,NOT
exactly what thomas sowell said in the s  nothing new  but great video ,1,NOT
these pieces are always the same concentrating on high earning high qualification jobs earnings for the average joe or josephine in the usa is what around k to k per year,2,NOT
why does every last word in her sentences sounds like a cat with influenza,3,NOT
hey you guys this is fake news,3,NOT
thing is when people hear about that  to  ratio they think that women just straight get paid less if you were to compare a man with the same job and experiences who puts in the same amount of hours as the woman its literally been illegal since  for people to get differing wages like that lol,3,NOT
but its not real,2,NOT
lets just say without feeling ashamed men are better than women when it comes to getting work done male brain is more logical and focused thats why they are good with machines and computers whereas female have a random  acc to me its confusing mindset thought pattern and they prefer jobs require less mental work and risk its not like women are less than men its just the nature both are different women can be a substitute to a men but she cant be a men,5,ABU
why do people think they can do these little surveys and make a huge and mostly missleading conclusions their are simply too many variables that effect the results in a large way that have not even been concidered in a simple physics expirement that might have  controlled variables you still need to be pretty spot of to get even close to the theoretical values with the practical aspects to really have an accurate surveys you would need to take into account almost everything like qualifications if your comparing something like running a business its even more difficult this is what happens when you teach the socialists statistics,2,NOT
women and men earn the same amount of money for the same job in the same amount of work time period,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that women dont actually get paid less,2,NOT
you have just explained that people who arnt available for a pm meeting because they have a kid to take care of get paid less than people that are more available either dont have kids or get your husband to do the chores both options that a woman and man have the choice to make whats the point of this wage gap conversation it basically says that some people prioritize their career over their family,3,NOT
 equal pay act look it up,2,NOT
you forgot to mention that men are expected to work longer hours so over a day we earn more and were more likely to die at work yay,2,NOT
tldr the fact that its fake,3,NOT
 most of those jobs dont have a potential to have flexible hours image a doctor or a firefighter  nope im gonna take a break now,2,NOT
the top  richest people in america are men these men would highly inflate the wage gap,1,NOT
lolol i saw you sneak in professional stick figure artist at the end great video tho you forgot to mention that the wage gap for single women is  basically nothing,2,NOT
to be honest the thing about men most likely supporting a family is a stereotype and times are changing women are supporting families more and men are the women of the house,2,NOT
this is an important video there are a lot of emotions and identity politics at play when discussing the wage gap which causes it to become an all or nothing it exists or it doesnt debate if we can all stop breathe and acknowledge exactly what is causing this wage gap then we can find areas where it can be mitigated paternity leave is a good place to improve upon for example,1,NOT
 this message is really long and i hope the creators of this video will take out some minutes from their time to read it i genuinely think these are valid arguments and i promise this is not hate thank you and sorryfor the long comment well i guess its time to trap you in your own statistics vox as you mentioned about the job of a pharmacist you should that women earned  of what men did where is the other  as you mentioned that now there are more flexible hours and she can work on hours suitable so the variable of a kid is gone whether a woman has a kid or not so in theory according to you the wage gap should not exist between pharmacists but it does so what could possibly be the reason of the missing  another thing in the statistics you showed about different types of jobs tech business and one other it is true that tech has a shrinked up wage gap but i most certainly saw some green dots on the middle range too if a woman is doing her job completing experiments and whatever else is done on labs then why are there some positions in the tech itself that have an existing wage gap now going on to the study of mba students the one between  and  now this time most variables are same the women have the exact same qualifications as the men and is most cases even the same age as men so now tell me even after that why are woman paid  less than men yes the wage gap is considerably less in this scenario and that is really great but why is there a difference at all this all is regardless whether a woman has a kid or not or even married after all you showed us the statistics of difference of wage gap between woman who have kids and woman who do not agreed that there was a considerable difference but then again the column of women who do not have kids was not zero why not this time there is clear indication that having kids is not the prime reason of women being paid less than men so my final question is if this is clearly not the prime reason then what is,2,NOT
wait until the care for elderly parents hits the graph,2,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap is that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
i miss the gender pay gap because now women get paid more than a man for less overall work,2,NOT
there is no wage gap people just simply have different jobs and different promotion,2,NOT
this video missed the information about women who have never been married actually earn a bit more on average this is known since the s at least according to michael sowell,2,NOT
well also that women are more expensive to keep at a workplace than men,3,NOT
many women choose to have children some dont exactly choose ofc depending on the situation but its seems very clear that the wage gap is a natural occurance due to the differences between men and women equality of opportunity does not always equal a mean equality of outcome thats not a nessisarily a bad thing men and women are different and thats the end of it be proud of your gender and strive to do well,2,NOT
so we need to figure out a way to plan jobs so that women have more time for themselves,2,NOT
so basically the wage gap mainly comes from the number of hours worked thus the main cause of the wage isnt sexism,2,NOT
here is an other idea too in divorce the higher wage earner should get custody of the kids think of what is best for the children,2,NOT
wow its almost like if you take out the impact of certain life choices than it is almost entirely gone,2,NOT
if it was real woman would have more money because woman are cheaper than men so if if did happen men would be unemployed across the country,2,NOT
why does it seem there arent enough females in ceo positions etc let me explain simply in the work place if you want to get to the highest position possible you have to make sacrifices you cannot have everything your way its impossible you have to begin to work extremely long hours to get to the top which means you sacrifice your free time family time etc males are more willing to do this than females in general males dont have it all so why do feminists think they can males have to sacrifice their family time and free time etc because they may be travelling around the world a lot as part of their job women are natural caregivers and most females in general want to start a family because they have a limited of time to have babies women typically want more balance in their life they dont want to be juggling a high profile job family life and other responsibilities think about it thats alot of work for one person  especially considering how much work you need to put in if you have to raise a family it isnt easy for females because theyre natural caregivers and they typically tend to be more involved with family anyway  for example looking after the children taking them to school etc feeding them etc hence why women take on more part time roles and hence why the gender wage gap statistics are misleading if you work part time you earn less than a full time worker  fact women were actually happier in the s because they didnt have the responsibilities of having to work high profile jobs look after the home look after the kids like more women may be experiencing today furthermore another reason that explains why there arent more women in high profile positions is because of competitiveness and personality females are competing not only with females but males too males are naturally and evolutionary more competitive due to their natural dominant traits so having to compete with other females and other males isnt exactly easy females typically have an agreeable personality unlike males in general what this means is females are less likely to disagree with something and be vocal about it in general if females want to succeed in these types of environments and get promotedearn more money they must take on these male traits competitiveness and dominance women must sacrifice a portion of their femininity in order to gain equality of outcome just like men would have to sacrifice their masculinity otherwise known as toxic masculinity to feminist sjws in order to create equality of outcome desired by feminists feminists dont understand that having both a mother and father in a high profile job that requires lots of working hours requires time away from their kids whos lives are gonna get affected the kids they are missing out on family time and its going to affect how they are raised because their parents may be too busy working to give them attention and the care  thus potentially resulting in the children to grow up unnaturally independent and not unattached to their parents distant to conclude im generalising here so dont comment saying i can manage because youre a minority which i acknowledge hence why i said in general,5,ABU
im here for the comments,1,NOT
well yeah einstein of course you get paid less if you work lesswhy do you make a video about such a simple thing,2,NOT
screw the fem movement put on your bra and get in the kitchen,5,ABU
the wage gap is gone now,2,NOT
so why call it a gender wage gap as opposed to a when are you available to work wage gap,2,NOT
 of the people who disliked are angry feministsthe other  are idiotssad but true,3,NOT
so this video literally just proved that the wage gap myth doesnt exist its all based on hours,2,NOT
minute  you say that men earn k on average while women earn  less at k hope it was an honest mistake and not trying to sound more alarming than it already is the correct answer is  less,1,NOT
here is how we can fix this false accusation of gender wage have all men work as interns,2,NOT
what your geting paid,1,NOT
a woman stays at home and she is a housewife a guy stays at home and he is a deadbeat,2,NOT
guys do you know how do they make these statistics i mean do they put in consideration the type of jobs the extra hours etc,1,NOT
thanks sarah very informative,1,NOT
where i come from we dont have this problem cause our society is built on families rather than on individuals you live with your parents and contribute in the house money but still everyone has his own money and own property you leave your parents house when you are ready to start your own family and both partners contribute in the house money and it is the same for men and women,1,NOT
if there was a wage gap i would hire  of women so the company gets more profit so the wage gap isnt entirely truefeminists are outta control ik vox isnt feminist i debunked one part of the wage gap but most if not all is true,2,NOT
jesus these comments are a mess the video is implying that the primary solution lies in incentivizing businesses to give more flexible working hours which is something that can narrow the earnings gap and potentially be better for everyone you dont have to be a diehard feminist to see the logic here in the standard household where women work but also take on a bit more responsibility for childcare the option of say a  shift for mothers means that they can better align their working schedule with childcare it also gives more flexibility to work ot,1,NOT
if companies can get away with paying women less then why dont they fire all men and hire only women up to  of a companys expense are salaries,2,NOT
accurate until about the  second mark a new record,2,NOT
notice how the gap in pay jumped up in the ssomething big must of happened then whispers equal pay act of  also people need to note that jobs do not have equal amount of men or womenmeaning theres mostly men in the tech field theres mostly women in nursing theres mostly men on oil rigs or theres mostly women social workers with each field paying differently there should of been a comparison of same jobs from the same companies as different companies do pay different salaries for different jobs when the initial survey or study was done,2,NOT
where did yall go to find a firefighters hours be flexible thats either a amam shift or a pmpm shift  hour shift are not what most would call flexible,1,NOT
lol this comment section is everyone triggering everyone,1,NOT
i have yet to find an employer who would pay me  more than the women until laws are changed they are required to pay me more for being a man but the women are still getting paid equal to or more than me,1,NOT
vox loves to put out liberal propaganda the market is efficiently regulating wages as necessary further even if it wasnt that implies a great opportunity to fix it via the freemarket as an employer would take advantage of lower waged women who as suggested produce equal output government intervention is not necessary in addition to this im extremely skeptical of anything a liberal says after all at first it was just the  per dollar claim liberalism is a pack of lies starting with the misuse of the term liberal,2,NOT
im sorry but its not correct women dont work as long and dont go to higher paying jobs,3,NOT
one of the most insightful things ive seen about the wage gap great video,1,NOT
vox is just a leftwing propaganda machine,3,NOT
if you are a woman how is the wage gap affecting you if the issue is that women do more unpaid work like taking care of their children because they want to then how does that affect you as an individual if a wife and husband decide that the husband is going to do the unpaid housework and childcare from now on the woman will be earning more than him tldr the woman prefers to do the housework the gap wont affect her if she solves the housework problem with her partner,3,NOT
this is my opinion if you want the wage gap to disappear then work harder for it work for longer take more shifts men on average work harder and longer for more times during the week thats why men gain more money thank you for not freaking out about it like it ruined your life and instead kept your cool,3,NOT
its just too complicated to fully understand i want everything to be fair but am just not sure about whats wrong and right,1,NOT
if a woman doesnt like the idea of taking the time and energy and making the sacrifices to raise her own kids why have them if it happens anyway there are so many couples would happily take and raise them that there is no problem there but if she has bought into the idea that she must have it all or else she must resent all men and if making as much or more money as her husband is more important then pay someone else to raise them  or me and i mention the husband because the video does daycare workers will never love or treat those children like their own and they come and go so the sense of abandonment starts young and telling them they shouldnt feel it is about the adults feelings not theirs ever heard the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world in case you need that spelled out it means that the person who spends the most time with and talking toguiding children is the one who actually raises them not the one who simply houses them pays the bills eats dinner with them  if even that and gives the biggest gifts he or she develops the closest relationship and passes on their values and beliefs and thus naturally has the greatest influence on what the kids will do with their lives  thus that person becomes the hand im old enough to have seen many many outcomes of both ways and theres no going back or doovers and no amount of sorrys change things so we made the choice to be the ones to love and raise ours and id be that hand who was there knowing the financial challenges and i am so glad we did it was worth every struggle and thats what i tell them  you are worth more than any amount of money i could have made yes kids raised by others usually still love their parents but when talking with them many wistfully and with repressed guilt say they wish they could have had something like what we did for ours but that theyd never tell their mom because it would just make her feel bad so they carry the painful burden quietly kids have enough pain in this world so why add to it if its for a point of pride for the philosophy a choice to be financially richer and have more stuff  at their expense my boss and coworkers would not remember me long after i am gone would not likely be there for me when i am old and feeble and need help or visit me regularly if i am in hospital send cards call or text or put flowers on my grave id never imagine being a stereotypical passiveaggressive guilt mom who overtly or subtly makes them feel bad for holding me back and being the reason i couldnt achieve my feminist dream whoa nice thing to pass onto your kids eh oh and if this guilttrips you at least you are an adult and can handle it better than a child,3,NOT
the gender wage gap does not exist,2,NOT
have you ever thought that maybe some women would rather take care of children,2,NOT
if the wage gap exists why would any reasonable company hire men if women could do the same work for less the answer the gap doesnt exist,3,NOT
is this announcer practicing her npr voice,3,NOT
 when i heard factually correct i puked,3,NOT
lol gender wage gap is fake because if women got payed less than men for the same job theyd fire all the men,3,NOT
gender pay gap in modelling industry sees women earn  more than men supply and demand folks its not a conspiracy,2,NOT
woooh sarah kliff lay some knowledge on me,1,NOT
ever thought men work harder than women ever thought maybe the man had been working there for longer than the women,3,NOT
feminists will hate this truth bomb lol,3,NOT
the wage gap doesnt even exist mate,2,NOT
funny how all the liberal wage gap blaring feminists i know are baristas at starbucks or waitresses working towards a career as a low paying social worker where are all the female engineers and lawyers complaining that they dont make the money of their coworkers,2,NOT
until women want to become doctors instead of sell makeup and hairdressers in the mall there will always be a wage gap,2,NOT
oh look vox made a decent video  years ago now it is leftist propaganda,2,NOT
theres no gap if you work the same hours doing the same job youll get paid the same youre complaining that you get paid less for working less,2,NOT
what happens if the the wage gap flips and men start earning less money then women,1,NOT
misleading in percentage misleading in pay coefficient seriously this is a coeffient you dont do it  that means you multiply by  one simple wayto  not this bullshit gap is mostly due to men better qualification and women working lesshardworking due to ding ding ding less muscle tissue lowleve jobs heres your gap mam,5,ABU
this is actually a pretty fair treatment of the gender wage gap the disparity certainly does exist but its cause is rooted primarily in the different life decisions men and women make namely child care as this video suggests  not misogyny which is what many mainstream feminists would have us believe,2,NOT
so in short the wage gap is produced not by discrimination but by the choices that women make,2,NOT
that the wage gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
i listened to this with an open mind hoping to learn something new about the socalled pay gap that i may have in fact been missing i had been under the impression that the gap is a myth but was looking to hear other explanations as to why it persists all i learned from watching this video is that its creators seem to take issue with the fact that women have choices and that they choose different paths in life that men do not and in some cases cannot this is why i cant support modern feminism as it is most often expressed in the mainstream its a bunch of women shaming men for being men and shaming women for daring not to devote themselves to the corporate rat race and instead choosing to focus on their homes and families feminists have created deep confusion and unhappiness in several generations of men and women but especially women who i am finding feel increasingly pressured to achieve while at the same time being keenly aware that their youth and fertility are slipping away those that do have children feel guilty and ashamed for being away from their children in order to work while simultaneously feeling resentment that they are spending the bulk of their time caring for another human being and staying at home with each passing day i grow more and more disillusioned with feminism because i see the misery and internal conflict it is causing constantly ive come to the conclusion that feminists only care about themselves they care about being seen to fight for a cause they care about proselytizing and spreading their feminist faith to the masses but they do not care about women,3,NOT
there is no wage gap women just pick jobs that dont pay as much,3,NOT
they say a womans work is never done thats why they get paid less,3,NOT
so change the way the whole economy works to make our choices which we made freely more profitable gotcha,2,NOT
god damn it i cant believe my history teacher in high school fooled me into believing this if it simply compares median incomes then its a joke of a comparison women need to realize that men are still slightly better than them overall and worry about their individual selves women were never meant to outclass men their primary focus should be to develop the skills and habits that they can pass onto their children to offset their lower income,5,ABU
theres too many women that are willing to live off men,2,NOT
this chanel is a complete fake news full of democrats and proabortion people you should be ashamed by the type of america you are defending you left people want to turn the us into a socialist country dont you see what socialism has made it destroyed countries make america great again,3,NOT
the  cents to a dollar stat is only true if you compare apples to oranges overall if more librarians are women and more men are firefighters that means a man on average will earn more because firefighters tend to earn more but if you compare the wages of men who are firefighters to women who are also firefighters or any other profession the wage gap turns out to be a lot less than  cents to a dollar so it is false to claim women earn  cents to a dollar doing the same work as a man politifact has rated such statements by politicians as false i really wish this video had made this point clearer,2,NOT
men were earning k while women were earning  percent less  k vox you are just making the whole misrepresentation worse  is  lower than  im sure  sounds much more convenient for you to make a point and surprise people but this is something that is taught in primary school  is  lower than   is  higher than  please dont try to educate people if you cant or dont want to get even this right,2,NOT
maybe the fact that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
sooooo what you are saying is that men are more flexible with regards to their working hours and that when a job demands flexibility people who are flexible are rewarded men are flexible for work women want flexibility from work how could that gap ever be closed ultimately should it even be,2,NOT
the statistic also doesnt show that men work more hours,2,NOT
men are more likely to have a dependent spouse men are far harder hit by divorce than women women get far more government assistance than men men are more likely to be homeless than women as both the government and relatives are far more likely to help women in poverty tell me again about womens problems,3,NOT
the example she showed with the  cuisines people and man and a woman i think straight off the bat thye should earn the same wages there was a  dollar gap in the beginning of their careers,2,NOT
so we all need to go to pharmacy school,1,NOT
wait this is vox wtf i thought they were hardcore liberals,2,NOT
oversimplified pharmacist is a bad example because they tend to all do the exact same thing so its easy to justify earning what your peers earn meanwhile a scientist or business persons position could take on a whole range of possible responsibilities and niches some with more earning potential than others so if the pharmacists wage gap is  then theres your argument proving there is a wage gap,1,NOT
 year out of business school lol,1,NOT
the wedge gap does not exist,2,NOT
its not mens fault you were a fat kid coming up its not mens fault that you couldnt never get a boyfriend for prom like all the pretty girls its not mens fault you look like a troll its not mens fault you turn to homosexuality just to find acceptance its not mens fault that youre an ugly loser my point is only ugly girls complain about gender equality but dont blame men for your shortcomings,5,ABU
maybe women stay at home to look after children because it makes sense too since they earn less ,3,NOT
well the whole gender pay gap is fake it has been debunked so many times,3,NOT
i think in order to fix the wage gap people need to forget what they know about the wage gap there are more factors that go into it than we initially think or see its complicated just like any other issue,1,NOT
wow vox i was honestly surprised at how unbiased this was i clicked it groaning thinking oh great a feminist propaganda piece  color me surprised,1,NOT
did anyone else find the chart at  really hard to understand,1,NOT
wow a non bias vox video,1,NOT
what about the child support gap women get  more than men,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that it doesnt exist at all,2,NOT
must be true cause the have graphs and while mothers do more house work  of work related deaths are male you want equality stop being carers and get a dangerous job,3,NOT
question  is it true that in study after study when identical resumes are submitted for open jobs the resumes with male names at the top get far more callbacks ,1,NOT
men are far more likely to die on the job i say that worth  cents,2,NOT
wish you would have mentioned the choices people make,1,NOT
i thought the thing that people miss about the wage gap was going to be that women of color are paid less than white women it would have been interesting to see that factored in to this angle,1,NOT
maybe woman will stop complaining and do work then they will get paid equally easy problem solved,3,NOT
there is not a gender wage gap it is a federal crime to discriminate against people based on their sex there is a gender earnings gap which closes to almost nil when one accounts for types and concentrations of education and time invested into careers but lets look at it this way if women are paid less than men for the same amount of work why in the world would anyone ever hire a man when they could get an equal amount of work out of a woman for  of the cost,3,NOT
finally a vox video that makes sense,1,NOT
having a gap doesnt automatically make it wrong or discriminatory lots of choices going on in one of the freest nations,1,NOT
the one thing people miss is that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
my mom was a teacher made almost more than all the men did,2,NOT
  of not  less the latter implies k rather than k all in all a good video aside from that part the videos content was sound,1,NOT
idk if in your countries is like that but in mine men oftenly promote other men to high positions just because they are drinking friends or stuff like that when women can be excellent bosses just as men,2,NOT
im offended it didnt include attack helicopter gender,2,NOT
the whole thing about the wage gap is that its talking about averages to examine an actual salary gap you have to look at it in specific fields not across all mediums because its very clear that if you just average out yearly earnings and divide one by the other youre going to get a very general image of reality the truth is while men have been encouraged to pursue wealth and success for themselves for decades if not centuries the same incentive wasnt true for women at least for a long time if not still and because of that many more women turn out to be stayathome parents or settle for small jobs less women in stem fields less women in big businesses less women in big roles not only because of a structurally sexist academic and professional universe but also because of it im sure there would be some difference most likely very significant if you were to compare a man and a woman in similar roles within the same company or across an entire field of work but it probably wouldnt be as latent as the wage gap weve grown accustomed to,2,NOT
both worked full time full time could mean anything from  to  hours per week,1,NOT
the reason women start making more as they grow up is because they are growing up and spending more time at work,2,NOT
the problem with the wage gap and other problems with equality is how people look at statistics im not sure what its up to now but the figure is around  that is that women on average across a lifetime earn about  of what a man earns on average across a lifetime when i see just that statistic i look at it and think thats an interesting statistic i wonder why that happens but the wage warriors and equality of outcome warriors look at it and think thats unequal thats a problem what are the horrible reasons for this occurring probably sexism i am going to prove its sexism,2,NOT
so this proves you get paid for the work you do and the wag gap is bs good video,2,NOT
 and  are not most peoples wages i dont think that statistic is very relivent,1,NOT
s feminists women are just as capable as men why shouldnt we be able to work s feminists you need to change the way we work so that it women can get paid as much,2,NOT
you dont take to account weather or not if females work the same hours or have the same priority than men workers,2,NOT
this is actually well done considering vox did it ultimately youve shown that more women need to pick better jobs and better education seriously why is is always in business business or nursing and its because of flexibility however heres the thing vox youve also shown that there is nothing wrong with an earnings gap if women want to take care of the kids fine its their choice some men are stay at home dads and that number has increased for a few years now if couples decide to have traditional households with women as the caretaker and home maker or if they want to swap roles thats totally their choice whatever the couple decides is their choice and there isnt any reason to persuade women to do anything other than pursue whatever they want to pursue,2,NOT
how is k  less than k ,1,NOT
about  thats the actual wage gap economists settled on when they took into consideration the different factors that lead to different incomes in the same jobs obviously it varies and it isnt absolutely equal however this article does a very good job of making it seem like the gap is still much bigger than that  when all of those factors are taken into consideration,1,NOT
this is actually pathetic,3,NOT
ha stupid feminists this video acknowledging from the start that the wage gap exists and having a frank discussion about the causes and nuances of the issue and how we should to approach changing it proves that the wage gap isnt real on a feminist channel no less but of course its just what weve all been saying for years if only those stupid sjws would stop hearing only what they want to hear there seems to be a lot of this in this comments,3,NOT
so youre saying people who work less get paid less alright,2,NOT
so whos working in the oil fields and coal mines,3,NOT
theres an earnings gap not a pay gap there is a earning gap because women on average do less hours and work less dangerous jobs,2,NOT
what people miss is if business owners could get the same work for less money from women then every business would have all women employees this is how you know this myth is and has always been a lie things are just that simple so stop lying and stop complicating truths that are just that simple,3,NOT
there is no different pay in australia just centerlink,2,NOT
i dont think the people who disliked this video actually watched it,1,NOT
lets force women to not child rear yeah right just leave it and forget it,2,NOT
 its illegal to pay a woman less than a man for the exact same job and vice versa  a lot of the difference in pay between men and women overall can be attributed to personal choice in careers  there are underlying biological and evolutionary factors at play when it comes to which careers men and women choose  none of this is bad,2,NOT
if you add all the factors such as the jobs men do then you will easily see that wage gap is not a thingalso its more common for females to stay home with there new born and take more time of then a man so simply adding all the factors up you can clearly tell wage gap is not a thing,3,NOT
women simply work less,2,NOT
wage gaps if they are real make sense the government expects married women to have a male with a job alongside them to add up to the total salary needed for the family and even if the male doesnt have a job it is a proven statistic men do better than women this means performance determines how much you earn for work not your gender,5,ABU
so you know its not a pay gap so why do you persist in mischaracterising it as such its an earnings gap plain and simple that is not something to correct it is perfectly correct already,2,NOT
one thing i ask is if women are payed less why dont more companies hire them to save money i mean wouldnt companies save money also as a female be assertive about the cash you want to fiercely compete with your fellow males it takes time but it works,3,NOT
pretty sure the wage gap is actually illegal under the equality act,2,NOT
women in my city make thousands of dollars a month babysitting or dogsitting not an exaggeration at all no college degree needed,1,NOT
pretending pharmacists work at am as a majority is hilarious this video is hilarious and the producer and writer have cancer,5,ABU
want to help eliminate the pay gap girls drop your gender studiesenglish lithistory major and take up engineering,2,NOT
wage gap doesnt exist earnings gap does exist though,2,NOT
bro in order to debunk anyone saying a wage gap is real just ask them if people could hire women and pay less then men  why do people hire men,2,NOT
man earn more but women are responsible for  of purchasing that means that man earn more but does not expend on his own what a patriarchy,2,NOT
unfortunately women take up more household related tasks because of children because there is a level of biology that plays a part in which preferences both genders have vox couldnt and wouldnt state this because it is deemed as somehow sexist and politically incorrect,5,ABU
this is a good and informational video,1,NOT
the wage gap between an attack helicopter and the samsung galaxy note  battery that exploded  months ago is gigantic its so sexist,2,NOT
i might sound ignorant but f it i refuse to believe that theres more than  genders people need to open there eyes and step into reality,5,ABU
misleading regarding the pharmacist job did the genderration change did the overall wage go down for the job,2,NOT
woman gets job at different employer that pays less than a man in the same job position at an employer that pays more thats sexist,2,NOT
its so badly conducted just think about it they justify the differing job work and pay they just say oh its all full time there,2,NOT
im still trying to figure out what average business major makes kyear,1,NOT
prototypical business woman venture capitalist roflmao,2,NOT
nice video just a comment that is entirely not related to the content but to the presentation your hands keep moving in an almost closed but weird way like a claw i know for most people this is stupid but i think a youtube video maker should try to improve every aspect of his videos besides that very good explanation ,3,NOT
wait it compares the median wage not the mean thats moronic the median is just the middle number value out of a large sample size it is not useful in comparing statistically the wages of men and women as it either underselling or overselling the differences because of it the median doesnt take any factors into account of the study sample and is just lazy to use,3,NOT
she is right about one thing women do work less than men due to children and stuff buts thats only natural if you look at it men would face the same thing if they took more of a house husband role too so the wage gap is basically created because women just take care of children more,2,NOT
so if  of women make more than their male counter parts arent you say men make less than women by  so there is no wage gap its all a myth do you even hear yourselves talk,3,NOT
before the video start i just want to say that the wage gap is a lie and that feminism is retarded,3,NOT
a whole  minute video to conclude by saying that women should get paid the same for working casual hours while men work full time nice one vox,2,NOT
vox back it again with the propaganda,3,NOT
women are clustered in lowpaying jobs or traditionally womens work is underpaid teachers caretakers,1,NOT
most people who went to college already knew this just look st hiw many women are in mathengineeringeconomics compared to health administrationpublic policybiologysocial scienceliberal arts,2,NOT
the wage gap is simply the difference in behavior and interest among men and women in very wide population samples unless the individual is discriminated against or limited i dont see why we should try to fix something which is only a result of peoples free choices the solution would be to trade individual freedom for a  equity number that looks good on paper but doesnt actually make anyone happier sounds like a double loss for everyone,2,NOT
what a bunch of mumbojumbo,3,NOT
if the wage gap is so real then why are men even hired if they have to get paid more,3,NOT
its statistically more common for men to work longer hours so thats why they get paid higher,3,NOT
i appreciate this study however most of the points it makes for reasons women do not work late is children the conservative side argues that women in general do not work longer hours before i accept this video at face value i would like to see the same study for women without children and see if the wage gap still exists there if it does your video might need some rethinking if it does not your video is legit and make sure the ages of the childless women are about the same as the ages of the women with children or the conservative side will argue that women tend to work harder at an earlier age and that the earlier aged men slack off more than their older counterparts have to have all bases covered,2,NOT
finally vox welcome to logic,2,NOT
in the same job if they do the same thing they are paid the same of course it wouldnt count on different jobs and a wage gap is how much they get on the same job in the same place earning gap is when you have less because you want more and you spend a lot compared to those who dont,2,NOT
when will this bs die off the differences are not existent when you take someone in the same profession working in the same part of the world to eliminate regional differences in pay and labors laws the feministics twist this truth to suit them by combining the earnings of all men and women without regard for age profession or any other factors obviously an engineer is going to earn more than a teacher and a doctor is going to earn more than them thats just how it is considering the fields men and women work in due to their own interests and dreams we find that women tend to work as teachers nurses etc which are not very high paying jobs but come with a social component and are much lighter on the workload men tend to take more stressful and dangerous jobs  ranging from mining sewage engineering offshore work and more they are obviously much more strenuous and dangerous to ones life and limb but are crucial for civilization to function hence their pay is equally large by explicitly avoid this piece of common sense these feminists are peddling lies openly and people still buy it its annoys me to no end that people are not using their brains even a little bit if you paid a doctor only as much as a regular office worker why would anyone go through the years long hell and massive risk to be a doctor same with engineers miners and so on,3,NOT
im sure its been said in the comments already but this is an earnings gap not a wage gap theres a world of difference between the two,2,NOT
the wage gap does not exist,2,NOT
that its not there,2,NOT
tldr anyone with an issue over this gap is either understand it or is to the extreme far left desiring not equality of opportunity but equality of outcome,2,NOT
so its caused by a legitimate disadvantage of having to take on the majority of child rearing that seems reasonable why is there so much vitriol and disbelief does anyone deny that having to care for a child takes effort that could otherwise be used towards a career and that that effort comes mostly from women i believe these statements to be true based on what ive observed and if they are true than it is obvious women have a disadvantage when it comes to having a business career leading to a wage gap it may not be true in your specific field but it is true in a general sense and we should work towards fixing it where we can,1,NOT
men and women earn the same money in all regulated industry if women get less money its because they do less work its as simple as that a real way of looking at the statistic at the beginning of the video is women on average only do  of the overall work that men do on average,2,NOT
what is this based vox im shook,2,NOT
and now for my final thought if this mythical wage gap exists its due to your personal irresponsibility kids divorce etc thats your problem dont make it societys problem its called birth control youre woman i hear you roar now let me see you work,5,ABU
what this fails to show is the fact the the other male half of the home is probably working  hours a day  days a week to provide for the family the woman is doing a disproportionate amount of home work well the man is doing a disproportionate amount of dangerous labor and working an aggressive overtime schedule stop blaming society for a problem that doesnt exist,3,NOT
responding purely to the title then leaving the page cause i dont need to listen to propagandistic bullshit so what is it that people miss about the wage gap the fact that it doesnt exist,3,NOT
solution dont get kids or go into a flexible job thank you vox,2,NOT
in other words men need to get off their lazy asses and help with chores and child rearing i can see the shitstorm this semiserious post creates already,2,NOT
one of the most factual and also most disliked vox videos ive seen guess the youtube anti sjws cant hear the word wage gap without being triggered into biting everything,2,NOT
vocal fry makes it impossible to watch this video,3,NOT
whats with the vocal fry ,3,NOT
personally this hurts my family my mom is in a great job the thing is shes a single mother and she raises me and my younger sister if we had a father more money would be rolling in and as my sister and i get older we also need more money only having one woman bringing in money for all three of us let alone our bills we also have a decently sized  story house doesnt sustain us enough and sometimes results in money being tight this is an issue for all women of all aspects many women work just as hard or even harder i hope i can grow up to work in an age where i can receive equal pay for the work im doing compared to a man,2,NOT
i shouldve gone to business school,1,NOT
im triggered bass drop,2,NOT
factual and informative video with cool animations literally the only reason i watch vox,1,NOT
lets talk about the college education gap women make  cents to the dollar of every man well for every  men that are accepted to college  women are in  and this discrepancy is specifically present at the higher ranked schools its a logical fallacy called the double standard critical thinking and taking a look at the whole picture is gravely neglected in this video just my two cents,2,NOT
honestly this is common sense they taught this at my school when we were  years old,1,NOT
theres also the part about the same job the same amount of work the same workplace people will often focus on this especially sjws yet they dint understand that if this is actually the case then what theyre doing has been illegal since  when president john f kennedy passed a law that stated that with the exception of raises it is illegal to pay anyone less or more than any other for the same amount of work in the same profession at the same workplace people often miss things like this however in   women went on trial for this law and approx  in  were deemed legitimate which still works after adding in false negatives and removing false positives,2,NOT
omg you guys are going to make me nut if you keep whispering sweet nothings into my ear like that,5,ABU
wage gap is a debunked myth,3,NOT
not true the wage talk was debunked by a business owner in ,3,NOT
on the business women point that is essentially an argument that women arent as good at managing businesses if im a ceo guess what i have to schedule my day around work whether im a man or a women and the less i do that the less successful im likely to be at running the business,2,NOT
nice to hear a coherent and nuanced discussion on the subject for a change they usually end up spouting such nonsence as women earn  less than men for the exact same work because patriarchy or run for the hills the feminazis ar coming,2,NOT
sorry sweetheart but if you dont work the same youre not getting payed the same this isnt a problem to be fixed and the workplace doesnt need to accommodate people who are less workoriented,3,NOT
its a career and schedule gap most men i know have there  hour shifts lets say  but usually leave closer to about  plus as a business owner would you really want to invest more in a man who can do good work well into his s and s or invest in a women who is required to have at least  months maternity leave whenever she has a kid which means you gotta pay to fill her position either overtime or a temp whos hourly wage is higher than everyone elses what if she decided to have a kid every year youll get sued for trying to fire her plus at their s and s women go through menopause which studies done by women asking other women have shown that menopause reduces their productivity in the work place if you hire a  year old man for  years you get  good years of work if you hire a  year old woman for  years assuming she has  kids you get   years of work plus you get  months to  years of sub par menopause work hiring women is bad business,5,ABU
why do all feminist look alike hmmm,2,NOT
for wage gap you need to find a man and a woman with the exact same qualifications and exact same working hours in the exact same job and compare them,2,NOT
finally some common sense vox you can be hit or miss sometimes but there is a reason i stay subbed thanks for all the info i appreciate it,1,NOT
v o c a l f r y,3,NOT
its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,2,NOT
all i got from this video is the reality that the wage gap is a myth in the respect of people paying men more on purpose in reality women choose less paying jobs and easier hours and take more parental roles,2,NOT
oh boy here comes the right,2,NOT
why try to make jobs more flexible instead of making men care for children more wtf,2,NOT
expect its illegal to under pay women but whatever,2,NOT
high end high demanding lawyer firms struggle to keep women as their employees because women usually marry someone of equal social status and higher they often have a husband who makes about the same as they do plenty of money these are jobs where the firm calls a top lawyer at  am in the morning to solve an issue for a company that would otherwise cost them millions and the lawyer gets paid  dollars  hour for that and what happens only the men are crazy enough to keep doing that and the women resort to a less demanding lawyer job,3,NOT
ive always wondered how aggressively women peruse raises and promotions compared to men,1,NOT
oh my god feminists,2,NOT
cant stand vocal fry,3,NOT
boo hoo im only making  a year how utterly terrible for you it must be a real struggle to survive,2,NOT
you keep saying wages but you mean earnings equal opportunity is freedom equal outcome is repression stop promoting forced outcomes,3,NOT
their is no wage gap this doesnt account on job or hours done,2,NOT
 if claudia goldin is such a good researcher how come she thinks that the entirety of jobs performed in society can be reduced to three categories business tech and science seems like shes trying to cherry pick the date to fit her conclusion doesnt it,2,NOT
i cant believe this is a vox video,1,NOT
its almost like you cant have everything you want just because you want it and there are consequences for your life choices weird,2,NOT
she is miles better than liz plank,2,NOT
thank you vox your videos are and i mean it the best of youtube thank you so much for helping us to understand the world were currently living ,1,NOT
its the median not the mean not the mode the median wtf,2,NOT
feminist that dont actually want womens rights and only want to boost their ego make it look like that the gender wage gap is a huge thing which it is but they overexxagerate and oversimplify it which makes it harder to understand for people who dont know about it,3,NOT
damn a video that isnt completely biased good job,1,NOT
this just makes me want to attend business school,1,NOT
there are only two questions relevant here  do women get paid less for doing the same job title with the same job requirements as men no the dont because that is illegal  do women have the same opportunity to move into higher paying jobs and demand the same pay as men via negotiations yes they do once these are considered any difference is purely down to the choices made by men and women and if women want to have kids they must accept that they are going to suffer in terms of pay but if they want kids clearly kids are more important than a career so who are you to judge,3,NOT
this seems to only pay attention to white women white women get  cents for a mans dollar black women get  cents and latina women get  cents if your feminism isnt intersectional you aint doing it right,1,NOT
so what you mean is the gender pay gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
tldr  the wage gap is produced by womens choices not discrimination were it otherwise companies would only hire women to pay them less and save  on their labor costsduh,2,NOT
lol female economists doing their research on wage gap aka being useless and wasting time there isnt any respected economist that ever considered this wage gap thing of any significance the fact that its still talked about from mid th century till now is proof that no professional actually cares about it because it simply doesnt exist and if it does there doesnt appear to be any effects on the economy its merely something for media and women rights activists to play with,5,ABU
americans always wants to find a stupid reason without evidence and more stupid people will support this reason will make more problem that problem now will continued on by stupid people so over all stupid men and women are the problem,3,NOT
this video ignores how much worse the gender wage gap affects women of color  cents on the dollar for white women  cents on the dollar for black women and  cents on the dollar for hispanic women,1,NOT
its because of different passions more woman choose to go to lower playing jobs than men like teaching because of their personal preference and more men wok in construction and computer science which you are payed higher,3,NOT
well seeing as it was a women who did this video maybe feminists will finally see what people have been saying about the wage gap,2,NOT
women take lowerpaying jobs those jobs are lowerpaying because we dont value the work that women do,2,NOT
hey congratz vox you actually placed some honest info to the public even through you still cant figure earningwage but you at least realized that women become mothers the most important job in the world now you just need to realize that a mans entry level job earning is higher because men make over  of the worker base for the most dangerous and physically demanding jobs on the market oil rigs sanitationetc baby steps thats all i can say,5,ABU
women tend to take more time off work and take more breaks off work and ask for raises less and they tend to work in fields with less paying jobs,3,NOT
why do feminists think a career is more important than a happy family,3,NOT
who came here to see the comments,1,NOT
men work themselves until theyre mentally and physically sick men will work at the expense of their relationships and family and friends men will earn money by dishonest or immoral practices but if we change the culture women can do this to i bet you cant wait to teach your daughter these things yay for equality,3,NOT
waitbut if women are paid less wouldnt that mean that theyd be the majority cause theyre less money i may be wrong,2,NOT
as an antifeminist myself i think this is a great video,2,NOT
so essentially this video pushes the idea that women need to be given advantages over men in the workplace in order for them to earn the same amount of money to fix a nonissue how egalitarian,2,NOT
its a very poor goal to eliminate the wage gap its far more important for people to choose what they want to do rather than have collectivists decide for you what you should do so that on a graph it looks like things are equal things are never equal not between genders not between races heck i have poor eyesight and couldnt become a pilot if i wanted to the point is that people get somewhat equal opportunities and get to make the choices of what they want to do not have some regressive outlet prescribe that we need to businesses shaped in a specific way so that aggregate earnings of men and women are equal what a stupendously poor goal,3,NOT
very informative video thanks for that but please please stop this vocal fry madness its hard to concentrate on the content when your ears tell you to stop watching,3,NOT
 its factually incorrect,1,NOT
thats depend do they work the same hours and do the same kind of work,2,NOT
in the gap graph around  we see women born in  having a wage gap that decreases from the ages of  how is this happening why isnt the initial childbearing gap ages  persisting throughout their careers shouldnt that gap be very hard to close for example if i save less when im younger its hard to catch up  to close a savings gap  with someone who saves more when shes younger are older women getting better raises and wages relative to older men indeed much better raises and wages to close that early gap or is it simply that the initial gap in actual dollars matters less and less as a percentage as the numberssalaries get bigger,2,NOT
nice video dislikes were from batshit crazy feminists and people who didnt watch the video women make less than men because they do less work short and simple,5,ABU
vox is speaking the truth respect,1,NOT
what about the law that bans discrimination in any form in the workplace this also includes money earned why does no one bring this up you can literally search it on google,2,NOT
jesus christ these comments are a shitshow,3,NOT
finally a reasonable vox video,1,NOT
if there was a wage gap only women would be employed,3,NOT
wage gap doesnt exist but earning gap does,2,NOT
great video buut holy vocal fry i knowa bit of a nitpick but it was quite irritating,5,ABU
hold the phone imma blow your mind if there was no wage gap does this mean women are now being paid more than men,2,NOT
for the love of all that is good stop using that vocal fry could not watch more than  minutes because of that voice cracking,5,ABU
a lot of people seem to be complaining before watching the whole thing it doesnt say companies simply pay men more it takes into consideration occupations hours maternity etc im a conservative and find this video completely rational,2,NOT
wow i was really enjoying your channel too bad you ruined it bye,2,NOT
man works for big business woman works at a gas station man makes more wage gap wage gap,3,NOT
the united states department said the wage gap is between  the aauw or the american association university for woman a feminist organization even said the wage gap is  almost identical to the usdl the wage gap is a result of choices not sexism,2,NOT
men were earning an average salary of  while women were earning  less  on average hint  is not  less than  the phrase youre looking for is women were earning just  of that or women were earning  less if youre going to make a video on economics at least try to get basic math right,1,NOT
vox should break this down in how it improves the lives of insecure driftless and unambitious males especially whiney white guys that think that being on the starting lineup of their hs football team is enough to score a hot chick except that it doesnt it takes an age old power from domineering entitled men in that if he knocks a girl up shes his and she will have to depend on his income and he will have most of the power in the household with women and men making similar wages in jobs that dont require college these woman no longer need to marry or even stay with shiftless men unfortunately a lot will still sleep with them and with birth control access varying from state to state sometimes that still ends up in babies that can link you to a car wreck for forever ugh then these sons having bad or no example of a good male role model assume super macho attitudes and just keep on continuing the cycle sad and pathetic,3,NOT
this is such a good example of white feminism great job on not bringing up anything about race ,2,NOT
women can only make more money than men in one job stripping,3,NOT
heres a hint it does not exist,2,NOT
nobody ever talks about this problem honestly    not one publication has the balls to say what needs to be said the earning gap is womens fault,5,ABU
holy crap a decent vox video with reason and facts,1,NOT
or just get your baby daddy to actually do some parenting,1,NOT
if the wage gap is real why doesnt companies only hire women,3,NOT
the wage gap is not real so brute efforts to close the wage gap will probably only lead to more inequality,2,NOT
lol once i saw vox was the uploader i immediately think bias im out,2,NOT
whichever side youre on we might as well just pass a law so that everyone no matter what gender race sexuality they haveare working in the same field gets payed the same,2,NOT
lol youre showing these graphs of how much chores men and women do and how much time they spend with the kids that stuff is so biased those arent things you can measure those statistics were probably aquired by asking women their opinions on how much their husbands help around of course itd be low,3,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that it doesnt exist commies understand the economy about as well as a flatearther understands special relativity,3,NOT
what i like is that this video explains it by using facts and not by shouting buzz words like sexist patriarcy mansplainers etc,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist dumbass,3,NOT
men tend to choose more dangerous jobsand take more hours,3,NOT
women should get paid less there weaker can complain more if women keep complaing let them have all the jobs and just watch how messed up things get,5,ABU
im really glad vox gave an intelligent person the job rather than carlos maza,3,NOT
if you want higher pay get a degree that allows to get a high paying job and pursue that career youre gender studies degrees are useless because no employer cares that you spent four years learning the false teachings that are your gender studies teachers opinion,3,NOT
very balanced bravo finally,1,NOT
so the wage gap exists because of life choices makes sense if i work more on call more and am willing to relocate further,2,NOT
see this is buzzfeed but better because here theyre actually unbiased and dont have  channels to keep track of,1,NOT
to be honest there really isnt a wage gap and if there is its near nothing its an earnings gap,2,NOT
its not a fact you lying bimbo its illegal to pay a woman less  for the same job its a reflection of personal choice how many women want to go into engineering or masters of business management mba or computer programming its going to get worse the more chicks take gender or ethnic studies in college they have no economic worth so good luck ladiesand dont blame anyone but yourselves for your poor life choiceswere not in the mood go make me a sandwich kout,5,ABU
my genders doesnt define my gender,2,NOT
of k is k interesting maths,1,NOT
majority of male models dont get paid as much as female models,2,NOT
the wage gap exist because men work more work higher paying jobs why are we still talking about this,3,NOT
the only thing women are better at then men is giving birth changing nappies and ironing men are better at everything else thats why men are paid more,5,ABU
if i was an employer and i could get away paying women less why woudnt i just employ all women lol save me money logic,3,NOT
feminists are always whining about something they claim they are fighting for equalities when in fact theyre fighting for superiority over man how can the so called wage gap be zero  and  is so small its negligible considering men work as spies or other dangerous jobs,3,NOT
thank you vox for finally telling the truth that the wage gap  and in fact all wage gaps are due to individual choice any  wage gap  between men and women is no different then between a doctor and dog sitter all individuals choices,2,NOT
if there is a gender pay gap and people are just discriminating against women why do female fashion models make more than male models,3,NOT
im pleasantly surprised at this video from vox also the gender wage gap to the dollar is actually around  cents less than men this is as the video states partially due to child bearing and raising a family but there is more to this part of it can also be women being told youll only make this much compared to men because of the wage gap so they dont strive to succeed more or perhaps move into a lesser job or even worse go into gender studies and only spend their life cursing the frightening patriarchy men generally being more aggressive when it comes to jobs as in more actively asking for a raise or promotion,2,NOT
gender wage gap blah blah blah,3,NOT
a wage gap video that takes variables into account,1,NOT
wage gap aka  bullshit,3,NOT
hm  never thought of it this way thats interesting,1,NOT
women are smaller weaker and dumber and therefor should on average be paid less,6,ABU
so theres no wage gap just an earnings gap employers arent sexist maybe people will finally listen,2,NOT
harambe wage gap,2,NOT
and it also doesnt look at age demographics,2,NOT
men should of course also take a greater responsibility for families but maybe that is longer down the line ,2,NOT
the wage job does not exist,2,NOT
i must of missed that fact that it even existed maybe because it doesnt,2,NOT
same pay for same position promotions and raises based on merit its how it is and its how it should be,2,NOT
if women earned less than men in the same exact job why would anyone hire any men if women really earned  for every  a man earns that would mean companies would spend less on wages if there was an all woman workforce if that was true every job would be taken by women,3,NOT
wait are you really defending the existenceof a wage gap now that everybody sane is trying to debunk it i worried that soon well see a video of why women should receive a salary for having kids,3,NOT
finally a video on the age gap which understands some economics its pretty freaking refreshing,1,NOT
it doesnt exist thats what people are missing,2,NOT
earnings gap not a wage gap if you could pay a woman less to do the same job then every company would hire women,2,NOT
there is no wage gap just an earnings gap also pay discrimination is illegal,2,NOT
i like how this video makes out like women suddenly out of nowhere get this horrible burden that is a child and have no choice but to take on a lot of the responsibility thats just what mothers do mom takes care of the kids if theyre sick dad picks up an extra shift mom goes to the recital dad picks up an extra shift ez,3,NOT
why dont women just have less kids i dont think any would really mind if a family has one or two children instead of  or three children also women with a lot of kids almost never work if you have three kids then u really shouldnt expect to go back to work until right around when the gap shrinks again,3,NOT
it almost sounds like the wage gap is the product of men and women making their own decisions and there is a statistical difference in the decisions women make vs men i see nothing wrong with this,2,NOT
there are many wayst o solve this wage gap problem i personally dont see it as a problem so long as earnings per hour is the same these mannerisms are all purely social and it boils down to undemonizing men and fathers as incompitent holliwood loves to show the mother as the does everything and the men as unparenting and if they are a good parent they are a divorced b mother died or c learning the mother is always more compitent in shows and movies in parenting this provides a social stigma that if there is a child in the family the man isnt the main influence its the woman this makes bosses in the business district highly uneasy with giving women promotions to jobs that require heavier hours or more rigorous work when they are pregnant as they will also have the burden of their children now another example is that in a core family ideal it is the man who does the work and the woman who stays home now when this ideal shifts its interesting to see how people react if both parents are working theyre both valued and putting money on the table if the father is working and the mother is not its considered a normal basic family if the mother is working and the father is taking care of the house he is often considered a leech and a deadbeat thus the men in order to avoid social hatred from peers and so on always gets a job or at least most men will try to get a job a woman on the other hand doesnt always need a job to be considered acceptable or normal a very huge example of this is in the military there is a large amount of males in there in a stable secure and well paying job while a large amount of women associated with the army happen to just be house wives without much of a job stastically this forces the wage gap to be in mens favor since they are socially required to be employeed or theyre considered practically on the same boat as criminals and meth heads finally this wage gap will probably never be fixed because of that earlier detail i mentioned the military is a dangerous job as well as lots of other jobs its clear that men favor or do not mind dangerous jobs that could result in injury or death while women on the other hand do not favor those jobs dangerous jobs pay more,3,NOT
so allow woman to work whatever shifts they want ya that wont negatively effect the business landscape look the wage gap is a myth i wont beat a dead horse im just so sick of hearing about it,3,NOT
wait icecream testing is a job im in,1,NOT
omg if you believe that  youre dumb,3,NOT
how could you not believe in wage gaps especially when there is evidence,1,NOT
no that isnt factually correct in the same field with the same work experience the same number of hours worked etc etc a woman earns the same well within a certain margin that is explainable by negotiation for pay men prioritise earnings more than anything else so they are tougher negotiating partners in most cases feminists would still be crying if it was  cents to the dollar  ps the gap is just all everything all men earn added up and everything women earn added up and then comparing the two it doesnt take into account that women often dont want to be engineers or in stemfields in general then again woman are also underrepresented among the physical laborers like trashmen not trashworkers but trashmen coalminers workers on oilrigs etc etc,3,NOT
the wage gap is babies having babies causes the gap if you dont want a wage gap marry a man in a career who makes much less than you and will be willing to be a stay at home dad,3,NOT
no women make  of what men earn it must be patriarchy oppressing women there are no other reasons kappa,2,NOT
crazy how vox has ignored this video completely also there is no wage gap it is an earnings gap dont bring up the race gap it is illegal the equal pay act of  made that illegal,2,NOT
can we please start calling it the earnings gap instead of the wage gap wage gap implies that something unfair is going on and its extremely intellectually dishonest,2,NOT
wage gab does not exist,2,NOT
they left out the part about men being forced to do all the dirtydangerous jobs in society and how those jobs pay a premium for the danger that also plays a role in the wage gap when are we going to try to close the death on the job gap over  of the people who die on the job are men is that less important than women making less money than men even though in reality women control  of the total purchasing power in america,3,NOT
they make it seem like that is all there is to the wage gap though what they said s true some women do suffer from pure discrimination when it comes to how they are paid,2,NOT
money is worth nothing on its own its what you buy with it that has value right women control where  of all money is spent even if women as a whole made  of the money men make they would still have more effective spending power than men,3,NOT
you really think if these greedy corporations could get the same job done by paying less they wouldnt do it its like saying why sports person makes more money than a teacher simply because they bring in the revenue,2,NOT
finally someone says the right thing and this coming from vox of all people,1,NOT
if two people have the same demand from other workplaces same experience same education same grades same connections and in every single way are identical to the workplace then they should get the same salary per hour thats simple the wage gap in many cases if not most comes because women value family time and social time higher than men do they also on average have more sick days than men do then you have the whole baby making period in the  year period for women if a man and a woman started out fresh out of university at the same job and same salary the statistics tell us that a man will sacrifice family time and social life to work more all these extra hours give more experience more connections and youll be more in demand by workplaces because of that in return that gives you a higher salary likewise a career woman that did all the same sacrifices that the man did will be similarly payed for their experience however another difference in men and women also determines their salaries and thats how much they demand a man will typically not be afraid of conflicts or stress in salary negotiations where as a woman will typically fold earlier and get a lower salary why because men are psychologically plugged or trainedinfluenced while growing up that men dont quit and women you have to sit pretty is it right or wrong neither each and everyone has their life to control if you want a career and rise to the top you have to sacrifice something if you want a family and time for kids and a lot of friends then you have to sacrifice something else biologically and psychologically were predisposed to certain things as a man i would love to be a stay at home dad and take care of the kids house and things like that however i work in education which also satisfy my desire to be around kids and teach with that comes many different advantages and disadvantages just like other types of work or lifestyles do point is that everyone needs to stop looking to blame others for their own shortcomings or sacrifices money isnt the only thing wealth can be measured in some  year old man or woman that sacrificed family and friends in order to build their career might have money but they dont have the same social life or family bonds again you pick what you want dont blame anyone else for that,5,ABU
kinda sad she has to old pics since theres no wage gap in k,2,NOT
wage gap doesnt exist man work more hours just that i am tired of explaining this to women,2,NOT
if wome didnt work there asses its not mens fualt,5,ABU
the gender pay gap is a myth no women will get paid less than a man if she does the excat same work and hours,3,NOT
the woman can have my full wage gap any day,2,NOT
my sister was watching phineas and ferb so the opening was playing and you know the part discovering something that doesnt exist that played exactly the minute i saw this video,3,NOT
a lot of people compare earnings not wages so men tend to make more because statistically they work more hours then women,2,NOT
i cant be the only one who notices that the only people who say the wage gap doesnt exist is men,2,NOT
i have a crazy theory women dont ask for raises as often or as loudly as men my extremely competent wife earned less than some of the people she was managing she thought this was okay because theyd been at the bank longer than she had i was unconvinced by that argument and i suspect a higher proportion of men than women agree with me,2,NOT
vox smarter than buzzfeed,2,NOT
actually the  thing isnt real its been illegal to pay woman less science the s,2,NOT
gender wage gap is a myth,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap is that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
progressives purposely leave that information out to push their narrative of the war on women which there is no war on women,3,NOT
i disliked this video automatically thinking it supported the feminist point of view i was pleased to learn they are actually intelligent and i turned that thumbs down into a thumbs up,2,NOT
these videos are honestly like the best,1,NOT
please stick to scientific videos instead of trying to push this leftist lie on your viewers,2,NOT
the real question is why do you want to close the gender wage gap by closing that gap other gaps will exist like an age wage gap nationality wage gap political affiliation wage gap earring choice wage gap etc are you going to close all of them what for why so,3,NOT
this isnt an issue woman in general just make different career choices than men working less or not at all in order to stay at home and raise the kids isnt a bad thing,2,NOT
if a woman you know is earning less than a man for the exact same job you should call a lawyer women have equal opportunity in modernised countries which means that they are free to pursue the same careers that men do the fact that less women choose to do this is where the wage gap comes from its a result of a personal decision from a woman and if its problem then more women should be transferring to the higher risk jobs that men dominate through fair process not discrimination and closing that gap we dont need to look into the wage gap because there is no difference in womens earning for the same job there is no discrimination in this gap between incomes and therefore it isnt an issue this isnt a feminist argument this is a study of the choices women make and they make those choices not because of some form of oppression or patriarchy but because they have the freedom to choose their job and less women choose high risk high paying jobs it doesnt prove anything other than that im not saying people cant research it its quite interesting to observe human choices but im saying that this can never be used to advocate a feminist issue because the way it is misrepresented over and over again makes it sound like one and anyone who uses it as such is either intellectually dishonest or retarded,3,NOT
oh wow cant believe theres a video on the wage gap thats fact based kudos,1,NOT
 please give data from the last two decades and not half a century ago,2,NOT
props for making this video its informing and i like how you guys not going with the black and white approach,1,NOT
so basically the wage gap which is really an earnings gap exists because of the careers men and women pursue and the number of hours worked i dont see where this is a problem if women decide to work as many hours and pursue the exact same careers as men do theyd be earning the same if this was a true wage gap which insinuates that for equal work men and women get paid unequally all businesses would hire women over men cutting their employment costs,2,NOT
no one cares sorry,2,NOT
cough cough feminist,2,NOT
i almost congratulated vox for making a good video then they moved past why the pay differences in men and women is what it is such as seniority and hours worked,1,NOT
being a primary caregiver is not a disease nor is anyone forced into it ask any of them those choose to be the primary caregiver because thats what they want raising children is a team exercise and there is nothing wrong with divvying up the responsibilities nor is it atall honest to theyre both working full time so they should be the same because theyre not men on average work a hell of a lot more hours even among full time workers,2,NOT
sucessful worthwhile men want women who can take care of children women who dont want to take care of kids should not expect to get married by sucessful men,3,NOT
cry babies disliking the video aproaching,3,NOT
so essentially men get paid more because they are more able to compete successfully for the difficult requirements of labor in different fields if we are to look to basic economics as a guide it would be more economical for men to specialize in these areas where they possess an advantage and for women to specialize in the areas where they possess an advantage considering the fact that what determines the specialization of the sexes are biological realities it is fairly irrational and uneconomical for women to desire to enter into the workforce in any economy that values efficiency of production,5,ABU
in the us  there were  employed men for every  women employed,2,NOT
you legit debunked your own video woman pay more attention to kids and males are more likely to do overtime because they are seen as the provider,3,NOT
hmmmm thats odd i disliked the video automatically,2,NOT
if you cant work the extra hours of course you wont make as much im glad harvard is devoting researchers to something we already know,2,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earning of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,3,NOT
their isnt one,2,NOT
men should take care of the children no it has always been women even back to the stone age they are biologically fit for taking care of kids,5,ABU
princess treatment of girls is the curse that make them vulnerable on reality check lessons taught to boys must be taught to girls  learn skills to fix your  others problems as no god or man will come to fix those  generate resources  add value b being consumer  go to point    b before even thinking about babies i myself was a born artist i gave it up to become engineer as art only adds problems engineering provides solutions,3,NOT
so what should be done is try to shrink the gender gap here  the society expects for the mothers to do more and mothere actually do more,2,NOT
there is a theory that states that after accounting for variables even though women still earn less it is likely because they are far less agressive when negotiating wages and asking for raises whereas men tend to be more heavy handed in requesting raises,3,NOT
work more earn more,2,NOT
well the obvious solution is to have men get pregnant as well i mean we have to assume that more mothers are going to want to take time off to raise the child they made vs the fathers we have to make people women make people it takes a lot of dedicated time women are going to have less time to workexperience than men in the same age group the only way to make up for that disparity is to artificially inflate wages for women lets be honest thats what were talking about right,2,NOT
proofe that feminism is bullshit,3,NOT
i love how far they reach to hold onto their victim hood no really if you look at if from this angle its plan to see im a victim,3,NOT
there really isnt a wage gap the thing people call a wage gap is actually an earnings gap when you compare women and men who do the same job work the same hours make the same sacrifices to their social life and family the gap shrinks to so close to equal you could never tell the difference,2,NOT
i would have loved if the video also included some information about mitigating factors like the fact that women while earning less money on average are the majority money spenders and also gender pension gaps men paying more into it while women are the primary beneficiaries and other such mitigating factors which render the gender wage gap meaningless and might actually flip things considerably towards men being the disadvantaged ones in the whole picture society is much more complicated than single data points,5,ABU
 unless i need to retake basic mathematics i believe that  is not  less than  but okay,2,NOT
so its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,2,NOT
the gender wage gap can never be used as an point of argument anymore because it is just saying that there are only  genders malefemale when really that is just assuming everyones gender which really triggers me,3,NOT
has vox considered that perhaps women would prefer working longer hours at home and men would prefer working longer hours at work everyone makes tradeoffs and those tradeoffs often result in different wages there is nothing wrong with this and its a mistake to assume any difference between aggregate male wages and aggregate female wages is an injustice that must be remedied,3,NOT
how can u compare when people got different occupation and stuff,2,NOT
the fact that women are more carrying with children is obvious  women have to stay with kids home while the man goes to work since that happens men gain up to  more income bcs they can adapt to the working schedule  women  better parent  men  better worker a quick summary of the video,5,ABU
you need to invest in a sociology book or even dabble in a little bit of phycology vox invest in some real research woman dont tend to spend over  years in college but males do there is no wage gap just an intelligent gap by the way your wage gap on the business end is way off how many females own a business compared to malesblame it on having babies close your dam legs,5,ABU
doesnt exist vox,2,NOT
thank you liked,1,NOT
can some one tell me why the starting pay is different im interested to know why the starting salaries are not the same,1,NOT
nice propoganda here vox,3,NOT
earnings gap not wage gap big difference men are willing to work longer hours and are more flexible with working strict schedules is it any surprise they earn more on average but for each hour their wage is still the same as their female counterparts wagegapmyth,3,NOT
all of a sudden theres  genders when it comes to money please dont assume my gender btw i openly identify as a lawnmower not a male,3,NOT
when you do anything to get views,2,NOT
so basically wage gap is a myth created by incompetent researchers and propagated by feminazis ,3,NOT
can any wage gap believer please point to the job workplace or employer that pays women less per hour than men for the same job please ,2,NOT
i really enjoyed the video but it ended off by saying that we can fix the wage cap by changing hours thats good and all but we must not deter from the true goal of viewing each other as equals remember everyone respect women,1,NOT
they say a womans job is never done which is probably why they get paid less just kidding there is no wage gap,3,NOT
a logical and rational presentation that covers more comprehensive than the simple flawed  theory instant dislikes from feminists,3,NOT
yea the wage gap is a perfect example of statistics being interpreted to suit someones needs its this fallback point that everyone uses cause it seems so unfair and they always use stats from degree educated people that work in still sexist fields of work the vast majority of people work for minimum wage and you dont see mcdonalds paying a woman c on the dollar just because of her gender she makes the same crap wage as the men there also men have a way higher rate of depressioninjurysuicides at work cause they work themselves to death so their wife and kids wont leave them and shack up with a guy with a better paying job,3,NOT
i believe the saying  you get out what you put in if a girl works in a normal job and only meeting the standard she is only getting the basic paycheck but if a guy works in a great job and putting more effort with more efficiency he is going to get the better paycheck,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that its fake,3,NOT
so the key to closing the wage gap is to make more flexible hours that would be great for everyone so you can plan your own schedule to fit your specific needs gotta get to the root of the problem rather than just seeing the surface,2,NOT
a lot of people use this explanation as an opportunity to be complacent in preventing workplace inequality its fine that women are paid less because they take care of their kids sucks for them such is life in reality workplaces should be child friendly in that they offer support to working moms working moms are citizens too and should have equal opportunity in the workplace they shouldnt be punished for yielding a new generation,2,NOT
how dare you bring actual facts into this debate,1,NOT
well according to the bureau of labor women earn less than men in jobs female dominated male dominated and gender equal just saying,1,NOT
this is false the biggest thing that shows that is the fact that noone ever says the same numbers,3,NOT
people want women to not only work to earn money to support the family but also take over majority of the household work and childcarechild rearing in other words men wants women to be superwomen but dont want them to complain at all sure some men share the household work but according to the stats that is like only a low single digit percent its kinda sad,1,NOT
childrearing whod have thunk it seriously you need a study for this more seriously this seems to be just another instantiation of how men an women are and behave differently meaning if we collect all factors contributing to the so called wage gap we likely find out the playing field was level all along the players just moved differently on it,2,NOT
i think a big part of closing the wage gap is going to be empowering men to be the primary caregivers of children,1,NOT
its not like women were made to take care of children,5,ABU
the waaaaaaaaage gap isnt real,3,NOT
i thought that this would debunk the wage gap as what it really is being an earnings gap the earnings gap states that overall women make less than men with roughly  cents to a dollar being the figure that they come up with this is statistically true since on average most studies on the subject have shown that men more often ask for raises apply for the highest paying jobs ie stem tend to go into overtime more often and that men arent biologically capable of having children as such men tend to work longer hours and with the same pay earn more women on the other hand have all of these obstacles to overcome if they are to work for the same time and earn as much the icing on the cake is that the pay gap has been made illegal therefore all companies who do this are to go to federal prison as such there wouldnt be a pay gap anywhere in the united states might i suggest you research what you hear before making a video,3,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination name the youtuber,2,NOT
 notice how the gap increases steadily in prime pregnancy yearshmmmmmm i wonder if there could be a correlation,3,NOT
what people miss on the wage gap is that it dont really exist unless youre a feminist and just want to get paid more for doing less,3,NOT
her accent is so annoying,3,NOT
still being stupid by calling it a wage gap stay dumb and in denial vox,3,NOT
 feminists were triggered by this,3,NOT
most people miss the fact that it isnt real,2,NOT
yeah men make more but men work more stupid woman,5,ABU
i wonder where do the early dislikes come from i mean whenever i come to a video by a notification there is a likedislike ratio of sorry for bad english,2,NOT
crackle crackle crackle damn that voice,3,NOT
jordan b peterson,3,NOT
theres a wage gap and income gap,2,NOT
if employers could get away with paying women less for doing the exact same job no one would ever hire men people make exactly what they earn,3,NOT
plus it should not be called wage gap but earnings gap or something,2,NOT
uhits kinda against the law to pay someone less because of their gender what wage gap,2,NOT
wage gap is a lie,2,NOT
woah i was pleasantly surprised this wasnt a feminazi,3,NOT
it does not e x i s t period,2,NOT
there simply is no wage gap,2,NOT
its funny how vox admits that the argument is total bull at the very beginning of the video they admit that the wage gap is based on nothing but median wages of both men and women do you understand what that means that is the average of all female wages compare to all male wages it has nothing to do with females making less money for their time at the same job as a man it only means men spend more time working on average men tend to get pregnant at a far lower rate than women men tend to work more over time than women statistically men are more likely to do high risk jobs that have high pay men are less likely to work minimum wage low skill jobs than women men are more likely to work night shift jobs than women men are more likely to do physical jobs than women men are more likely to pursue lucrative college degrees than women men are more likely to own a business than women men are more likely to do dirty jobs than women men are more likely to stay with the same company for long periods of time than women not for doing the same jobs these are just a few of the examples of why if you compare the totals men make more than women after all if a company could get away with paying women  less than men they would only hire women,3,NOT
are we just going to say that women get paid less than men even though in  out of  of the wealthiest cities in america women make an average of  percent more than men this statistic kinda destroys the whole argument that there is sexism not to mention women on average work fewer hours additionally women are less frontal so in a job like a business they would probably not be very good at it for the reasons you said and others business would be a terrible job option for women and to say that is due to sexism is ridiculous because of a male babysitter makes horribly less money than a female one yet no one chalks that up to sexism men will do a worse job when it comes to caring for children just like how women will struggle in jobs that require force its all biological yes women can display force but biologically they arent forceful vox fortunatley took a factual approach to this and not just outright saying that sexism is the reason as i have seen people do in the past but saying that women jsut need to blanket get paid the same as men are stupid we need to look on a more individual level try to find a women who does the same exact hours as a man has the same experience has the same job and does literally everything the same as the man and she does the same level of quality as the man and i guantee you she will get paid the same amount unless you look at another statisctic which states that women are  less liekly to push for more money this is alos led to a gap not because of sexism but due to bioligical inscurities,5,ABU
if you are reading this you have come too far and shouldnt go any further,1,NOT
men are more likely to ask for raises,2,NOT
people also miss that the wage gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
never made mention that men typically work more and longer hours thus increasing pay also that men are more likely to go for higher pay in riskier jobs like mining and oil drilling,3,NOT
its pretty hard to believe in this wage gap when you arent affected by it i mean why would someone pay females less than males it makes no sense but my mother has experienced this wage gap and institutional sexism in the workplace when she found out by accident that her male counterparts who had been working the same job same hours same past experience were getting higher wages than her for no apperant reason call it a lone case or a sexist boss but this could be happening anywhere in front of your eyes oh and this happened in a country with probably the most gender equality in the world,1,NOT
i think instead of most woman arguing over the webs about it we allincluding myself a male need to do something about it,1,NOT
solution breed genderless people via cloning in the laboratory  an artificial womb all war between the sexes solved,3,NOT
why all the comments men who dont understand the privilege they have at all and probably didnt watch the video anyway the to is only truly equating white women vs white men its even worse for woc,2,NOT
 wtf theres still a gap though,2,NOT
well women are better at multitasking and taking care of children resulting in lower paying jobs like taking care of their own children or being a teacher or a waitress and men are generally stronger and can focus on one thing better resulting in better jobs like engineering these are just natural born instincts and so if a women has a job that men can kind of do better the quality of work might be less than a mans quality of work resulting in being paid less i dont know this for a fact but i think that is a possibility right,5,ABU
everybody who works good get paid good,2,NOT
oh those poor people with their six figure salaries,2,NOT
my last job i worked  years towards becoming supervisor only to have a horrible women who was bff with a head board member became my supervisor in  months so i am not buying into the wage gap it is fake,2,NOT
i was expecting a video blaming the patriarchy god i hate that word for oppressing women by decreasing their salaries but this video presented a really good very wellproven argument yet another great vox video but i have a question someone in the comments mentioned that in some countries like india schedule flexibility isnt the or the biggest cause of the gender gap  they didnt present any proof but i was hoping that someone who knows about the topic could clear it up,1,NOT
with the pharmacy example  theyre saying we shouldnt own our own business to reduce the wage gap better to work for a multi billion dollar company than be your own boss,2,NOT
wait wait wait at the end you were saying with jobs with more flexiable hours the pay gap is less but why,1,NOT
what they miss is something that ceases to exist,2,NOT
did the people in the comments not watch the video,1,NOT
isnt this the same channel that said the gender pay gap does exist,1,NOT
they forgot about taking into account different job positions as well as the fact that its illegal to pay a woman less,2,NOT
lowkey was about to unsubscribe until she started explaining it instead of playing the victim card,2,NOT
this has the least amount of bullshit in a vox video ever,2,NOT
this is just a feminist channel now un sub,2,NOT
i like how the wage gap doesnt actally exist lmao,2,NOT
there is no wage gap in western countries only an earnings gap,2,NOT
if i was a business manager andor owner i would set an hourly wage and pay everyone based on the hours they worked wait i think thats how it already works,2,NOT
please stop drawing out the last syllable of every word and you need that informationnnn if you want to start closingggg the wage gapppp,3,NOT
if i was running a business and could get away with paying women less why couldnt i just pay everyone lower more profit for me right,2,NOT
women work in different fields different fields pay different salary women have maternity leave so they take a cut on pay for it there is no wage gap if the gap existed every company would only hire women since it would be cheaper,2,NOT
feminists disliked it k times they cant stand reality,3,NOT
ok feminists want equality fine here previously it was females and kids to go off a sinking boat now its kids first and then men and women fight to the death to leave,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap is that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
how about we make it more culturally accepted even expected for men to do just as much in the home and when it comes to taken care of kids i dunno seems that would be most fair,1,NOT
or dont have kids problem solved,3,NOT
if youre going to include unpaid working hours then why not include as pay the cost of chocolate and flowers that woman get on valentines day and her birthday the cost of the vacation trips her man takes her on the cost of the movie tickets and popcorn her share of the restaurant bill and entertainment her share of rent or the mortgage utilities the engagement ring the wedding that some man paid for and her share of the income tax that he ends up paying and the child support that she uses to buy new dress and shoes the health and life insurance that he pays and how about the social security and life insurance payments she will receive and everything she will inherit just because she married a man now you know why men dont live as long as women,5,ABU
wage gap isnt real,2,NOT
you lefties live in lala land what business owner would pay more for the same work,3,NOT
vox always get it wrong,2,NOT
i love when femenist say that men steal their jobs then right after they bring out the wage gap if that were the case then why would business even hire men in the first place,3,NOT
none of this will matter when the robots take over,2,NOT
for the same job women and men will earn the same men are just more likely to work overtime or take on extra tasks than women who are generally more concerned with taking care of children if the gap was so real why dont companies just hire all women if it costs less for the same work,3,NOT
cant you just be thankful you make ,2,NOT
the wage gap is just the average earnings of men to women not even taking into account the jobeducation or hours worked,2,NOT
important to note that women make less in jobs with flexible hours because they work less hours statistically speaking not calling women lazy just statistically lazy ,2,NOT
this is bordering on real journalism,2,NOT
so essentially it once again boils down to personal choices,2,NOT
it called the motherhood penalty its bullshit,3,NOT
this channel should be put to death however everyone working at youtube believes that there is a wage cap with vox pushing on racial profiling such as their videowalking while black im surprised they havent been taken down already,3,NOT
this was done really well didnt blame it on gender but the fact that women generally take care of the kids at home really well done,1,NOT
wheel that c is because when the house is burning down and my wife gets out im the who goes back to safe the kid or when were on a ship and it starts to sink my wife and kids get on the life boats and i stay or when ww starts women done get draft i will so that my view,3,NOT
the wage gap is thrown off balance bc theres a minority of men who become ludicrously rich and a large chunk of men work extremely dangerous and thus well paying jobs,2,NOT
im fairly impressed most other liberal shows and news sources miss out on these points,1,NOT
it was a bit cherrypicking but in general a decent video on the gender wage gap,1,NOT
beeing a mother is the most important job of all,5,ABU
when a woman leaves the workforce to have children have you factored in that the male has to work extra during that period to try and cover some of the earnings loss,3,NOT
female models make more than male models female pornstars make more than male pornstars,3,NOT
even if this was true plenty of wives and girlfriends spend his monies,3,NOT
k woman disliked this video,2,NOT
k feminist disliked this video,2,NOT
what gender wage gap,2,NOT
vox you used to provide useful information go to a third world country if you want to learn about what rights are this is a vastly oversimplified biased video unsub,2,NOT
cool someone who supports the wage gap idea but actually gives reasoning for it aside from men are terrible and nasty im on your side vox,1,NOT
this is still false,2,NOT
i used to subscribe to this channel,2,NOT
what people always ignore about this same wage gap statistics is that it also shows asian americans make more that caucasians,1,NOT
their is no wage cap,2,NOT
how many wives complain the hubby spends too much time at work,2,NOT
if the wage gap comes down to women choices then why would we seek to change them if women choose to earn less and spend more time on family who are you to disagree they arent being hurt  this is not sexism its free people making free choices,3,NOT
the reason is because they dont work as much as men men normally take more over time and less vactions,3,NOT
we can talk about the wage gap when we talk about the death gap k k,3,NOT
there is no such thing as a gender wage gap there is a gender earnings gap big difference why is the onus always put on employers rather than the differing lifestyle and career choices women make to falsely portray women as victims to imply men get preferential treatment by employers come pay day thats all bullshit women can earn the same as men if they work as hard and as much simple really,3,NOT
the man tears in the comments are thick and heavy gain,3,NOT
i like how this video doesnt just blame sexist employers and looks at the actual causes of the wage gap,1,NOT
before you comment that the wage gap doesnt exist i strongly recommend sticking around with the video i think youll find that theres consolodation from both sides and gives note to an often untalked about fact that fathers are not encouraged to care for their children as much as mothers,1,NOT
im still waiting to get paid x what a woman gets paid to do my job waiting,2,NOT
im surprised by vox a liberalleaning website made a measured explanation of the wage gap and did not harp over the infamous  statistic that so many institutions continue trying to use to make their case the points in the video were valid and did not represent a misconstrued viewpoint overall very effective,1,NOT
wooooomen power i say men are lame because men are smelly and sexiest im raped everyday yesterday some man came up to me and said heyi like you and i was wondering if you wanted to go on a date ugggghh so disgustingg womenpower,5,ABU
because women are quieter and dont ask for promotions less abitious also guys can do well paying hard physically demanding jobs,5,ABU
so you want more pay for less work   you want equity not equality,3,NOT
at least they are being somewhat real about why the wage gap exists and it isnt just the typical liberal baiting and they arent just blaming it on sexism and discrimination,2,NOT
if the wage gap does exist why doesnt all people who own companys just fire all men to save money,3,NOT
everyone at my job including  men and  women make  an hour ive seen a female coworkers paycheck looks the same as mine,2,NOT
imagine vox thinking it has an opinion,2,NOT
lmao those dislikes feminists be like butmuh oppreshun,3,NOT
seems to be a lot of downvotes for a fairly neutral video on some of the different reasons why the wage gap exists,1,NOT
so in simple terms if you really want to get rid of the wage gap women need to stop having kids and work the same hours with the same level of flexibility as men do problem solved next problem please,3,NOT
i enjoyed this new perspective,1,NOT
there is no wage gap its normal for men having more salaries because more women tend to stay at home taking care of children while us men do for our familys need,5,ABU
wage gap is a fantasy,3,NOT
wow k downvotes amazing how incredibly indoctrinated some people are,2,NOT
well i cant speak for all women but for me  im a single mum and the only time ive been paid less is when i decided to be a stay at home mum other than that ive probably earned more than my male counterparts at times through out my career wage should reflect skills not gender and like most commentators have stated here its actually illegal well in western countries anyway,2,NOT
its not sexually bias its just who can work harder than the other it appears men work harder because we spend more time working than complaining,5,ABU
more of your vids should be like this,1,NOT
feminists keep it chill,2,NOT
wow its almost like women and men are equal but different like biologically women still bear children men still dont and also in their interests and talents crazy no but seriously great video gonna send this to all my feminist friends d,3,NOT
this video didnt address race at all white women make even more than women of color typically and i feel like you cant have a conversation about wage gap without addressing that did women of color also earn closer to what white women earned in jobs with more flexible hours,1,NOT
if there ever was a wag gap then only women would be hired because they cost less,3,NOT
wow an actual sensible video about the wage gap,1,NOT
my mother makes more than my father quite interesting that vox posted somethingsensible,1,NOT
she isnt considering all factors very unreliable source,3,NOT
female pornstars get paid way more than male ones this is a problem,3,NOT
 why is science so far into the left i thought science related jobs had good pay,2,NOT
another factually inaccurate video from vox no wayyyyyy,3,NOT
race plays a factor,1,NOT
asian men earn  to every one dollar a white man earns is the united states an asian supremacist nation or do they simply work harder,2,NOT
business school isnt looking too bad,1,NOT
bullshit you put in the time you make more money if you choose to have kid and put your priorities towards that instead of work you make less simple cant do both also men have occupied most of the dirty dangerous hard jobs not stuck in a safe air conditioned cubical  i cant stand feminists a byproduct of weakness,5,ABU
shrinking wage gap  but men always get paid more regardless of the profession ,2,NOT
these comments are exactly why the wage gap wont be going anywhere anytime soon we present you with a clear break down of facts and statistics and explain both the causes for these statistics and the implications and all we get in return is lying feminazis well you can lead an idiot to knowledge but you cant make them learn i guess,2,NOT
a propaganda video that intentionally ignores the most relevant facts,3,NOT
what people miss about the gender pay gap it doesnt exist,3,NOT
thank you for being awesome vox i try my best to avoid watching channels that seem too biased in either direction and so in the past have often avoided yalls videos but more and more i have found that whenever i do go and watch a video of yours i find it to show the full story pretty much everytime sorry i ever doubted ya,1,NOT
what people missed about the wage gap it doesnt bloody exist,3,NOT
vox is that you,1,NOT
oh that dislike bar,2,NOT
it is illegal to pay a man and women differently its not an argument about earning potential but rather earning outcomes there is no argument here,2,NOT

she is totally trolling it dont last for a day she was eating chicken on her snapchat,5,ABU
whats wrong with her insta,3,NOT
at first freelee i actually hated you i thought you were rude  i really thought that you should have minded your own buisness but still i kept being subscribed to you  still watched your videos day after day i saw videos of you telling celebs to carb the fuck up and telling them how fucking wrong it is to eat animal products today is my first day on a plantbased diet i couldnt thank you enough for spreading the messege and showing the brutal and honest truth without your honest words and the footage you show in your videos i wouldnt be on a vegandiet today and i love it i couldnt thank you enough,2,NOT

i dont believe her,3,NOT
i think its so awesome that trisha is going vegan and i really hope she sticks to this diet and enjoys it i understand its not for everything and i would never force anyone to join a diet that doesnt make them happy but i think everyone should at least give it a go there is no harm in a twoweek shift to a vegan diet and i think if everyone gave it a go we would have so many people convert,1,NOT
didnt freelee make a video just for shane dawson to try vegan foods did he just ignoring it ,2,NOT
checkout her latest video she is not vegan lol,3,NOT
what youtube download plug in she is using,1,NOT

there was a bacon add before this video xd,2,NOT

being a bully is not the way to successfully advocate veganism for all the people who think all vegans are delusional and judgmental assholes please visit unnaturalvegans channel very aggressive people like freelee are great at bringing attention to veganism but a lot of that attention is very negative while many people believe that any attention is good and is spreading the word i do disagree we need to be educational not hateful bullies ive mentioned that i was a vegan and have been told to kill myself when i wasnt being rude or telling anyone to change at all people hate me because of vegan extremists they think all vegans are extremists im aware that if i get any replies to this comment they will probably be incredibly negative from both vegans and omnivores im usually the unpopular opinion in both groups i get bullied by non vegans because im a crazy vegan and i get bullied by the vegans because i dont support the angry vegan movement too much hate,1,NOT

hi freelee ive been thinking on going vegan for such a long time now id say probably  months but ive never gotten around to this because my parents dont support this opinion and all they cook is animal based products im  so obviously i cant move out lol i was wondering if you had any tips for going vegan even when everyone around you eats meat i naturally have never been obsessed over meat tbh like i never found the tastiness about it so that is not really what my problem is my problem is that my parents will not buy the large amounts of fruit that i need for the raw till  diet that i really want to get to is there a better way to still be a high carb vegan without doing the raw till  diet thank you for influencing me and making me realize that animal based products are disgusting ,1,NOT

im considering going vegan but i need some advice there is something which has prevented me from becoming vegan ever since i was little ive been naturally skinny its very easy for me to lose weight so i have to be careful not to skip meals or else my bmi will drop down too low either i have a very high metabolism or maybe i have some sort of issue with absorbing fat i have unresolved digestive issues as well but anyway it makes me feel like i need that extra fat in my diet thats in meat and dairy as unhealthy as it is im worried that if i go on a plantbased diet ill lose weight like all of the vegans seem to i really cant afford to lose weight should i be worried about a vegan diet,1,NOT

yeah you did it,1,NOT
success this is wonderful,1,NOT
lets all stop bashing trisha for everything i understand that she needs to be held accountable for her actions but in saying that i think this is a huge step and we should all support her in this time of change as opposed to tearing her down,1,NOT
so she hates on trish until trish makes a video about what a god freelee is interesting,3,NOT
what happened to your instagram i cant find it,2,NOT
love you freelee,1,NOT
does freelee workout,1,NOT
freelala secret fetish is meat,3,NOT
your still irrelevant freelee now you found someone else to be equally irrelevant with,3,NOT
i want freelee to be my personal trainer  this shit is hard ,1,NOT
this video was shot a while ago the music video she was talking about was daddy issues which is already out and she was wearing this outfit like  weeks ago before she went out with shane im sorry guys but the two weeks she was referring to are already over and she didnt go vegan after all ,2,NOT

im crying this is great news ,1,NOT
yay a plane piss off plane freelee the banana girl  ,1,NOT
love this reaction this is why i love freelee she may come off strong at first but its due to passion and i love how supportive she is of everyone who is making the effort to go vegan so inspiring,1,NOT
this girl does have an amazing body that she works her ass off for much respect ,1,NOT
great job trish,1,NOT
are you nippling me fucking finally,3,NOT
is it for real now ,2,NOT
 apparently i have multiple personalities cos im genderfluid,3,NOT
love ya trish but im taking a break for a bit i pray you figure stuff out and god speed,1,NOT
all i hear is yes but actually no,2,NOT
this is pure waffle,2,NOT
how could you say that youre transgender just because youre attracted to gay men shame on you shameonyouuuuuuuu ,3,NOT
trish i love being a thicc boi also trish i wore sports bras because i was self conscious about my boobs,3,NOT
trish could have saved everyone this mess if she just understood what gender fluid is,3,NOT
gender fluid pansexual im l o s t,2,NOT
this bitch is still around must be losing views and subs,5,ABU
someone come get their friend ,3,NOT
i think shes just misunderstanding these terms therefore incorrectly explaining how she identifies as transgender male,2,NOT
so is she called tristan now,2,NOT
you faked being lgbt once why would you think we would believe you a second time,3,NOT
no disrespect but it sounds more like gender fluidity than transgender but you know you better than me just saying what i thought about how you described everything much love trish keep doing you boo ,1,NOT
its confusing but i get it in a way,2,NOT
way to stereotype gay males and everyone else,3,NOT
yall know trish is a troll right,3,NOT
do you know what gender dysphoria is,3,NOT
what did i just watch,3,NOT
as a transgender man i agree and experience some of the things trisha said but also greatly disagreed with other things im not going to say trisha is lying or trying to just get attention right now but im not fully convinced since trans people should transition to identity as their trans identity im on the fence and wether or not i take this seriously all relys on trishas actions from this moment on,2,NOT
trisha  having a zit doesnt all the sudden make you a guy lmao,3,NOT
trisha are you okay,3,NOT
i think shes simply mixing up her terms definitely seems genuine though,2,NOT
do i think im transgender yes a thousand percent do i identify with my birth gender yes it doesnt work that way,3,NOT
do i identify as trans  do i identify as my birth gender  bitch what that literally defeats the whole purpose like i appreciate her being openminded and accepting of the trans community but you really cant make a whole ass video coming out as trans when youre literally contradicting yourself the whole time and very clearly are not trans,3,NOT
trish i thought you knew better,2,NOT
annnnnnnd there goes my last braincell,3,NOT
im all about boobs that was hella uncomfortable for me to say btw hello im lyam im transgender ftm if you are able to say boobs and say youre girly or say that you were female at birth is absolute bullsht if you were able to say thoes words without feeling dysphoric hate to say it but youre not transgender youre just an sjw that is in it for the fame and money because you get paid to make these videos that means youre basically using the lgbtq trans community for money and your own comfort we fought long and hard for our spot today we get harassed and bullied for being who we are some of us even commit sucide because we dont feel comfortable in our body this is really fucked up of you if you were trans and had the freedom to transition you would have done it by now quit the bullshit and stop making the trans community look stupid,6,ABU
its really spooky season,3,NOT
trish i know this may sound crazy but when i was in middle school i would hate it when old men would creep on me so i guess im trans,3,NOT
baby i support your gender identity but this does not sound to me like being a trans man however this does very much sound like genderfluid identifying female sometimes male sometimes sometimes neither sometimes both,2,NOT
i dont think theres anything wrong with what she said,1,NOT
ive followed trish through everything her relationships her mental breakdowns her glow ups her going through her mental disorders all of it but this this is something else,3,NOT
coming from a trans man this isnt how it fucking works trish you need gender dysphoria to be trans gender dysphoria is feeling a disconnect and discomfort in your biological genders body and you clearly dont have that issue trans men can be gay yes trans men can like makeup and fashion yes but trans men absolutely do not want to be seen as a female thats against everything we stand for and have to go through this shit isnt a joke trish being trans isnt something you randomly use as an excuse for not liking straight men or for feeling insecure about being called a bitch because you are assertive you are one of the reasons people outside of the community see us as a joke i hope this is either a shitty joke that you somehow thought would be funny or that people realize this isnt how being ftm works,5,ABU
look what shes talking about is an actual feeling that some of us have due to trishas past i wouldnt validate that either but she said everything ive felt my whole life,3,NOT
i think you are just gender fluid,2,NOT
trish im attracted to gay guys also trish that must mean im a trans man,3,NOT
i have to laugh because otherwise im gonna lose it,3,NOT
oh god is she ok i feel a britney moment might be happening soon,3,NOT
trisha coming from someone who fully supported you for  years trolling or not girl stop,2,NOT
idk about this i think youre having an identity crisis,2,NOT
this is why we should go back to being the gender we are born with,3,NOT
is this because your ex disappeared on you and ended up gay,3,NOT
trisha  you are mentally ill this is nothing to be ashamed of rather the opposite often times but for your sake i think you should talk to someone,5,ABU
ok take testosterone and cut your tits off get dysphoria lmao fuck off,6,ABU
maybe youre biand gender fluid,2,NOT
trisha im sorry but u are not a gay man,2,NOT
lol so ur telling me jason nash fucked a dude,3,NOT
do i think im transgender yes a thousand percent do i identify with my natural born gender a thousand percent sis got the definition of being a transgender a bit wrong,3,NOT
she had a lot of valid points if she feels this way we cant really say she doesnt i stan,2,NOT
so because your lazy and thick you just want to become a boy ,3,NOT
i dont think i have ever ever been more confused by a video,2,NOT
this aint it trish stop i strongly recommend you stay in your own lane hunty,2,NOT
giiiiiiirrrrlll youve lost ittttttt ,3,NOT
this is the most shallow video of hers ive ever watched and i watched that do dogs have brains video,3,NOT
okay listen she or he its whatever the lgbtq is about love and loving all no matter how you feel just because she or he doesnt know the correct terms for what she or he is trying to say doesnt change the fact on how she or he feels this is how she or he feels and thats fine and we should all love that no matter what also with what she or he are saying about the difference between male and female is wrong just bc a guy wears makeup dont make him gay and viceversa so what shes saying is wrong but maybe she doesnt know how to put it yet and thats okay so stop saying all this shit when you have no clue how hard it is to do what she is doing i mean posting it and saying how she or he feels,1,NOT
basically what i got from this video is that trust wants to be a man and there is nothing wrong with that but she couldve just said i wanna be a man instead of this whole video lol,2,NOT
trisha doesnt like labels also trisha do i think im trans yes a thousand percent do i identify with my natural born gender yes a thousand percent says right after saying shes both,3,NOT
i wonder if she watches her videos before she posts them,2,NOT
i love her ,1,NOT
alphabet community are hilarious there are two genders scientifically cant argue with science people,3,NOT
wait i have acneam i trans,3,NOT
im confused i thought you were a chicken nugget,3,NOT
trisha no just nooo youre give the lgbt community a bad name,2,NOT
i dont think its all that nicedignified of you to in the same video even ask for acceptance and love and then put others in that same community down what with your whole not wanting to label yourself as theythem because people will think theyre right about you being schizophrenic not only is that incredibly discouraging and insulting to nonbinarygenderfluid trans people its a giant f u to people living with schizophrenia i can only imagine its hard enough coping with hearing and seeing things but imagine using a huge platform to validate unfair negativity toward them smh,3,NOT
i cant tell if shes lost weight or she has gotten botox,3,NOT
isnt this just a drag king no hate just wondering,2,NOT
you are fucking insane you are the reason that transgender people get a bad reputation because people like you convince everyone transphobe that we are all like you trans people are discriminated against every day particularly trans women of color and you are making this video with literally no evidence and no diagnosis of gender dysphoria that medical condition linked with being trans you are a fucking disgrace to the community you claim to be a part of also if you identify  with your assigned gender at birth that completely discredits you being trans,6,ABU
what drugs you doing,5,ABU
also trish i love you jessssssus,2,NOT
honestly i dont respect you or even support you anymore as a trans man you made me feel disgusted and violated so you can just fuck off,5,ABU
i dont think trisha is on drugs i do think she is having some mental health issues going on and possibly on the verge of a break down she seems very manicbipolar i hope she gets the mental help she needs,5,ABU
my reaction when i read the title  bahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahha breathes hahahahahahahahahahhahahahagahahahahhahahahahhahahahah,3,NOT
this video is just every confusing i think your just having alot of stuff going on and not trans not all girl like center of attention not all gay guys like glam and you saying you just relate to guys coz zits and you like gay guys some females are attracted to gay guys and girls obviously have zits to and saying you have penis envy i myself do some girls think its gonna be easier coz no piriods and more i mean you can do you but you make me and some others confused i identify as a theythem and you dont have to transition no defence in anyway but i find this video very un unbelievable ,3,NOT
trish if that makes sense    me no no it doesnt trisha ,3,NOT
is she transgender or,1,NOT
this is fucked lmao,3,NOT
really people  this is trish she trolls we all know shes straight shes just bull shitting,5,ABU
theres only two genders,2,NOT
that doesnt mean ur trans wtf,2,NOT
i think people are literally to blame for this like this crazy chick lives on the internet shouldve never even had the thought of being a male if it wasnt for people being so crazy about it and trying to question everything they do,5,ABU
sad to see so many people hating on someone that has such an incredibly hard time identifying with themselves their body and just who they even are wtf is wrong with yall get a life,1,NOT
i kinda get it wtf why is she kinda making some sense i dont have an issue with anything shes saying like go one girl live your best life whatever makes you happy fuck it be whoever do whatever as long as you know who you are no one elses opinions matter whatevs,1,NOT
i think shes trolling or shes on drugs,5,ABU
i think trisha embodies a s housewife unfortunately for her and thats the only problem i see here i believe shes confusing gender identity with normal things every person experiences because of this what she says doesnt show me gender confusion it shows me a woman who grew up insecure overcompensated and became overexposed and never learned the concept of acceptance i have pity for her and i think a lot of other people should too,2,NOT
does me finding this hilarious make me a sociopath cause i do,2,NOT
i dont even see whats wrong yes maybe trisha worded some things wrong but at the end of the day shes questioning let her,1,NOT
trisha do a bit more research before making a video like this just so you dont get as much hate maybe even like a small script just to outline what to say idk,1,NOT
im gay but this is so fucking funnyhdjzyxnsudb,2,NOT
trisha being a troll never heard of that,3,NOT
she will get so much shit now d ,3,NOT
its so obvious shes doing this for controversy and popularity shes done this time and time again on her channel voted for trump came out as lesbian became emo yall really dont need to spend the energy to get triggered by such obvious trolling,3,NOT
oh no trish,2,NOT
sis no please stop as a trans ftm guy this is not signs of you being transgender being trans isnt a joke the hormones we take literally will change you please seek a therapist and talk about this with them before posting a video and saying youre trans,2,NOT
so sis just admitted to being a pansexual genderfluid person but is trying to claim ftm homosexual,2,NOT
your gender is t just own it and be how you wanna be lol,2,NOT
honestly were all hating but like honestly i just dont understand let trish be trish ya know ,1,NOT
liking boy stuff does not make you trans bruh ,2,NOT
trisha having toxic femininity for  minutes straight,3,NOT
i mean you could be gender fluid maybe idek with you anymore look into it,2,NOT
im attracted to gay men sis so is gaga and she aint trans,2,NOT
she made k on this video,2,NOT
trish youve completely lost it,3,NOT
this is so problematic,2,NOT
the introduction to this video alone hit me really really fucking hard i was a tomboy as a kid got teased for it and felt a lot of pressure to be hyperfeminine as i got older it took me years to realize that as much as i loved being good at being feminine i didnt like how i looked literally everything youre saying about penis envy about how i felt a struggle between wanting to be a good feminist or a better stronger woman and this nagging idea that i was actually a guy it felt like a betrayal for me to give up my identity as a woman but now that im three and a half years on testosterone i know that my body is meant to have t in it kicking gender norms to the curb and escaping the conforms of what society tells you that you have to be being a gender nonconforming man choosing to forgo hormones or getting hormones and surgery all of those are perfectly reasonable you dont have to go hypermasculine to be a gay trans man hell you could date other gay trans men but at any rate youre absolutely welcome here youre not faking being trans theres no correct way to be trans,1,NOT
so are you a boy or a girl,2,NOT
do your research on what these words mean please i know you didnt mean to be offensive but i feel very attacked and that shit hurt im glad youre happy though,2,NOT
can we stop telling them what they are they chose to identify as this they should be accepted we should respect them as what they want to be if a friend was this video and said these would you act this way just respect them this can hurt people think with what little wits you have before you post something for i use theythem pronouns because i dont know what gender they are,1,NOT
i like gay guys so therefore im a gay man t,3,NOT
the nerve in monetizing this mess i cant,3,NOT
i know trish often does any and everything for clickbaitbutwhat if she reeeeaaaallly feels this way why does she get shot down when ive seen trans people who have more of the right look or woke rhetoric to go with their commentary pretty much say the same thingsshe feels like both why is this causing issues if she were skinny and androgynous looking people would totally call her brave for this,1,NOT
shes just not wellversed about the queer community and a lot of people arent i think maybe trisha could be nonbinarygender queer but its a big step to say one is trans i mean everyone has different journeys but being trans or any sexuality or gender shouldnt be announced on a whim or for clout,2,NOT
how much surgery have u had,3,NOT
i think i understood geometry more than this ,2,NOT
so shes basically saying shes gender fluid but the truth is she just wants everyone to be sexually attracted to her ,3,NOT
liking gay men doesnt mean youre a gay man it just means your trisha,2,NOT
the best thing about this video are the comments,2,NOT
gay men can be masculine u dont need to fit a stereotype to be gay this video makes no sense,2,NOT
i choose not to identify as multiple personalities i just finished watching her didpersonality disorderalters video ,3,NOT
does she realize how offensive this is to gigi one of her best friends on the platform who is actually transgender like please sit down and do your research before blabbing on the internet for attention thats all this is its just for attention so just report the video and move on,3,NOT
maybe look into gender fluid,2,NOT
if you dont want to watch the whole thing its just her confusing gender identity and sexual orientation she is a gay man physicallymentally now because she likes men who are also gay and that leads her to believe that she must be a man on the inside if i may add  as a cisfemale i also find the gay men she features on her channel to be extremely attractive but i know that is one sided on my behalf as their sexual orientation doesnt match mine but trisha seems to believe becoming a gay man will solve this dilemma of one sided attractions ,2,NOT
fam you sound gender fluid,2,NOT
wait no ones asking the important question here though will you be participating in no nut november now,2,NOT
i support everything and everyone dont come at me for supporting this,1,NOT
yall dont be such a dick to t the shit shes saying makes sense if you would bother to listen past the terminology that gets mixed up in here whats being said here is that t from the get go has not really felt like a girl but the reason she was so girly so feminine was to compensate for everyone calling her a boy when she was young when she puts on makeup nails clothes etc etc shes in drag its a costume its an outfit the way she describes women makes it clear that she doesnt feel like shes one of them i do agree w some people here that what shes describing here sounds more like being genderfluid than binary trans and i do agree that shes mixing up a lot of words but you cannot blame her for ignorance you cannot thrust someone out from the community for not getting everything  right we are not born knowing everything that needs to be and should be said or how to say it you need to learn these things at some point and some people do them later than others i for one completely support t and agree with what shes saying even if shes not doing it perfectly you fucking go its hard to do shit like this,1,NOT
how can this offensive bs still be online you tube should strike her whole channel please click the three little dots on in the top right and report report this under the violent or repulsive tab,5,ABU
omg is she serious now she is a gay guy or trans im so confused she had a boy haircut and now she thinks she is a guy,3,NOT
i bet shane is regretting having your name in his palette,2,NOT
everyone has a different way of identifying bcos trish doesnt identify how you do doesnt mean its wrong its trishs view point,1,NOT
not wanting ur period not liking the societal pressures sexualization  abuse u get from being female and wanting to fuck people does not mean ur trans  a trans male,2,NOT
drops views and subscribers i feel like a man,3,NOT
i was watching this and got sooooooo confused,3,NOT
so once in awhile you like to dress up youre attracted to men you cant have and like sensitive men and you wish u had a dick  because you associate power with having a penis your thinking isnt that complicated youre not transgender you just havent had a nice conversation with yourself to think threw your thoughts and feelings talk with your therapist about what you just talked about i have a feeling he might be able to help u out now if he doesnt then u might need a new one,2,NOT
did you peg jason,3,NOT
this video is most likely a joke,3,NOT
more like transspecies human to land whale,5,ABU
do i identify as a male yes  do i identify with my born gender yes umno thatsthats not transit could be gender fluid but no just no,2,NOT
i say this as a trans male my self trisha go fuck your self,5,ABU
someone teach her about gender fluidity this video is exhausting,2,NOT
so now that shes not in the news for exposing the vlog squad now shes moving on to offending the whole lgbtq community she really wants her name in the news doesnt she she really trying the most ,3,NOT
scrolling through the comments to find the one positive comment that somehow excuses the k likes,2,NOT
my head hurtsouch,2,NOT
okay i was gonna come here and roast the shit out of her but as i watched and listened she actually makes sense,1,NOT
you like gay guys you fantasize about girls im confused,2,NOT
im sorry but no,2,NOT
you look like you lost a lot of weight youve slimed down,1,NOT
being mean to t is not going to make you feel better ya losers ,2,NOT
whats wrong with her,3,NOT
ive never been so confused in my entire life,2,NOT
somebodys rent is due,3,NOT
how are yall getting mad about this this makes perfect sense how can anyone possibly say otherwise he is just a gay man who is also drag queen someone please explain to me why they think he is a woman and how they can go to sleep at night for misgendering him on a massive scale,1,NOT
holy crap she looks sooooo skinny her face is different,2,NOT
trisha just shut the fuck up,5,ABU
female to male is trans identifying as a male one day a female another day both genders one day or no gender another day is genderfluid not all girls are into doing their hair and make up and stuff i think she is just confused tbh ,2,NOT
shut up please,3,NOT
she is literally insane i dont even think she is educated does she know what dysphoria is,5,ABU
shes confused why bring her down and bully her just because your story isnt similar to hers yall attack her oh shes looking for attention oh shes being so rude oh so disrespectful get the fuck out of here trish can call herself whatever she wants get the fuck over it i just want to know why everyone is so fucking sensitive its insane to me,1,NOT
penis envy stop ,2,NOT
wtf am i watching,3,NOT
as someone with actual gender dysphoria and who identifies as trans this really pisses me off its people like trisha who have a large platform and spread wrong information about the transgender community everything she said in this video is wrong im not saying that shes wrong or anything but i think shes confused and she doesnt actually know what shes saying she needs to go see a therapist or something and get this figured out before spreading it on social media she needs someone to tell her the difference between feeling more masculine  tomboy versus being transgender and having actual gender dysphoria after all she did say that she identified with her sex  which you dont find in non binary people trans people or whatever,2,NOT
who else only came for the comments,2,NOT
what am i getting myself into now,2,NOT
trisha just be who u want to be dont listen to what anyone says their opinion doesnt matter just love yourself and be happy being who u r u can be whatever u want as long as it makes u happy people are gonna hate but thats life and if they cant accept that than the hell with them just make urself happy being u i wish u all the best in ur journey and life,1,NOT
youre not trans you dont have gender dysphoria stop appropriating being transgender its not fun,3,NOT
so every straight men is trying to be as straight as possible uhm how about non gay males not acting so straight,2,NOT
k dislikes jeez,2,NOT
i encourage you to visit or speak with someone who can educate you on this,1,NOT
i think trisha has a personality disorder she doesnt know who she is,5,ABU
oh god it hurts my brain i cant watch this shit anymore,3,NOT
oh shes lost it completely lost it,3,NOT
god whatever happened to just being a tomboy you relate to boys dont wear makeup etc you have penis envy great so does every girl ever because having a penis and being a man is just so much easier biologically and in the society that we live in its unfortunate but that doesnt mean that you are trans this is just frustrating to watch because so many of the things she is saying are things that everyone experiences and its really disrespectful and discrediting to actual transgender people,3,NOT
her hair looks so good,1,NOT
i identify as offended who else,3,NOT
lets be real here everyone who just drags her in the comments is the reason she keeps crying on her kitchen floor her mental health state is going down the goddamn stairs give her a break,1,NOT
love u but this aint it,2,NOT
this bitch got me fucked up,5,ABU
i know the vlog squad is having a fucking field day with this video i cant wait for jeff to bring it up in a podcast,3,NOT
trisha or t or any name you decide to use i dont know where to start with this video i myself am a gay transgender male the huge thing with being transgender is the want for more masculinity than feminism i like to present myself as a male dress as a male be called a male seen as a male nothing else not my birth gender i have dysphoria causing me to dislike my chest my genital and anything that makes me look or seem more like a female all true transgender males have dysphoria and discomfort with being a transgender male you do not identify with being a girl the birth gender you want masculinity you want to be seen as a girl i honestly believe you are a little confused and questioning look into being gender fluid gender fluid is when some days you love to present yourself as a male then some as a female people who are gender fluid us hehim and sheher pronouns most often meaning you dont have to use theythem pronouns please just look into it  also a lot of the stuff in your video is very offensive you say you dont like labels yet youre using them gay males are perceived as galled up and feminine in a way but most arent that way also saying you believe youre transgender due to loving short hair not having to tend to it girls and others can feel the same also when you say straight men turn you off that is so darn weird you automatically arent attracted to a male because theyre not gay thats almost like being transexual only liking and wanting to date trans men and women its just really strange and i dont agree with judging someone on their sexuality its almost heterophobia ,3,NOT
this probably wont get seen but trisha i can relate ive always felt more comfortable around men have always had more male friends than female have always been told i have a strong masculine energy and ive always thought my personality wouldve been better in a mans body i dont believe these factors make someone transgender they are absolutely real and valid feelings but i think you are still trisha youre just moulding that person into who you think others want her to be you need to be you regardless of what is between your legs,2,NOT
so basically tomboy and girly ,2,NOT
i think you meant to say youre gender fluid cuz ur not trans ,2,NOT
oh here we fucking go,3,NOT
ive always been attracted to guys but gay guys dated jason for months,3,NOT
if you just identify as a male u arent trans bcs trans means that ur transitioning from like female to male or male to female so like in my opinion u just as u said u just identify as a male and arent trans so like why do u say i am transgender please tell me if i said something wrong cuz english aint my first language lol,2,NOT
okay bitch stop how can you be trans if you identify as the gender u were bron with,5,ABU
she said  hair lip ,2,NOT
she either is  just doing it for attention  literally delusion as hell and needs help i think she has sexuality and gender mixed up she has shown zero signs of being trans her reasonings to being trans are a joke i am not one to say who u can and cannot be but come on shes making trans people look like a joke trisha has been needing serious psychological help  the back lash she willhas received from that video is going to change her life forever personally i think she is ignorant on the subject and has sexuality mixed up with gender adding on she has a lot of mental issues that she doesnt know how to control so pushing it on the im transgender is the easiest way for her adding on the whole attracted to gay men they are still men shit i like girls and i can see a girl who is lesbian and think shes attractive but that doesnt mean im lesbian it still would be heterosexual of me she needs help lastly masculinity doesnt make you male it is a spectrum,5,ABU
everytime she makes a video jason comes out of her mouth,2,NOT
literally you make no sense,3,NOT
i feel so fcking offended,3,NOT
lets pimples grow bc thats what men do and they dont care said trish ik so many males who are so insecure about their acne they just dont think to go and find the right products ,2,NOT

i thought this was a fever dream but here we still are,3,NOT
oof sorry bitch we gon cancel u now yikes,5,ABU

your your non binary not trying to offer you there is a difference this pisses me off even though you try not to offend people like your not transgenders your fucking non binary get your facts straight before you even try to post something like this,5,ABU
if she feels the way she does she has a right too how is it okay for a man to want to be a women and not get judged but if a women wants to explain the reasoning for her sexuality shes dragged if to ppl she doesnt sound educated thats fine but shell learn its  and ppl need to let her express her self because she didnt have to make this video but she did it to set her self free and to let her supporters know,1,NOT
im mad watching this im a trans guy,3,NOT
gender fluidity exists nonbinary exists tacking yourself to a constructed stereotype of a gay man just because you want to avert the male gaze is not being transgender i support someone feeling less than cis but this is a fucking train wreck that the trans community now has to field trans people have to fight tooth and nail to be taken seriously and now theyre stuck dealing with this,3,NOT
ur gender fluid u need someone in the community to guide u with the right terminology because all the stuff ur saying is wrong and im not reading u im just saying even tho as a transgender woman myself u need to find u and not be confused with what ur doing,2,NOT
transgender people have dysphoria if you do not have disphoria then you are not trans and dismorphia and dysphoria are two very different things you can be a masculine female without being trans you can be a feminine man without being trans trish please talk to people who are trans legit people who are trans because i know you are hurting so many people because you are calling yourself trans when you arent,3,NOT
im not even in the trans community and i am straight as a board and this is fucking triggering,3,NOT
i wish i hadnt watched this video i,2,NOT
why is there like k people hating on her in the comments,1,NOT
ik she is in the wrong but there is some part of her that is dealing with coming out in a way so we shouldnt come for her,2,NOT
soooooo youre queer not trans,2,NOT
does does she know that its not a thing to not identify as someone with did also hella worried about this woman in general,3,NOT
jason dated a boy,3,NOT
honey honey just say youre nonbinary and dont use they them pronouns just say your masc nonbinary please,2,NOT
im attracted to gay guys so i must be a gay guy it doesnt quite work like that sweetie,2,NOT
i understand why people are mad but i honestly just think trish needs a bit of education yeah trish doesnt like labels but i think if somebody were to just sit down and educate trish on the subject a bit more i feel like trish would feel better herself and would be able to word it in a less offensive way,1,NOT
you stupid bitch,5,ABU
ever heard of non binary i feel like thats what youre describing yourself to be,2,NOT
ur a tom boy ,2,NOT
i identify as a gay man and a dragqueen  your sexual attraction has nothing to do with your gender  you can not identify as a dragqueen being a dragqueen is a hobbyprofession and a great one i dont mean anything negative by that  being less typically feminine does not make you male being masculine and being male are two different things also being assertive is not being a man thats literally just being assertive,3,NOT
is this dumb bitch aware that masculine gay men exist too we arent just all feminine extra flamboyant drag queens not only this is highly transphobic but its homophobic as shit too why arent you cancelled yet,5,ABU
maybe youre like gender fluid or something else but i kinda think that you just dont wanna be objectified as yourself,2,NOT
soooo since i dontt wear makeup i might be transgender too,3,NOT
this is killing me girl first of all i choose not to identify as multiple personality are you kidding second what the fuck littrally no,3,NOT

ignore the haters this is your journey it is your story and you get to figure it out in your own way when youre figuring out who you are lables are going to change a lot im not sure if you know about or have heard of gender fluid or agender but seriously this is your journey and dont let people bring you down for sharing how you feel about yourself and being open,1,NOT

what the actual hell are you talking about,3,NOT
nobody trisha ive always liked gay men so im a gay man bruh,3,NOT

listen i get it yall r offended but we r telling her the exact same shit a lot of us where told when we tried to come out yall dont know whats goin through her head so please stop pretending you do ,1,NOT
soo trans people may not be confused as you said but you certainly are just read something anything about gender identification and dysphoria before you make videos like these hating makeup or attention or labeling people or having lots of gay friends doesnt make you a transgender honey,3,NOT
trisha what the hell are you talking about,3,NOT
identifying as both male and female is called being genderqueer or genderfluid hun youre confused please learn your terminology before posting a  minute video on something you clearly dont have a vast understanding of,2,NOT
i understand youre an edgy troll but this video is really hurtful ive been subscribed for years but after this i cant continue to support you youre misinterpreting what it means to be transgender and using it as a way to get attention,3,NOT

a few years from now a word for the thing that she is describing us will come out,3,NOT
the thumbnail of the vid looks like a joke for clickbait,3,NOT
not to be like the one to say no trisha youre wrong but for people that identify with being transgender identifying with the sex you was born as isnt a thing that happens like you kinda need to feel dysphoria and feeling like both isnt really what trans people typically say maybe youre describing a different feeling i would look into other queer gender identities,2,NOT
trish im not confused youtube watch next im questioningtrish me wtf,2,NOT
sis you do not know the feeling of dysphoria  if you did you would not be saying this shit,3,NOT
i might be crazy but anyone else understand trish here and doesnt think she is trolling everything she said can be proved she has always been attached to gay guys she always had lgbtq friends she does either dress up like a drag queen or just roll out of bed i think she just shouldnt label what she is and just go for what she likes,1,NOT
lol trisha has been doing trolling videos for years i dont know why you guys think shell be canceled,3,NOT

i think shes united both sides of the political isle in the name of what the fuck,3,NOT
no youre not trans you do not have dysphoria you may seem more masculine to yourself personality wise and you may find gay men attractive but that doesnt give you a male brain this is so unbelievably ignorant and disrespectful,5,ABU
omg what a troll hahaha ok trish and i identity as a cardigan sweater ,3,NOT
trisha stop hunny you arent trans youre just confused you need to get more educated on this topic,5,ABU
this is so hurtful you dont get to choose i am trans and its so invalidating to hear an influencer thats confused and who doesnt know who they are yet causing damage to the community people like you make the community look like joke im not saying you arent trans but you are confused and you need to do your full research people look up to you and its so rude for you to go on the internet and spread the wrong messages because youre not educated yourself,3,NOT
as a real transgender man this is ridiculous,3,NOT
do you use a strapon with your boyfriend then,3,NOT

this identity crap by these young american teens is hilarious child i dont care even if you identify yourself as a flower pot youre either a boy or a girl period,3,NOT
i think she just means she feels nonbinary and felt liberated from social expectations of a woman when she dressed like a man i dont think that necessarily constitutes trans man though,2,NOT
okay im fucking done,3,NOT
so what im hearing is because you have more guy friends then girl friends because you think gay guys are attractive because you didnt like the attention from grown ass men when you were in middle school youre trans gender nice,2,NOT

also anyone remember when jason  david would make gay jokesskits  trisha would talk soooo much shit about it  say how unattractive it was when he would act gay im finding this hilarious because she contradicts herself so hard like literally always,3,NOT
bruh literally everything you said as to why you identify as a man i can relate with but youre just being sexist like i dont identify as a man just because i dont like attention and dont wear make up every day its just who i am but im still a female like im not against transgender but like you really dont have any plausible explanation to be and its disrespectful toward people who actually have gender dysphoria and are trans,5,ABU
nobody me on my period,2,NOT
please be a joke please be a joke please be a joke,2,NOT
i love how she specified that she was trans female to male in case anyone tought she was mtf,3,NOT
trish wears short hair trish im transgender now,3,NOT
okay i sort of understand what shes trying to say but honey if you had genuine gender dysphoria you would have been out a long time ago thats all there is to it maybe you are gender queer or non binary if anything but youre def not a ftm who adheres to the binary because transsexual trans people whether mtf or ftm all have gender dysphoria,3,NOT

memeber yall this is the same person who asked if dogs have brains,3,NOT
shes describing more of a gender fluid or a non binary person i dont know if what she was saying in her video describes a transgender male or female i think she has her identitys mixed up she shouldve done more research before she posted a video trying to express and describe what label she thinks she falls under she still has learning and figuring out to do she needs to take time away from youtube to find herself,1,NOT
trisha im attractive to gay men me jason isnttrisha stfu,5,ABU
ok i know trisha is getting a lot of backlash about this and some of her reasoning might not make a lot of sense but honestly if this how she feels then we should support her,1,NOT
i liked girltrish better somehow she was less naive,2,NOT
wow she really filmed and edited,2,NOT
this video is a big ol oof,2,NOT
so non binary,2,NOT
sounds like shes pansexual and gender fluid,2,NOT
i think shes just genderfluid is what shes trying to say shes obviously confused so instead of hating on her maybe comment tips for her  she needs it lol,1,NOT
transitioning to avoid brushing your hair holy shit,3,NOT
i think you can be a guy some days and then i think you can be a girl whatever she said boi aint that gender fliud,2,NOT
wow i officially hate you lol,3,NOT
just because you dress up as a male from a musical does not make you transgender also i wouldnt refer to anything or anyone as girly because thats not really the correct term id say feminine and yes trisha is very feminine and presents feminine identifying with males is a totally different thing identifying as a male is a whole nother thing my question is if you are an adult now and can do what you want then why are you not attempting to somewhat pass another thing is because you are a straight female you are going to be attracted to gay dudes because you are straight that does not make you trans because theyre gay you have to have this thing called gender dysphoria something that all trans people have and you wouldnt definitely not even want to mention your chest if you actually had it because its a very overwhelming topic for transgender people i should now because i am trans and also your gender identity and sexuality is not a choice just like the natural color of your eyes and skin you didnt choose that,3,NOT
please say im not the only one that is confused af,2,NOT
i legit lost all my braincells,3,NOT
you are a trans icon,1,NOT
you just need to find a man who has a personality that fits you youre choosing the wrong type of men,2,NOT

i love you trisha but wtf you sound crazy af jason dodged a bullet with this one,5,ABU
what is this,2,NOT
i predict this video to go viral offend everyone because its  every views seeking commentator will make a video on it then shell delete it i know internet too damn well,3,NOT
this video just exposes how dumb trisha is like emotionally and intellectually oh my god,5,ABU
hey trisha i support you and will be by your side people shouldnt get mad at you just because your confused i understand how it feels to be lost look i honestly feel like the only gay guy whos on your side what i realized about these gays that get offended they act like theyre going through way more just because they get offended easily well im sorry they cant understand you for you im sorry they make thousands of sexualitys just to make gay go viral sorry our world fucked you up in so many ways you cant even find yourself i know how that feels trisha im on your side and im gay so what are they gonna do about it ,1,NOT
shes trying to be deep but shes as deep as a puddle,3,NOT
ummmm no youre basically saying that not wanting to put on makeup and not wanting to do your hair in the morning means youre a boy and youre transgender you dont like the association with being a female because with being a female comes with all the standards and expectations that media has put upon us you dont like how you feel when you dont meet those hypothetical standards and people make comments and because men dont have that same problem as women youre trying to say youre a man im so sorry but thats not how it works at all,3,NOT
girl what the fuck,3,NOT
maybe try a pixie cut with your real hair if you felt confident with that short wig,1,NOT
you are very brave for sharing this it may not make sense to a lot but you make tons of sense girl you are very aware of the fine details in your emotions love you so much girl,1,NOT
so nonbianry or gender fluid,2,NOT
from what trisha is describing i would say that she is actually gender fluid,2,NOT
to be honest videos like this is are why no one takes the lgbtq community seriously how can we expect people to not make fun of us when theirs people like trisha who use serious topics such as being transgender as a way to get more views and publicity this honestly disgusts me im sorry,3,NOT
i hate you there is no fucking way you can think this is okay,3,NOT
shes asking to kill her career,3,NOT
someone doesnt have to identify as one or the other sexuality and gender is a spectrum ,3,NOT
i should be the advocate  oh my,2,NOT
funny that theres more dislikes than there are likes ,2,NOT
did you even think this through please dont take decisions so fast without even thinking it though,3,NOT
nobody trisha i identify as a gay man oh shit ,3,NOT
sigh girl stop,3,NOT
i cant with her,3,NOT
oh lord help her,3,NOT
it really doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things just be you you dont need to convince anyone or explain yourself just be you and be with the people that bring out your true self instead of everyone being offended put yourself in someone elses shoes and try feeling what it is they are saying love do not judge,1,NOT
im not even going to finish this video already sounds dumb ,3,NOT

i love animals i have kept many animals as pets during my life dogs cats canaries parrots fish everything you can think of but going vegan is also killing animals indirectly what do you think will happen to the domestic animal breeds such as sheep cows chicken and to a lesser extent pigs and goats i am not judging you or saying that you are wrong for not eating meat its your choice i am just stating facts the current way of keeping domestic animals is cruel and it should be changed but eliminating meat from the diet of people is not the answer people dont eat dogs yet dogs suffer much more than farm animals to see what i am talking about i will give you an example i am mostly a catch and release fisherman but also i keep some fish you might say its cruel but i am contributing for the fish population much more than you who arent fishing or eating fish i pay a daily fee which is not cheap to fishthe law is that most of that money goes to fish stocking which means that thousands of fish are bred and released every year because of me and people like me so who is the real contributor to the wild waters here me or you  fish that is the daily limit on trout fishing are humanely killed to feed me and hundreds are released due to me,2,NOT
thank you for this documentary,1,NOT
i never eat meat in my life i was vegetarian now i am vegan,1,NOT
ik this is a vegan topic based video but you have to think of overpopulation and how to control it so instead of abused mass produced farm raised animals people who choose to eat meat could hunt for what they and their families consume its way better than all the wasteful ways of the meat production and its low in cruelly because the animals would develop in nature this would be hunting for survival purposes not trophy hunting,1,NOT

vegans need to understand the difference between factory farming and sustainable regenerative farming how many studies need to show a net positive on the environment from sustainable farming need to come out before vegans understand this i guess the lack of fats in their diets are harming brain function idk,3,NOT
its absolutely brilliant to see this review of the year i smiled and clapped and gave thanks for all of around the world who are making a positive difference wherever we can to promote vegan to the position as find ourselves in today it too often feels overwhelming to see all the suffering in the world and to feel an impending sense of doom seeing this has improved my mood and renewed my optimism roll on   may the revolution continue,1,NOT

i am vegan and love most of your postsvideos yet i am concerned this documentary will undo all the good done by the game changers fear based motivation is never as good as showing the benefits of change the first  minutes of gloom and doom extreme activists and the sad mad little icon of the hour greta are a big turn off to me and most people i know do you fly to the many conferences around the world you attend if like the environmentalist said we have had  previous environmental extremes that wipe out some species obviously they happened before coal planes trains automobiles and factory farming existed then who are we to be so egotistical to think we as humans are so significant our action or non action is going to stop the th maybe get back to focusing on the benefits,2,NOT

the planet is going to end whether we become vegan or not foolish thinking lol if you believe in god youll believe that it will end because he says it will if not then youll foolishly think mere human efforts will be able to eternally sustain and save a planet that was doomed from the beginning you cant save something you didnt create foolish we cant even save ourselves from dying foolish were subject to death and dying just like the earth eventually will be nothing lasts forever on this planet so why would the planet last forever foolish  thats not saying not to watch what you eat but the world is destined to wax worse and worse what shall mere food consumption within humans do against the hand of the lord shall his will not come to pass because of mans plan to save the planet this is so similar to the tower of babel event within the bible with mere human effort they desired to build a tower that reached heaven and tried and failed to launch attacks on god read the book of jasher chapter  dont you know that that arrogant plan failed we really think we can save the world but we in america alone dont even acknowledge god as god instead turn to god for world destruction under the lords hand is soon to arrive and those who endure abide in him and hide under his wing shall be saved,3,NOT

believe me being a vegan is terrific the cuisine is unlimited never ending options and all superb the fulcral part for me are the animals may ethics surge and compassion and finally the universal rights for animals may humans become humankind with this we will take a giant step to civilization the planet and our lives will begin a new reform and bring us a lifestyle which promotes the best in us,1,NOT
i hate industrial farming its pure horror but we are designed to eat meat but in a more humane way respectful and sustainable hunting being vegan wouldnt be possible without modern society such as b supplements or a mass of different fruits and veg being imported around the world to countries where it is not native hugh carbon footprint being vegan is being promoted despite its long term health issues because it is about control you cant survive being vegan unless you rely on the system you go off grid or be self sufficient you would die therefore is it not natural,3,NOT

human beings dont accept change easily sadly in this video it shows one group battling against the other group just like republicans and democrats people will eat meat until the end of time i guarantee it and youll never change their minds even though they have to take a handful of pills daily  as a result of their views lets all live peacefully as one and each have our own ways of eating,1,NOT

the main focus should be around peoples health everyone wants to be healthy on the other hand the majority of people dont care about the environment when they eat bottom line most people are selfish and dont give a  about anyone or anything that is not related to them process vegan food is not health promoting and being vegan is not the answer to optimal health whole foods free of chemicals and minimally process are the key most restaurants and chefs are all about how to deliver chemicals throughout food if you want to eat rice boiled it in water and eat it stop falling into the artificial stimulation produced by the saturation and processing of food throughout added chemicals we are not carnivores neither omnivores otherwise meat would be perfect and wouldnt cause any problem whatsoever the main objection of people to make a change in diet is the fear of missing the food they think they love but the reality is than they cant taste good food because they are saturated and their senses arent sensible enough after a terrible diet our taste improves dramatically over time after adopting a health promoting diet free of salty animal products sugar and oil find a way to demonstrate to people that they will not only be healthier but they will enjoy food like never before and realize that is nothing like sitting on the couch watching tv with the mind empty healthy people are more energetic and enthusiastic about food and that shows that is not the end of your happiness its the beginning,2,NOT
i became vegetarian when i was  and vegan when i was  today i m  veganism still is the best decision of my life,1,NOT

i love veganism and so does the earth and life living on it   ,1,NOT
this is dope as hell,1,NOT
climate changes hoxe,2,NOT
i have to say that as a video i think the this one isnt as good as the  and  videos not sure why could have just been my own state of mind or something but i feel like it was lacking something and was maybe a bit lacklustre somehow despite that this is still such a moving and inspirational review of the progress that has happened and i am still very happy about it ,2,NOT
i have been vegan for only  month and i am confused where the hell i was before best decision ever ,1,NOT
very good film eating crispy fried chicken while watching this,2,NOT
i have been vegan since  and definitely not going back to meat veganism is not just a trend is a lifestyle that benefits you and the planet in so many ways just by standing for our animals and our planet,1,NOT
el bien siempre triunfar  meses siendo vegano y sin duda una de las mejores desiciones que he tomado en mi vida,1,NOT
q how meat tastes me i dont know,1,NOT

the real criminality is the systematic torture and slaughter of billions of animals in the cruelist filthiest most sadistic conditions,2,NOT
 yeah right i remember when the ceos of the major cigarette companies stood before congress and with up held hand swore to almighty god that cigarettes were no more addictive than milk liars and money grubbers,3,NOT
vegan farmer here i grow most my own food myself and also grow for hundred more i hardly use any resources to do this it is liberty that allows me to do this so please stop with this unfounded climate alarmist propaganda the earth is not dying in a few years and using children to scare monger is exploitation time we stand up for the individuals liberty and influence the world to make positive choices by setting examples not by force,1,NOT
this sort of video is exactly what people need vegans rallying together and being happy that theyre making positive changes for themselves animals and the environment even if it isnt perfect sometimes  people make mistakes instead of having that horrible elitist mentality and bullying other vegans for not being vegan enough lets face it we see way too much of the later and it harms the movement rather than helping it,1,NOT
and may god save our planet and those with morals who live a plant based lifestyle because nothing will save those who take part in animal cruelty and consumption,2,NOT
how do i go vegan if i am young and live with my parents they cook me dinner and serve meat and dairy do i have to wait till im older,1,NOT
is guy at  the teacher off willy wonker lol,2,NOT
there is no wage gap if there was a wage gap wouldnt places only hire women its a matter of carrier choice,2,NOT
 wait so we need to feel sorry for women making k and we all know that there is an effort gap between the genders men tend to work more hours sacrifice more personal time to climb that ladder there is nothing stopping women from doing this and some women do and they are very rich but most women dont want to put in the effort,3,NOT
i want to know why both genders are making k one year out of school that is absurd,2,NOT
thanks for not blaming sexism and doing some more reasearch,1,NOT
 this has been debunked so many times,2,NOT
there were results from some other physical locations that showed women earned more than men i dont know,2,NOT
good job vox the video is both factually correct and proposes the solutions to solve the gender gap that exists in the same profession on the same position this an intellectually honest and interesting video the problem is that it will not solve the infamous  cents to a dollar since women will still be more likely to take part time job or be home stay mother and against what feminists say it is valid and respected choice so this  should be dropped all together,1,NOT
it makes sense if women want to get paid as much as men they should do a good of job if they do and are discriminatated because of having children then its the companies fault,2,NOT
most people miss the fact that its all fake,3,NOT
your intonation sucksyou are very annoying,3,NOT
ooooooooooooor your boss might pay you by your skills and efficiency and not what you have under your pants i mean just maybe,3,NOT
solution move to sweden,1,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap is that there isnt any this gender gap myth doesnt take into effect hours worked type of job full time part time also the fact that women dont particular do the same jobs as men and if they do they dont work as long as men do women like nurturing and office roles that are best suited for them you know jobs that are not particularly dangerous no women out there are gonna break their back doing a real man job like construction just ask any sensible women and if they say they do theyre lying simple as that,3,NOT
equal pay act of  look it up,2,NOT
did vox read the study they posted in their description the study states that  of the wage gap of mbas is a result of differences in mba courses taken and gpa differences in career interpretations and weekly hours worked that reduces the wage game to  a direct quote from the study fifteen years after obtaining their ba women who earned an mba had the lowest labor force participate rate the lowest share working full time and full year and took the greatest amount of noneducational time off from employment compared with others having professional degrees and phds vox if you want to discuss the wage gap and present your view on it then at least reference a source that supports your view and not one that opposes it,2,NOT
im confused why people comment refuting the gap when the video confronts most of the arguments people use to disprove its existence that study of those graduates from business schools makes it seem pretty concrete that for one reason wemon typically working less hours due to social pressures that make them more likely to handle the bulk of child rearing or another out right discrimination it exists,1,NOT
glad she didnt say patriarchy once,1,NOT
age gap doesnt exist its hours and choice of jobs just because overall and collectively gatherd woman are getting less money than men becausewell its simple more men are in higher paying job also its illegal to have a pay gap its simple,3,NOT
why focus on the jobs and not the lack of male parenting,2,NOT
you know you can dislike it without watching the video yet if its vox,3,NOT
i would be very interested to see a study of the correlation between assertiveness and aggressiveness with income the more driven and assertive and confident you are the higher your income seems likely to be assertiveness and aggressiveness are linked to testosterone men have demonstrably higher testosterone levels i think the wage gap is as simple as biology,2,NOT
the wage gap is a lie stop lying  its been illegal to pay women less since the s in america see equal pay act of   comparing someone that works housekeeping or in a call center to a banker or ceo is intellectually dishonest  any earnings gap is due to hours worked someone who works only  hours a week will always take home less than someone who works  hours a week amount of years with employers who give annual raises also effect earnings in companies that dont automatically give yearly raises and where a person has to ask for a raise if you dont ask you only have yourself to blame for not getting a raise  businesses are in it to make money if the wage gap was real the bottom line would argue that only hiring women would be in the businesses best interest,3,NOT
do we need to shrink it,2,NOT
the reason women often bear the responsibility of raising children is because they are better at it also why is it that nowadays stay at home moms are looked down upon its a hard job no doubt but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the traditional family structure where the man works and the woman takes care the kids for goodness sakes people it works better that way in most cases,2,NOT
thats funny she didnt go over any of the occupations where women earn more than men like modeling waitressing stripping hooking,2,NOT
the wage gap is a myth,3,NOT
after watching this feministic preach imma go watch some f me like you hate me on ph wish me good luck,3,NOT
this on the right path by looking in to specific data that goes into the grossly misleading wage gap but even this draws ways too easy and broad conclusions there needs to be flexibility to account for the variety of working decisions woman make throughout their career the main focus should be on educating girls that they should be excited for any job that catches their eye like how nurses are still a taboo job for men we have to get girls visualising themselves succeeding in male dominated roles elsewhere we should all be sharing info on our income to help all us in negotiating better salaries this should help disclose any lingering gender pay inequities as for the family thats up to the family to figure out if they want to have kids and this vid is promoting sexism by saying just mums have to work around their kids if thats how it is in your family thats your choice at the very least thats a social cultural issue not a pay work issue,2,NOT
if you take all of the money earned by women and compare it to all of the money earned by men you will arrive at the conclusion that women earn  of the money that men earn once you factor in for educational choices women tend to choose socially oriented fields while men still overwhelmingly make up those who choose stem fields career investment women tend to time more time away from their career to raise families and time spent working men tend to work more overtime than women do that gap narrows to nil want to make a ton of money choose a stem degree work  hours a week for  years and never get pregnant,2,NOT
when women can force men into or out of fatherhood without any ability on the part of the man who will be saddled with alimony even if he never wanted a kid it makes sense theyd have to take care of it more more rights more responsibility,3,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap nothing,2,NOT
o so now its the jobs women work at and the way they choose to work   i thought it was misogyny and patriarchy ,3,NOT
perhaps the answer isnt so much more flexible hours but rather that men be more involved in their childrens lives,1,NOT
they also miss that in the military men perform more work for equal pay work equals amount of pushups and setups performed and run times on pt test in this example specifically,3,NOT
ive never heard so much vocal fry in one video,3,NOT
what about the race wage gap the state wage cap the introvertextrovert wage gap there is simply no way to make every single category of people earn the same average amount this is a nonissue in every context,3,NOT
people seem to miss its not real,3,NOT
she has the iq of a fire ant,3,NOT
talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice its my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legallybinding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality given the fact that lawmakers ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation,3,NOT
two words divorce settlements,2,NOT
wow finally a video designed to make everyone mad,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap it doesnt exist,3,NOT
this is a real explanation of the wage gap if you watched the video you would realise that they are blaming personal choices and not discrimination watch before you dislike,2,NOT
you facist idiots the gender wage gap has been debunked several times,5,ABU
why do you say female pharmacists make  of what male pharmacists make thats not true they make  of what their male counterparts make for the same amount of hours if women work less then they get paid less thats the issue,2,NOT
wagegap statistics is what you get when you are a horrible scientist and dont know how to control for factors,3,NOT
heres the answer to your bullshit wage gap women have jobs that are not as hard to complete as what men will do they do the easy jobs then expect to get paid like a man working construction when have you ever seen a woman working on the job site laying bricks or shoveling dirt at a construction job never thats just an example it goes for more then just construction like my example was,3,NOT
number one thing people miss about the gender wage gap simple its not real,3,NOT
all these intelligent economists and they never come out and discuss these things dont they realize their opinion is highly valued why do i only see milo a troll albeit has facts but not an economist argue with dumb feminists i want to see a debate with a phd economist saying there is sexism vs no i probably wont understand most of it but it would be interesting there might not be any economists to even debate one side but thats the thing i dont know their opinions on it so i wouldnt know,3,NOT
yea the people miss that it doesnt exist,3,NOT
we know the wage gap is mostly due to womens choices,2,NOT
men need to step up and do more housework and child care so the work is split equally between men and women if that happened the wage gap would be much improved,1,NOT
you know if its a wage gap then why are the hours people work the defining factor is that not rather an earnings gap,1,NOT
people should be treated with respect people should be able to earn enough money to make a living,1,NOT
is the video just abruptly ending at  for anyone else,1,NOT
breaking news men are better than women,5,ABU
why are there so many dislikes,1,NOT
i dont think that wage and earnings should be conflated to the degree that discussion on this issue has caused,2,NOT
i was forced to write a paper on this topic last year for school i received a failing grade because she said the facts that i found and used didnt match her opinion,2,NOT
the gender wage gap is a myth,3,NOT
ororor we could start training young men and boys to start picking up their share of the child care and chores why does it have to be the womans job if men are equal to women then they need to man up and start acting like half their dna is in this child if men were able to say rearrange their tues and thurs schedules to make sure they were the ones to pick up the kids from school and take them to soccer practice and make dinner then the woman would only have to rearrange mon wed fri not to mention that if men were also held responsible for  of the care then businesses would have to start having more family friendly programs and hours because both fathers and mothers around  of the work force would be working around their babies just a thought,1,NOT
another thing is men are more likely to ask for raises or promotions than women so even if the man and the woman are doing the exact same work with the exact same hours and are both deserving of a raise a smart employer isnt going to just hand it out unless they ask for a wage or risk losing a valued employee,1,NOT
i think we can all agree that this is not as simple as companies dont pay women as much as men and i think we can all agree that if a company is intentionally discriminating against women something should be done about it but i think that is much more on an individual casebycase basis who cares about making the average full time salaries closer to each other that statistic means nothing as this video shows,1,NOT
so why should we want to shrink it if it is caused by a choice in priorities why not just leave women free to make that choice so long as there aware the consequence will be lower average pay,2,NOT
so the video is stating that we should go against nature and force farhers to share equal work of care of the child,2,NOT
none of this is relevant outside the usa,2,NOT
wait the graph at  is badly interpreted could be interpreted as more it contributes for the pay gap but it doesnt mean that an individual woman make less just about how many women to men work in that job it is important as these  fields are the best paid fields so the less women in this field in average women make less,2,NOT
childbirth there you go,2,NOT
omg a vox vid thats not sjwy,2,NOT
you are going to be a pretty shitty mother if you are at work all the time and paying a daycare to raise your young children,3,NOT
this issue will never resolve it self family life would have to reshape and women would have to see their time with children or their selves reduce to even out the numbers with men working full or part time women would have to value their time at work as much or more so than their social or family existence and firefighter is never going to be a flexible job for someone who isnt invested fully in it lots of things will never likely bend that much to an employees needs,2,NOT
nobody really gets rewarded for working exceptionally long hours  but they do extra hours pay more working on holidays pays more and working nights pays more how about we dont ignore the fact that men work longer hours,3,NOT
why arent men just kicked out work beacuse you can pay women less ,5,ABU
my wife makes  dollars more than me a year and we both have the same job,2,NOT
this is bs i work in healthcare and women make more then  of men you say women are not in high postion my don is a women where i work has  facility and the ceo of  of them are run by women so you wage gap is bsbsbs there are women of power look at nancy pelosi she is kill this country,5,ABU
i think we should all keep in mind that its also more difficult for women to get into higher paid jobs than it is for men not necessarily for lack of willingness though fewer women seek out certain jobs than men but from labour work to highpaid management positions males are more likely to be chosen by employers out of an equal pool of prospective employees and even sometimes when a woman has greater qualifications its a similar problem to how fewer africanamericans gain employment even when race ratio and education is equal across candidates i dont know if its just something society will grow out of or if something needs to be done to break the cycle of unequal opportunityunequal selection here in australia its not too bad given that state education is easily accessible and puts most kids on equal footing as far as modern education goes but still countless indigenous families cant get their kids the same opportunities because its so much harder for them to get a job due to discrimination theres still a widespread perception of aboriginals as welfare leeches and drug addicts that prevents them from finding work and in turn their children end up in a similar situation being unable to provide equal opportunity to their own families my point is its not always choice that creates earnings gaps between different demographics as much as we like to think our freedomloving firstworld countries provide equally abundant opportunities for everyone i just think we need to be mindful of that,2,NOT
thank you so much the world really needed this,1,NOT
men do work more hours than women,2,NOT
some interesting stats but seems oversimplified to me can you really dumb it down to how flexible the hours are,2,NOT
i am not sure why so many people arent into this its all just straight up facts,1,NOT
no no no no you fuc show me a specific job where women are payed less cause they are women and i will agree but missinterpreting graphs according to your own appeal just to show how everything is unfair wont do the trick,5,ABU
what people dont see is that its complete bullshit,3,NOT
good analysis but i dont like how making work hours more flexible is presented as the only solution the problem clearly lies within the social realm of men not feeling themselves as responsible for raising children and doing housekeeping stuff sure you can fight an issue on places different then the core but the main source of the problem is what really needs to be addressed in our society i believe,1,NOT
 cents to the dollar sounds about right after the missus takes her cut of my wages im left with about ,3,NOT
if the wage gap exists why arent companies hiring more women,3,NOT
if women dont have kids they will be free from the wage gap especially since they can sue companies for the difference the problem begins when feminism opens the barriers to motherhood and the workforce many women consider it normal to work and have kids yet end up with the burden they may get help from their spouse parents or a caretaker but feel the need to bond with their child  even if they are entirely free from their chores etc many women end up being stay at home mothers feminism says theres nothing wrong with it and that it should be a paid job the many ways feminism turn women into womb when they can simply be child free,3,NOT
there is no wage gap there is a payearnings gap,2,NOT
 people cant handle the truth,2,NOT
things i noticed you have a vocal growl that presents at the end of some sentences in a single word or end of a word usually multisyllabic words like instances grammar girl has one too for reference the word will drop in tone and be produced lower in the throat giving a little distortion to the word sounding like a growl lion tamer is now called lion trainer most crossword puzzle writers called constructors are men in prison with long sentences there are only about  that create all the puzzles books included you find my mother was an exception creating puzzles well into her s they become harder as the week progresses but not because the solutions are harder the clues become more obscure all crossword puzzles are diagonally symmetrical she was also a writer but changed her first name from julia to the initial j spelled jay because male writers were favored over female right out of the gate any major publisher can verify this she was also bostons first female insurance claims adjuster and fought the good fight to get that job many other male adjusters were livid they would even consider her she got her scuba certificate at  and pilots license at  while raising two boys on her own sorry to ramble but this seems to me relevant to the topic she found ways around the income gap renting rooms in our house typing for students and going back to school to get her masters in expressive psychotherapy at  the more ways across the gap the harder it will be to keep that gap open keep trying be creative and stay positive,2,NOT
so youre saying women should become lion tamers,2,NOT
notice the difference between the ratings of the video exposing wagegap patriarchy as bs and the buzzfeed video saying that the patriarchy oppresses womens wages oh wait buzzfeed disabled their ratings because they cant handle the truth,3,NOT
this video has an extraordinarily high proportion of dislikes ive never seen anything close to this on right leaning media other than fox news is vox the liberal fox,2,NOT
god i love you vox,1,NOT
in other words there just isnt one,2,NOT
there is a wage gap in between everyone the reason there is a gap is because everyone has different performances different shifts and different attendances you cant be making the exact same amount of money as your coworker if equal pay was actually a thing people that have bad performances are going to be paid as much as a person that has good performance would get and im not necessarily saying that women have worse performance than men one more thing i know a couple that worked in the same workplace different shifts but were the same hours and in the same department the lady makes about  more than her spouse and i guess its because he doesnt get things done sooooo yeah,3,NOT
im the weird guy watching vox at the bus stop,1,NOT
this is why america needs both maternity leave and paternity leave,1,NOT
mostly a good video its a shame the wage gap is often presented as evidence of misogyny if this werent the case i suspect many more people would be on board in finding solutions like more flexible hours or encouraging men to take a more active role in child care and other household duties we also need to make custody more equitable that would make men likely to take a more active role in their childrens lives,1,NOT
the main thing people miss about the pay gap is that it doesnt really exist there are laws preventing discriminatory pay what the  cents to the dollar myth comes from is a broad brush evaluation of what all men earn vs what all women earn apples to oranges when you actually factor in things like hours worked education and experience and the same career the wage gap disappears,2,NOT
just do like every army does and make standard pay grades legally required,1,NOT
the key taker here is that the wage gap isnt systematic its societal,1,NOT
so basically the wage gape hasnt anything to do with sexism why cant you put out an additional video informing people that its not mens fault  stop as people at the bbc are doing trying to circumnavigate mens earnings to women who earn less,2,NOT
on average women who do not have kids have a higher earnings over  years compaired to a woman who had kids gee i wonder why haha,2,NOT
 of this phenomenon is maternity plain and simple way to fix this is fix maternity leave,1,NOT
finally they actually acknowledge that women work less as they take care more with her kids and that what jobs the majority of a sex chooses this wasnt a bad video as it does cover everything,2,NOT
 things cause a gap in wages choice analytics and apathy the first of the main issues with choice of field of work was highlighted and dramatically reduced the gap secondly males by nature are neither the most emotional or caring of our race for this reason males make a great choice for doing rolls that are terrible eg garbage man trauma cleaner plummers etc and even in the same field compare a contracts or criminal lawyer against a family or immigration lawyer and there will be a higher number of males in the worse areas further because of the lack of emotional it makes the able to make decisions based on an analytical process rather than personal feelings at the same time these traits are terrible for someone that works in other roles such as child care nursing etc but thats not to say either side of our race is any better than the other it just means that different people are suited or enjoy different roles further not all males or females follow the inherent typical male or female ways of thinking which is solely why we do see male in roles that females enjoy and vice versa in actuality its not actually a problem not only because most people are married at some point and share their income or though logically we might actually want to enforce a pay gap for married men to be payed more to give mothers the option of being able to spend more bonding time with their children because children arent a burden they are something special to love and care for,5,ABU
i can in expecting third wave feminist professional victim garbage but i was pleasantly surprised by the actual facts and good arguments the biggest argument i have against the wage gap though is that if employers could pay women  less than men they would only hire women,3,NOT
my english teacher was talking about the pay gap i wanted to correct her but i didnt want to look sexist and i didnt want to get into argument with my english teacher,2,NOT
its been illegal to pay woman differently since the s,2,NOT
finally actual facts from vox and not just sexist racist and homophobe,2,NOT
jim jeffers can explain this in a better way,2,NOT
impressed by vox again you help me shut feminists up,2,NOT
what bothers me the most is that people seem to think the statistic means a single employer will pay their female employees less than their male employees,1,NOT
tldr the wage gap is a myth,2,NOT
there is no such thing as a gender wage gap people dont know the difference between wages and earnings,2,NOT
umm wtf did i just watch,3,NOT
i make a decent money but in my wifes and i social circle maybe   of the women make more money then me the women who dont are either stay at home mothers or dont have the same training experience that i do,2,NOT
want dads to care for the kids paid paternity leave and while were at it lets have paid maternity leave as well,1,NOT
it isnt a wage gap its an earnings gap women earn less because they provide less useful services to the people no one is going to pay you  to teach preschool no women want to grind away at an oil rig or learn math to become engineer college girls would rather party and go into education,5,ABU
proffesional stick figure or artist ,1,NOT
are there any studies on regular damn people is there a wage gap for people making less than k a year or is this a rich person problem,2,NOT
ben shapiro where are you,2,NOT
men consist of over  of workplace deaths,2,NOT
good job vox,1,NOT
its kind of funny how people are entirely missing the point of this video men are not doing their fair share of unpaid labor child raising tasks and chores resulting in women being forced to take jobs that dont have strict schedules while encouraging women to go into higher paying fields that dont have strict schedules is a bandaid to a chunk if the gender gap ignoring sexual harassment in male dominated fields like tech but that is a whole different issue that still doesnt get arround the fact that women are doing more than their fair share of paid and unpaid labor so we need a cultural shift toward men who actually act like parents,1,NOT
the wage gap is bullshit it is only there because men generally work over timetake less holidays retire at a later age and take more risks than women and if there was such a thing dont you think that companies would be hiring women instead to save money,3,NOT
what do people miss about the gender pay gap that there isnt one,3,NOT
we need to be aware of this if were gonna close the wage gap the only way youre gonna close the  gap that feminist keep harping on about is to either force women into higher paying jobs they dont want or force men into lower paying jobs they dont want,3,NOT
vox is far left propaganda the wage gap is a myth,3,NOT
the problem with this discussion is that people judge the value of a job based solely on the amount of money it gives anyone who has ever looked for a job knows that money is not the only thing one considers you also look at not only flexibility but also commute time travel requirements workplace environment risk of injury opportunity for advancement and many more what this means is that a woman can make less money than a man at the same job while still getting the same value from it even if there is a gender wage gap that doesnt mean there is a gender jobvalue gap,1,NOT
this comment section is appalling im assuming everyone here is high school educated wage gap  men work have higher paying jobs work longer hours etc remember what the equal sign means everyone the wage gap is the fact that men work higher paying jobs work longer hours etc yes theres still straight up discrimination that goes down but thats not the point we have a society and economy that accommodates men more so than women simply because women have kids take on more unpaid responsibilities associated with kids etc women are accommodated less in our economy solely due to the fact they are women and biologically have burdens that men do not birthing children this is a systemic issue not an individual issue  like the video clearly stated a good first step is to make hours more flexible in positions and make paid maternity leave federally legal and required for all women this way women can work longer hours higher payer jobs etc and close the wage gap the amount of misinterpretation in these comments is appalling this is why trump is president americans are dumb ,2,NOT
congratulations you work fewer hours than others expect less overall pay you work more hours than others expect more pay that wasnt hard to figure out,2,NOT
of course it doesnt exists this claim aims for the retarded feminists,5,ABU
scientists run experiments round the clock,1,NOT
i just wish feminists could see this video,2,NOT
the highest paid mayor in the usa is a woman i honestly think women will never be satisfied,2,NOT
feminists so often portray the wage gap as being about discrimination in the business sector probably because the gap is highest there the problem i have is how they insist on applying this to all men and all women those guys collecting garbage probably dont have it better than women working part time in a law firm but we kind of pretend they do everything has to be because of the patriarchy after all its all men oppressing all women rather than just people who have more opportunities being more likely to get high paying jobs,2,NOT
more flexible hours im in,1,NOT
they miss it because it doesnt exist,2,NOT
i usually dont like vox but this was well done,1,NOT
wait lol the woman in the video has a unshaven mustache,3,NOT
thank god that people in the comments in this braindead video do have a brain,3,NOT
how about google paying woman more then men didnt talk about that,2,NOT
earning gap not wage gap and there is nothing wrong with an earnings gap earnt implys you worked to earn more basically the foundation of capitalism you get out what you put in examplesuzie  brad both have a wage of hr both worked  hours however brad worked an extra  hours over time australian overtime rate  where as suzie went home to tender to her family for working  hours brad was payed  suzie however was payed  brad earnt an extra  but both have the same wage of hrdoes everyone understand now,2,NOT
when vox actual tells facts,2,NOT
so i take from this that the wage gap is a choice,2,NOT
finally this is getting around,1,NOT
the comment section going to be fun to read,1,NOT
vox failing at math again women dont make less than men they earn less than men men on average work longer hours get sick less take fewer holidays and dont have to push human beings out of their bodies its illegal to pay people different wages for the same job dummies,3,NOT
the wage gap does not exist,2,NOT
men and women make different choices women in the us do not all work and even if they worked women chose less paying jobs while men majoritaly make choices to work in businesses and ceos and take a whole different route than women bref women are more likely to work worst paying jobs while men work best paying this is factually correct vox doesnt know what is called facts the statistics of  cents to every dollar a man make doesnt account for each sex choses to work the sexes are different brain difference and social attitudes and now choices in life if you account for that the gap narrows to the point of vanishing edit this is a brief summary of tge response now about the topic or most of it of the video they dont account for most of these things  men work more hours than women because of that men are more paid than women this is not sexist this is common sense when someone work more that person get more paid men work more so they get more paid men often do the dirty work such cleaning  women often leave their jobs for maternity the statistics shows that they get paid less well did they account for the losing of jobs for mother purposes it is very factual that women leave their jobs raising kids more than men do for their children and even if they stayed as i said women work less hours after entering motherhood  in this video they talked about businesses and tech amd one more thing well these fields are dominated by men men are the majority of these fields women are not in fact out of the  worst paying jobs in the us  out of them are dominated by women while the other are men while out of the  best paying jobs in the us  out of them are majoritaly men and the other is women that statistics reflect the choices women and men do but wait does that proves sexism in the work place no that is because women dominate biology and medicine and single women are paid more than their male courter part however married women are paid less because they work less hours and even leave their jobs while men work more hours therefore are paid more they do the dirty jobs such cleaning the sewage and suffer from suicide overwhelmingly and in work men die more than women die in work,2,NOT
um its because there are more men workers than woman workers and they work more stupid liberal channel,3,NOT
just putting it out there maybe women just arent as smart,5,ABU
i work at a truck company with a woman that gets paid more than me why because she has more experience i dont complain,2,NOT
theyre right there is a lot that people miss about the gender wage gap such as men are more likely to work overtime men are less likely to take sick days even when sick men are less likely to use their vacation days men are more likely to ask for raises and more things there are reasons the wage gap exists and its not just sexism,1,NOT
clutural marxist propaganda,3,NOT
why is the lady complaing when she has that huge of a smile ,3,NOT
all the dislikes are those who dont like hearing facts,2,NOT
the way that woman spoke was so awkward,3,NOT
jesus i keep coming back here every couple days quit trying to math you guys you are just making stuff up everyone go back to schoolgo,2,NOT
since when was vox honest where are their daily doses of leftist bullshit,3,NOT
why men are so mad about this ,1,NOT
you neglected to mention that men often work more overtime than women and that some of the higher paying jobs that men take pay more because they are more dangerous and more likely to kill the men,2,NOT
if the wage gap is so large why do business not hire more women to cut costs,2,NOT
 k is not  less than k,2,NOT
wait that graph shows that one job in science earns more money when you are a female,1,NOT
encouraging flexible hours us something conservatives and liberals can get behind,1,NOT
my hourly wage is less than my supervisor i however have probably earned more money total than my supervisor since i stated this job  months ago is that somehow descriminate against my supervisor no thats my supervisor and myself being given the option to earn alot of overtime if we were willing to work the hours my supervisor chose to skip the extra hours except for when he absolutely had to work i however went  months straight of going to work every single day and then getting off days only sparringly and thats when they force me to take off my supervisor gets every weekend off but if you looked at only the end result of total money earned youd ask why is the supervisor earning less than someone positioned under them people who believe the wage gap idiocy will claim the supervisor is somehow being descriminated against when in reality as with the wage gap idiocy its because of our different choices,2,NOT
men need  kcalday women need kcalday men pay alemony men do heavier and more dangerous jobs women mostly work inside men use their salaries to buy shoes for work women buy fancy shoes men build the whole infrastructure of the country roads airport tunnels houses planes men get killed defending the country women bake cakes and spend  hour every day putting on their face women when you take on these tasks the you can ask for a raise therefore women earn more than men,5,ABU
theres only a wage gap because of womens individual choices its nothing to do with businesses underpaying stop being privileged and trying to demand money you havent earned,3,NOT
k is  less than k,2,NOT
men work harder get a higher job,3,NOT
i think they miss the part where the gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
also for the same job at the same company working the same hours woman make exactly the same salary if they made even  less they would sue and they would win it has been illegal for a long time trigger warning do not continue if you are a sjw uncensored logic ahead  ok would you risk losing millions of dollars to save  on a ish paycheck if you were a business owner have you ever ever ever ever seen a paycheck of a woman that is lower than the paycheck of a man if everything but sex is the same it would be on a loop at cnn for  months if they could ever find  just  case of gender pay gap,2,NOT
they fail to explicitly attempt to answer in detail why women make less thats the video we need,2,NOT
i think this issue is a lot more prevalent in higher paying jobs primarily due to this old boys league mentality have any of you ever seen the film goat its quite an interesting look into the world of fraternities and how they shape these old boys leagues that exist to this day in high power positions,1,NOT
unpopular opinion men and women are different,2,NOT
 while women were earning  less  on average that  of  not less,2,NOT
lmao at the dislikes  people dont understand how the world works,2,NOT
people miss the fact that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
well tell women to stop taking gender studies and major in something that will score them a job,3,NOT
at the end of the day this isnt a problem and the wage gap has nothing to do with discrimination but womens choices,2,NOT
here comes the dislikes,2,NOT
doesnt make guys the bad people,1,NOT
how come it always changes from c to the  c to the  etc wtf,2,NOT
men take more risks so on average they sometimes earn more,2,NOT
wage gap is a myth women like you sit around complaining about wage gap instead of working hard for that money you need,3,NOT
many people are misinterpreting this video it doesnt say that there is no wage gap but it says that when taking other factors like pregnancies and different career choices into account it shrinks from  to less than  and  is still too much,1,NOT
thank you for this report please learn how to talk without vocal fry and upspeak,3,NOT
the profession of teacher arguably the most important in the history of the world is overwhelmingly dominated by women yet ive never heard a man complain of the fact its interesting,3,NOT
a wage gap is a preferable alternative to communism,2,NOT
but theres no such thing as the wage gap,2,NOT
that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
so because women dont want to work odd hours we should make ice cream shops and law firms close earlier that makes no sense a woman is just as capable as a man of working shitty hours if women dont think its worth it thats their choice,2,NOT
feminism is cancer the wage gap is a myth women if you dont raise our children our society ends and the muslims will force you stay home and be nothing more than baby machines western women you are the most privileged group in history stop indulging your every whim and consider the society that gave you so much again feminism is cancer,5,ABU
doesnt anyone realise that the fact that more women would refuse to date a man who earns less than her pushes him to earn more men tend to have different preferences towards women,3,NOT
caution many trolls below drawn by the subject matter not worth reading the comments for any real intellectual discourse,1,NOT
while this definitely seems ever so slightly pro wage gap i do have to commend vox for approaching this issue very factually i think i may have to resubscribe,1,NOT
so the wage gap has nothing to do with inequality interesting thx vox,2,NOT
i wish they made it clear in the video that this pertains to white women,1,NOT
doesnt seem like a wage gap at all the way it was explained its appropriate pay for time in different sectors,1,NOT
you also forgot that they dont work as hard they work less hours and take longer vacations wether or not they had kids,5,ABU
there is no gender wage gap,2,NOT
lol based off of many comments people did not watch the video,1,NOT
vox doesnt understand the difference between wages and earnings,2,NOT
great video that shows that the causes are part of the system and social structure and not just an arbitrary pay gap,1,NOT
then again equality doesnt exist,2,NOT
lets help end this gap created by free will what lmao,2,NOT
 feminazissjw here cant accept facts,5,ABU
this is really interesting,1,NOT
if women got paid  less for the exact same work wouldnt companies only employ women cause itd be cheaper and theyd get the same results,2,NOT
always funny your propaganda,3,NOT
glad to see a left channel acknowledging that the wage gap is a choice by women through the careers they work and their choice to have children rather then systemic sexism where employers intentionally pay women less which believe it or not a lot of leftists and sjws believe,1,NOT
the only thing that i learned from this video is that scientists work self directed and i want to become one know,1,NOT
work hard as men get paid as men,2,NOT
you are false news,3,NOT
we just need to make men take on lower paying jobs and women take on higher paying jobs so then we can all be the same and collectively earn the same amount because otherwise its sexism  vox,3,NOT
the wage gap is not real,2,NOT
the beeping is going to give me an aneurism,2,NOT
you are operating on a faulty premise that men and women are the same if you accept were not it all starts to make sense women make different choices than men on average choices have opportunity costs a choice to prioritize family is a commendable one and naturally implies the deprioritization of career think about it,2,NOT
the wage gap is not a thing its simply comparing the average earnings of all women to the average earnings of all men it doesnt take into account hours worked over time holiday pay time taken off different jobs job positions it is not about gender it is not sexist,2,NOT
 business depends on the company and the economy if i work for a small business i will be paid less than a corporation  there is the equal pay act of  or  i always get the  years mixed up so you can sue  women usually work with jobs that are more for emotional reasons and a good chunk of them pay less than jobs like engineering  dont forget that part time jobs do pay less im just saying look at these things before saying there is a pay gap,2,NOT
so basically the wage gap is real but only because our society still hasnt figured out that womens purpose isnt to care for the kids,2,NOT
milo was right all along,1,NOT
a very nice and well put together video with a lot of great data there is just one problem all of it is about earnings not necesserily wage as a matter of fact it is illegal to discriminate on gender for the exact same job equal pay act  wether a difference in earnings is something that has to be corrected is therefore debatable i bet you could make a very similar chart for iq and get a difference in earnings not saying women are dumber then men that wouldnt be based on an outward characteristic the problem i encounter here is the idea that the desired goal is to have an equal pay across the bord regardless of extra hours worked negotiations in wage or sick days etc there are a lot of variables that strifing for equality of outcome as equalizing earnings would be becomes a case of holding back people that want and can do more in a sense it is opressing them by not allowing them to choose to excell wether man or woman doesnt really matter to me quotas and wage redistribution are not solutions,2,NOT
this entire argument is based on an equation that makes no sense i mean all full time workers in the us and you already stated that men go for the higher paying jobs and women favor lower ones thats like me setting up this bullshit with the guys and girls at my office then shockingly the girls make more because the owner is a women try getting data from people in the same field with the same level of experience and then well talk,3,NOT
there arent as many female billionaires right so that also counts to the statistic,1,NOT
does vox know the difference between earning and making i smell liberal arts degrees and spoiled middle class income brats,3,NOT
omg a woman is presenting the argumenttherefore shes a traitor to women cuz apparently all women must share the same opinion sarcasm,2,NOT
well its vox ladies and gentlemen  why would i expected  trash journalism at it finest,3,NOT
women choose to make less money than men then women choose to complain about their choices then they choose to argue that it is not their fault that they voluntarily made choices that they understood women that argue that this exists actually just think that men are superior and that women need special treatment,5,ABU
congrats you just lost a subscriber,2,NOT
i like how there was an assumption that the flexible hours issue was all because of a child dont mind the fact that more childless women still prefer to work a more standard time schedule than childless men or men with children yeah also there is an absolute crap ton of other reasons for the earnings gap,3,NOT
there are so many factors that are not included for example how many woman were followed and how many man more woman means more chance a woman will land a high paying job that raises the average,2,NOT
i did like this but i would also add that most mothers naturally have a strong bound with their children witch will lead most women to take more time off of work instead of the man that normally doesnt have a strong of a bound as the mother dose this normally stems from welli women gives birth and carrys the child for  months some women breast feed witch create a vary strong bound a bound that a father cant grow with his child and it can even take a new father a few weeks to even a few months to really feel like a father it just takes men more time its just nature theres a reason why people say women should stay home with the kids and men should go out this tradition has been around sense forever the mothers stayed home kept the kids happy and safe while the father went out and got food times have changed  so women should have choice to work or not to ,2,NOT
rights men have that women dont sorry this folder is empty,2,NOT
the pink tax is the retarded cousin of the wage gap conceived by incest of marxism and feminism enjoy your cancer red pills for the rest of us,5,ABU
wow a video that states moreof the facts,1,NOT
everyone in the comments who is blindly saying that the wage gap is a lie is a moron it exists it is just far smaller than the  ratio that is usually shown and is closer to  this amount albeit much smaller has been entirely credited to workplace sexism by experts,3,NOT
my parents each worked and each got a great and equal pension my father died  years ago my mother is still collecting his and her pension wage gap,2,NOT
why we should fight for just women rights and not for men and women where are my rights as a man i lost my rights this is so inequality we as humans should fight for human rights not a certain gender,2,NOT
there is nothing wrong with traditional gender roles where the husband is responsible for providing and the wife is responsible for caring millennia of history and simple biology tells us that is a strong and efficient default family structure that has kept our species alive this long if thats what a couple wants that shouldnt be a topic for a feminists protest sign just because raising children doesnt get you a paycheck money is not the most important thing in the world even though many people think so on the flip side i do also believe that if both husband and wife want to break from traditionbiology and are both providing then both husband and wife should be caring as well its all about a balance and the  on each side is not what its all about its about a happy and functioning home with what the people inside that home consider an egalitarian division of responsibilities regardless of a wage gap people would do well to establish this before deciding to marry andor have kids so they dont just let life happen to them and become unhappy in their home and channel their discontent into an internal hatred of whatever system or movement they think is keeping them down smart choices planning your life and personal responsibility will do wonders,1,NOT
you guys are bad and you should feel bad,3,NOT
its the opposite now,2,NOT
so basically one of the main reasons for the pay gap is because women take care of the kids what a twist there are also other factors that greatly inflate the most commonly sighted statistic i also noticed that the graph showing wage gap distribution between different types of occupations ranges from  and  while this video is pretty biased its at least well researched and has some useful information so long as you take it with a grain of salt just be aware that they only covered a small part of the problem and said problem tends to be greatly exaggerated and now i realize that this video came out  years ago and im probably gonna be blasted from both sides of the argument if this comment section is still active,2,NOT
this video is intentionally being intellectually dishonest,3,NOT
sorry my english i have never ever in my life got paid more than my female co workers who has the same seniority level and same kind of work the only time i have got more salary than some others is because i have worked more overtime but the same goes to as women as well i am so sick and tired of man hating feminists or feminists in general who always have to claim obscure things,3,NOT
i own a business and have men and women working for me women have beautiful work ethic much better work ethic than men but when it comes to physical tasks in our place i find men usually can work harder for longer periods of time but not always true but i believe thats why men are paid more though theres a higher demand for male employees i have better success in my business hiring males over female but we do a lot of physical labor i hire women for jobs in my business that i need people to be more trustworthy and meticulous however,2,NOT
ok the wage gap does exist but not because of inequality it exists because women tend to not work as much as men do either due to children or by choice,2,NOT
gender war in the comments warning scroll down if you dare,2,NOT
yeah maternity leave and overtime affect a lot maybe if you used better databut nah google found the wage gap affected men negativley and they had to give raises,2,NOT
it is not a wage gap it is an earnings gap,1,NOT
theres a difference between wage and earnings you know,1,NOT
why dont men take care of the children,1,NOT
how are there so many dislikes when the comment section seems to be in agreement,1,NOT
vox whats wrong with you it wasnt ultra liberal,2,NOT
or we could just leave the wage gap as is and let women be dependents,5,ABU
im just glad the word patriarchy wasnt used so i listen and shes got some pretty valid points i think,1,NOT
the wage gap itself completely wrongbecause it doesnt exist the study was conducted by looking at the the wage of women and the average amount they earn a month compared to a man but they didnt take in many factors like bonuseshours offpositions of jobsect also on average women take more time off its a commonly studied statistic used to prove the wage gap wrong men work more hours and take more overtime than women on average women take more time off and the wage gap itself is illegal,2,NOT
so what you are saying is that there is no wage gap and that women and men get payed equally for the same work,1,NOT
blimp pilot really vox,2,NOT
asian wage gap is so bad white people make less than them wtf man white supremecy back in action we need to take our country back from the asians,5,ABU
how about we end all affirmative acton so employers know that they are getting the real deal and not a dunce who got a leg up then lets begin a huge public shaming campaign for women who fail to earn enough maybe we can tattoo deadbeat or loser across their forehead lets have a media campaign talking about how a woman who cant support  kids and a husband without him having to work isnt a real woman lets saddle women with all the responsibility for supporting the family or face being branded losers not worthy of life lets make it so a woman has to earn a certain amount to qualify for any consideration at all for romance yep lets reduce the entire worth of women to their paycheck then lets see if that old pay gap doesnt vanish faster than a candy bar at a fat camp,6,ABU
you dumb feminists need to learn this if women are paid less than men why are companies not hiring women then and saving money on salaries it would only make sense right why would an employer purposefully want to pay more to a guy when they can a woman to do the same job for less this is capitalism folks and your fukin tricks on how the wage gaps are a sexism thing is actually nuts,5,ABU
vox would never make a video like this in  theyre really far left now,2,NOT
this video surpassed my expectations,1,NOT
so i get to be paid as much as a man when im  yaaaaayyyyy progress,1,NOT
so in summary for you lazy twats watching the wage gap is formed by the hours and availability of the worker and this generally correlates with gender no feminist bollocks lovely,3,NOT
the vocal fry is strong with this presenter very irritating,3,NOT
 of the  year olds saying the wage gap doesnt exist dont know that the video agrees with them its a good idea to watch the video first then comment,2,NOT
glad to see vox actually made an objective video for once that looks at both sides and only reviews facts and logic good job guys,1,NOT
so women get paid less because they become unreliable when they have kids how is that sexist i think women have a natural instinct to want to be with their kids of course its already becoming more popular to have stay at home dads,2,NOT
is a vocal fry required to be a white feminist,3,NOT
see all we need to do to fix the wage gap is make work more accommodating for women ,1,NOT
this argument does not make any sense you are comparing wages from a variety of fields instead of one corporation how about you focus on individual firms and see how much of a myth the wage gap is,2,NOT
lol  wage gap is a myth,2,NOT
she also forgot different educations what school they went to grades from that school along with which degree and that there are more men in specific higher paying fields stem fields to be more specific so the  cents yo the dollar become  cents to the dollar and there are more variables that can be taken into account that just arent one being kids income and how many women who dont work and how many men dont work which can put it in the range of being  cents to the exact same payment in all honesty if there is a sexism variable in here its minute and insignificant because there is a law against it,2,NOT
shame you missed the factors that were not taken into account in this study namingly location of the job think the dif between new york and alabama choice of job they followed mba graduates for the study cited but an exec at a bank will make more than an exec at a company with  stores hours worked per week in thomas sowells study which took these into account the pay gap between men and women was at most  cents on the dollar with the female working  less hours per pay cycle additionally in most jobs where a woman was unmarried and had no kids she tended to outearn an unmarried no kids male by a large margin by  years post graduation,2,NOT
i bet we can play spot the feminist in this comment section,2,NOT
i work hrs a week my female coworker works  because of her kids and school yet shes a poor defenseless women and makes less bs,3,NOT
isnt the paygap just a yield gap that has been misread,2,NOT
feminists may believe women make  less then men but really feminist are just  stupider than the average person,5,ABU
get courses other than gender studies and work full time as men does and gender gap will disappear,3,NOT
not wholly related to the video but too many people are worrying about gender pay gaps yet even if it was realwhich it is not why are we prioritising over this when  percent of suicide victims are men if it was women instead we would all care right but its men so who cares there are also many other problems men face that are not spoken about,2,NOT
wow k people are triggered,2,NOT
this is good journalism other vox reporters take note back up your claims with real facts and research and you will be better received,1,NOT
i find it incredibly hard to believe that a women and a man could go for the same job and some lazy dude would get paid more than an intelligent and hard working women just because he is a man like why would anyone waste their money doing that,1,NOT
why is the narrator crying,2,NOT
boi leftisy stop,2,NOT
reads the title me that it doesnt exist any who pls be more realistic vox men stay in work longer studies over short  long periods of time show men are more likely to ask for raises and ask for more hours its statistically proven that woman take more leaves then men on a  scale this also doesnt account for that nearly the entire part time work force strictly consists of woman why should an employers pay a part timer as much as a full timer woman in theyre twenties and forties are out partying and going through jobs until they finally settle down with someone when they start to have a kid its only till near retirement age when this so called gender age gap is nonexistent because men and woman are working full time at the same rate you idiots forget to look at presented facts because you know the gender pay gap is baloney no serious economist not even female economist take this gender pay gap serious the new third reich yes i said that of feminism is unneeded its just an escape hole for feminist to bash men if we paid woman less then why wouldnt we just hire all woman exactly woman in the science field are more likely to get the job then a man trying for the same job with the same qualifications on a  scale woman in the st century are privileged yet complain about other peoples privilege and the best part is you think you can change things bahahah the first and second wave of feminism is what i agreed with this third wave is just pure bs this is why god brought the flood there is no such thing of a gender pay gap its utter bullshit,5,ABU
they are still trying to push this false narrative its been disproven and explained thousands of times by now how many more times are needed they are seriously starting to sounds like creationists or climate change deniers at this point refusing to accept any sort of evidence and studies,3,NOT
im sorry i have not heard of this thing called the wage gap is this possibly because it no longer exists,2,NOT
theres probably so many fake npcs in this chat saying that the gender pay gap is real,2,NOT
uh what about the wage gap between white and black people,1,NOT
you can fire all man and employe only woman because they are cheaper  when were yours geniuses and they did predicteding crisis in  you are only liars,3,NOT
what people miss is that it doesnt exist and its been that way for almost  decades its incredibly disrespectful and horrific to our ancestors who actually lived in a world and country were they were treated as an inferior property of men if you want your statistics to look exactly the same take away all mothers children stop lying and spreading these lies to the generations to come you should be deeply ashamed and also get a life,3,NOT
so women should find jobs can work flexible hours instead of asking men to take their own responsibility for the family,2,NOT
am i only the man that makes less then females do i survive on k per year and my sisters one makes k per year and the other k per year the money goes round and round for people lel,2,NOT
why do not all companies employees be women because their salaries are lower,2,NOT
the centsonthedollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women working fulltime by the median earnings of all men working fulltime in other words if the average income of all men is say  dollars a year and the average annual income of all women is say  dollars that would mean that women earn  cents for every dollar a man earns  divided by  equals  but these calculations dont reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesnt take into account occupation position education or hours worked per week even a study by the american association of university women a feminist organization shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only  cents when you factor in different choices men and women make and the key word here is choice the small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less let alone with sexism it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make,1,NOT
what about the fact that men are  times more likely than women to die in the workplace why does nobody talk about that,1,NOT
there is no wage gap however there is a earnings gap after becoming pregnant women work less hours then men so they get paid less than men,2,NOT
if i had one dollar for every gender i would have ,2,NOT
theres so much more to life than money,1,NOT
i thought this was supposed to be about the female gap,1,NOT
i hate the sound of vocal fry it ruins important informative videos like this,3,NOT
where is death at workplace gender gap,2,NOT
work same hours get same money,2,NOT
i think the difference between men and women is a load of balls,3,NOT
wheres the proof,2,NOT
well women arr biogicly purposed to take care of kids they dont have to but it would help the child if they did a littlw morw than a man,2,NOT
if gender wage gap is real why dont just every company hire women then so much cheaper that would be,2,NOT
yeah i dont get it  is not   im not a feminist im just looking for a good aregument against the claims of a wage gap but apparently its an actuall thing,1,NOT
this is a very reasonable exposition of this issue,1,NOT
still abnormal as all your dots from the graphs you show are below the zero line meaning theres a tendency anyways towards wage gap which is the problem  it is not about how big of a gap it is about the fact that there is one where there shouldnt be any,1,NOT
i as a man am furious the gender pay gap is real and it effects us all scarlett johansson made  million dollars this is just not right i only made  i am outraged by this horrific statistic and clear assault on my gender im not an actor and i dont particularly work hard but thats not the point she made millions and me basically poverty im two bad financial decisions from being homeless and all because im a man i cant wait for the pendulum to swing back my way and give me my just due,3,NOT
i remember sometime last year one of my female classmates complained about the wage gap to which i said you along with  of university students in this building are art students if you want to tilt the scales get out and stop being a visual arts student the only way women can tilt the scales if they leave the humanities and peruse more demanding careers most of them in that art building arent even good artists anyways waste of money for them,3,NOT
its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,2,NOT
i like how women born in the mid s had close to earning parity with men maybe that had something to do with all the men being killed in some sort of war or something,2,NOT
in soviet union we didnt have this problem called rising intonation,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist unfortunately for all of you feminists who just want to get paid more than they do without actually earning it,3,NOT
well if women worked harder and worked to their full potential then they would earn more,3,NOT
so the video says what everyone knows men are more willing to take on higher risk longer hours graveyard overtime and spend more time with their job for higher pay women are more likely to take on part time easier hours and a more limited job scope we get it theres no such thing as a wage gap thats just misinformation about individual preferences,3,NOT
vox the reasonable arguement didnt get their facts from biased sites buzzfeed the crazy feminist that did no research got facts from biased websites not so reasonable,2,NOT
woman most often choose to take care of their children woman also work less hours in total then men plus you know its illigel to pay employees less due to gender look it up site some sources grow up there are real problems like the famine in africa etc,3,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working fulltime it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,1,NOT
let the private businesses and companys pay whatever they want if you dont like the pay move on,3,NOT
looks like i have to deal with this untrue misleading garbage just to watch the interesting stuff you post,3,NOT
question for most of your charts the yaxis is littered with s or s and i want to know what they mean,1,NOT
the biggest thing that no one has mentioned is the fair pay act of  it is illegal to pay some one less for the same job my question is why there are not lawsuits for breaking the law oh because only like  have been filed so far and more than half of those were found not true,2,NOT
shouldnt the conclusion of this be maybe women shouldnt be expected to earn the same as a man while also having to shoulder the majority of the burden at home maybe men take on more domestic responsibility or accept that they may have to provide more financially if they expect their wife to run the home and raise the kids,2,NOT
so whats the solution to this problem my liberal comrades use government power to force men to stay at home and take care of the kids more or force employers to change schedules so we can fit them around womens needs or better yet both,2,NOT
take note women  men arent worth a fart,3,NOT
i cant believe fox posted the truth for once,2,NOT
despite saying all this in the video im still viewed as sexist when i shoot down  of the pointd feminists try to use and fully supported the other  and to tell them things arent as bad as you are trying to say it is even though there is things that need to change still stuff like this is why i stopped supporting feminism,3,NOT
that it does not exist,2,NOT
i dont care about this video at all but color in your bar graphs correctly for crying out loud,2,NOT
number of female ceos  too damn low number of female coal miners just fine,2,NOT
this is surprisingly neutral its a refreshing change,1,NOT
there is no freaking wage gap u are so dumb oml,3,NOT
there are two sides to it the gap on different fields is what people look at but women tend to go into lower paying jobs to begin with but then there is the argument that if a man and a women are doing the exact same job and lets say they started on the exact same day and can work the exact same amount of hours the man still seems to make more over all,1,NOT
what people miss is theres the fact that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
so your pretty much saying the wage gap exists becuse females tend to be less flexible becuse they have to take care of the family more often,2,NOT
so in a nutshell its not sexism,1,NOT
come on you want to get rid of schedules just so that wives can be worked to death easier why cant we just work to create an environment where women dont feel like they have to be a slave to their husbands theres no reason they should take the majority of the work raising children unless they want to that is but still i dont like the idea of saying oh you want to work two jobs give up on all your dreams slave away in the kitchen while your husband and children watch tv okay then lets help you make that possible,1,NOT
there is no gap if you consider habits hours education experience take a men and a women that have everything above the same they earn the same money for the same job why did you hide that in this video,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap it doesnt exist the end  second long video,2,NOT
would like to see that pretty cool looking wage gap diagram at  minute mark for men and childless women hell include all  if you want no need to have the x axis being average pay,1,NOT
this is way better than that horrible liz plank video you did on this same subject a while back,2,NOT
make k im male what about muh wage gap or how a woman in the same job gets  percent less pay but gets more health care coverage,2,NOT
that vocal fry tho,3,NOT
chef is definitely not a job with flexible hours that being said i really enjoyed this video thanks vox,1,NOT
good job vox interesting info with facts that comments against common notions instead of just following them a good step in the right direction,1,NOT
female tennis players earn the same in major tournaments for less work,2,NOT
imagine earning  dollars and still complain that u earn less than men,2,NOT
the problem is that in the current american culture we keep wagesalary a secret somehow thinking that its shameful or private or something and putting a huge taboo on revealing what we are paid to our coworkers when i worked a job that gave me access to payroll data i was shocked how much salaries varied between people doing exactly the same job who had identical experience and tenure when there are many jobs like that then the statistics become hard to extract the gender wage gap from the overall inexplicable wage disparities if every company published how much it paid each employee then we could figure out the breadth and depth of the gap,1,NOT
my dad makes more than my mom doing the same engineering job they always meet the minimum production rate they dont grade production unless d or f which neither has gotten my mom hasnt taken maternal leave my dad i think yes he had to my sister to and from school even sporting events while my mom never went unless in the car with him hours dont matter as long as you are close to  or met  hours shes not going to complain when she loves her jobs and has multiple friends,2,NOT
its a myth if girls were truly paid less buisnesses would hire only women bc they would have to pay less,2,NOT
literally just listen to the first  seconds of this video,2,NOT
i find it interesting how this video could also tie in with the lack of paid maternal and paternal leave women who take time off for a baby do not have to be paid leading to the wage gap yet someone has to bring in money so men are expected to work even if they want to stay with their child its a bad situation all around,1,NOT
male stripers dont get paid as much as female stripers,2,NOT
hey it must be sad to have a job where you study something that doesnt exist,3,NOT
lol idk why i clicked this but pls tell me if this is another dumb feminist or someone normal i dont want to get cancer,3,NOT
and the comments are a war zone why am i not surprised whats interesting is that shes basically saying similar things that christina hoff sommers has said in a video i saw a while ago its similar points but their conclusions are different this video has more stats and research if you all are getting upset about findings that academics have made cause of their research then im not really sure what to say to you,1,NOT
tldr there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap meaning all men put together earn more than all women put together which is because men work higher paying jobs more dangerous jobs and more hours for the same exact work and same exact hours men and women are paid the same,1,NOT
the thing is it doesnt exist woooaaahhh,2,NOT
whats also missed is that as men are progressing up the career ladder many of their female counterparts are taking time off work to have children no woman is going to be offered a raise then,3,NOT
if the wage gap existed where men make say  an hour and women make  an hour then why not only hire women why pay men the extra  when you can save that by paying only women,2,NOT
here in new york women actually outearn men,1,NOT
that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
why do you hate women raising the children,2,NOT
i make the same or less then all the women i work with but not a one of them will stack a palette of  pound boxes you want a pay gap to go away then get rid of the work gap,3,NOT
what do they miss about the wage gap it doesnt exist,2,NOT
i took from that last seen a female lion tamer female ice cream taster and female writer should make the same as a male doctor seriously,3,NOT
its more complex than the  cents figure ok but the unfounded assumption that there is a problem and that its unfair to women is still just asserted because i guess thats the culture we live in you have to wimminworst,2,NOT
im just gonna put this out here  dollars is not  less than ,1,NOT
 is not  less than  at most its  of ,1,NOT
women choose to do more for children because generally they like taking care of kids and men like working more hours and being the bread winner,2,NOT
i thought your salary except government depends on your negotiation skills,2,NOT
incorrectwoman are paid the same there was an entire law put in for this situationidiots,3,NOT
questionif women get paid less then men wouldnt it be advantageous for a business to hire just women in order to save on operating costs ,2,NOT
so what youre saying is that because of the disproportionate amount of women in lower paying fields andor raising children working less or innumerable other circumstances that prevent them from working in higher wage employment or recieving bonuses or raises  statiscally speaking the wage gap doesnt really exist,2,NOT
it doesnt exist,2,NOT
huh i went to the most liberal biased news source i knew of and im impressed vox covered this very well and i dont feel as if its biased,2,NOT
she just explained why the wage gap doesnt exist,1,NOT
it has a lot to do with aspirations upbringing and education environmentlocationprivelege and even career choice obviously an underwater welder who works a week welding under the ocean for full  hr day and living on site for a full week and going home for another two or what have you will make more than a chick who just goes and does nursing women tend to take far less risks especially when it comes to their lives knowinglyconsciously anyhow there are jobs that pay danger pay i can guarantee you will find a largely male workforce for said types of employmentcareer thank you vox for being reasonable and having some common sense,1,NOT
the comments are filled ignorance smh,2,NOT
so basically it does not exist,2,NOT
its almost as if men and women have different preferences and are more inclined to make different life choices haha,2,NOT
youll get paid as much if you do as good a job,2,NOT
sorry  is not  percent less than  it is  of  or  less obviously semantics but it changes the of the statistic pretty heavily,1,NOT
youre so close vox i can see it in you youre so close to realizing that wage inequality is not a bad thing,5,ABU
what i got from the video is that men need to actually start taking care of kids i mean  to  yeah the  left are equal but still thats pretty stingy considering you have a  chance of having things fair or having to do more work,1,NOT
we also miss why there is sbout  reasons,1,NOT
women working arent attractive at all sorry dried up cat ladies,5,ABU
the only word that needs to come after wage gap is myth vox is fake news,3,NOT
moral of the story you cant have everything,2,NOT
finally an intelligent video  it get many things wrong and miss some things to consider but holy moly finally a feminist video that uses logic instead of feelings  thank god vox keep it going,2,NOT
there are some rare fields that women earn more then men like construction but they also make up less than  of the workforce so like small victory mmmhhhh ,1,NOT
but does it matter,2,NOT
so according to the comments we either live in a perfect society where every single person is hardwired to treat everyone in the exact same respectful way or we live in a society where we have a male dominant entity that hates women and makes employers pay women less nevermind facts and details nope facts dont matter one side must be the unquestionable truth and research doesnt matter unless it contains a catchphrase that vaguely backs the agenda i support,2,NOT
i think most people already knew this save radical feminists who think its all about sexism and extreme sexist men who think there is no sexism,3,NOT
i use to like vox before yhis,3,NOT
omg the vocal fry is out of control,3,NOT
conclusion kids are to blame ,2,NOT
 k  after business school and kk after  years is this harvard or something this seems like an awful lot,1,NOT
people also miss that there is no proof that the wage gap exists,2,NOT
wage gap is fake,2,NOT
can someone explain why this video has a bunch of dislikes i honestly dont understand seemed like a decent factbased video to me did i miss something,1,NOT
is her accent normal im a foreigner so i cant tell but she sounds like a jimmy fallon impersonation of a teenage girl eew i probably misinterpret her intonation the content is very interesting and i find her viewpoint very interesting but i couldnt shake her accent,3,NOT
look it is a dishonest to demand for income equality between men and women women get maternity leaves when theyre pregnant men dont so demanding to get paid for the time you dont work is not nice men are not hesitated to work long hours or even being asked to work long hours women cant work for long hours and they literally need not we live in a capitalist economic country where one earns as much as he works we dont live in a socialistic economy where what you earn is regardless of how much you work equal pay between sexes is not really practical,3,NOT
an other solution ti close the gender pay gab could be by making more and better kindergardens and places you can bring your child when it is sick,1,NOT
the wage gap does exist but its not about women getting paid less its about women choosing jobs that pay less than men do why do women choose lesser paying jobs its not because they need more time to take care of their kids not every woman has a child its because of the way women are raised if you walk into the girls toy section of a store its filled with baby dolls and lots of other toys that are associated with taking care of children and things that are considered feminine other videos about the wage gap will point it out women go into pediactrics over brain surgery all the time im sure theres more but im not aware enough of the job market right now to know if this wasnt a sexist problem then women wouldnt be choosing lesser jobs than men in the first place,1,NOT
the stat that said that women still did the majority of child care despite both parents being in full time jobs my initial thoughts were  how many hours overtime is the man doing  what are the couples professions is one say a receptionist and one is an industrial engineer it was not stated but elsewhere in the vid it shows that woman as a group earn less per year than a man so you can infer that the full time woman is still probably working less hours in a lower paid job than her husband that said both parents should take a more equal role in child rearing than still seems the case today,1,NOT
what wasnt mentioned is that women are generally secondary earners for a family taking parttime jobs only to supplement the couples gross earnings but that would have really pissed off the feminists,2,NOT
the comment section is just as idiotic as you would assume,3,NOT
so since men get more you should treat men bad oh i see now look who became bad pls i just wanna have equal the same,3,NOT
i wonder why people care what gender makes more or less at the end of the day male and females husband and wife bring the money back to the household and spend it together i mean seriously why do you woman think that we men work so hard we work hard to provide for our family and give them a better future if we only thought of ourselves trust me we would work  days a week and party  days,2,NOT
it aint real,2,NOT
ah a video about gender i expect the comment section to be very peaceful full of respect and unbiased,2,NOT
its about averages cant you fools math,3,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,2,NOT
i suspect a slight bias,2,NOT
or men could do cooperate equally with their kids and their house,2,NOT
in order to conclude that the wage gap is a problem you have to start with the presupposition that  the only thing people care about is money and  women have no will of their own and are simply puppets subjected to the world men choose for them,2,NOT
so its not sexism really running out of issues there feminists,2,NOT
this has been completely debunked it is a lie they dont want to go by hourly pay hourly pay the wage gap is insignificant they have banned this question look it up a man works more hours the females want to get paid the same amount for less work this is proven,3,NOT
so womens get to spend time with there kids and make different decisions whats the problem,2,NOT
i have to say im happy to see a middleleft leaning formerly very left leaning outlet like vox talking about what the actual controlled numbers say about the earnings gap instead of just parroting the woefully inadequate statistic women only make  on the dollar to men way to be more objective and take a deeper dive for the truth then many others ive seen,1,NOT
exactly if women can be paid with such a low salary then why not most companies hire women instead of men for certain jobs there are reasons for these wage gaps and its not merely women are seen as being incompetent women are expected by society to dedicate their time for their family while men are expected to feed his family so men can spend more time on their jobs,2,NOT
its illegal to pay someone less because of their gender since ,1,NOT
if they could pay women less just hire all women but they all get paid the same,2,NOT
there will always be inequality there is no utopia,2,NOT
if there was a wage gap we would simply only employ women,2,NOT
you dont get paid for being a parentthe buisness isnt the rd parent in the relationship to thats your own problem,2,NOT
so i lost my mind over this who the hell gets k  year out of business school,2,NOT
this is what milo yiannopoulos ben shapiro and the alt right have been trying to say for like the last  years,1,NOT
yep is the gender winge lie,3,NOT
this was incredibly useful and interesting if we truly want to make a change fully understanding what is going on is the best way to do so good job vox,1,NOT
so your saying if i male go and get a job at mcdonalds and then a female goes and gets the same job that we get payed different i call bullshit,3,NOT
whats that song starting at ,1,NOT
what a surprise a woman complaining about something,5,ABU
youre showing old data though why dont you redo this video with  data maybe then you might actually convince me and many others,2,NOT
if you are using terms like feminazi or fembitch you are missing the whoooole point representation matters words matter you saggy white boys are running around crying because someone called us out on a legacy of privilege why do you feel threatened by a peer trying to get the same cut that you get because you are sexist cry babies,3,NOT
except it really doesnt exist because if a man and a woman both work the exact same job have the same quality of work and the same hours they will get paid the same wage gap would only be a real problem if women were getting paid less for the exact same work thats just discrimination the wage gap only exists because of how they measure wage difference,2,NOT
your conclusions do for logically follow from your argument that there is a wage gap,2,NOT
i cant with the vocal fry i need it to stop i cant take people seriously if they sound like silly bimbos,5,ABU
doesnt exist,2,NOT
if women get paid less then why arent all companies hiring women nowadays,2,NOT
there is no wage gap it is literally illegal to pay women less women make  cents for every dollar a man makes because there are less women working and less women working highpaying jobs statistically women are shown to be less likely to ask for raises than men women have equal rights there is no patriarchy holding you back  of people in america at least believe in equality for everyone go watch a video on the wage gap besides this one its been thoroughly debunked several times feminism is cancer,3,NOT
as long as everyone has the opportunity i dont see any problem,1,NOT
isnt it illegal to pay women less than men ,1,NOT
theres an earnings gap not a wage gap,1,NOT
 is now poor lol ,1,NOT
ahahahahaaaa this is so much fun ahahahaaaa,2,NOT
why do they always point to women doing the majority of child raising like men need to do halve that work to on top of the fact that they never say yes women do most of the child raising and thats because men still pay either though taxeschild support ect the majority of the cost of child raising,2,NOT
the gender pay gap is a myth as proven by the video women desire a more balanved lifestyle more than men men are more likely to work more and harder therefore they get more pay also if your employer is paying you less than a man thats illegal so why dont we see millions of lawsuits every year for discrimination,3,NOT
this also forgets to mention that there are far less women then men to get tech and engineering degrees and that is by choice of the individual women themselves you dont see a ton of men going into nursing because its not what a vast portion of men want to be doing women dominate nursing because a lot more of women value that field of work and lets face it some fields of work are more profitable then others,2,NOT
why do women always try to compare themselves to what men achieve can you go somewhere else and invent your own standardsseriouslyhave your own business methodology no wonder why alot of women feel inferior in a sense dont try to be better than men or earn more than them or have any sort of measurement against them do your own thing be unique,3,NOT
crush the patriarchy like youre crushing that puss,2,NOT
there is no such thing as a gender wage gap that would be highly illegal so stop trying to push the feminist narrative that has be debunked many times over,2,NOT
the fact people who say that the wage gap actually exist disgust me if you are a company all you care about is profit then no men would ever work ever again because all companies would hire women because its less of an expense it is also income not wage income is less because it is proven that women dont work as much as women and does not work as much overtime as men americans all live in a very very privileged life and the fact that you say women are less then men is just an excuse for their failures the fact that men have to pay more for car insurance is that definition of institutional sexism so dont say pink tax is a thing the fact that i have to go to the korean military to regain citizenship and a women doesnt is inequality,3,NOT
people claim that its a myth and demand the statistics to back it up you give them the data and statistics to back it up and suddenly its asinine arguments like oh its really an earnings gap not a wage gap etc semantics im pretty sure we all understand the sentiment here the arguments presented in the video are still sound regardless of what you want to call the issue at hand and then theres the argument see its a lifestyle choice because of work hours it has nothing to do with gender cut the bullshit we all know women have historically been discouraged or forbidden from working in order to rear children and that this is still prevalent in our culture today it is a gender issue one thats so deeply permeated into our culture that people dont even recognize it because they choose to ignore the sociologicalanthropological reasons as to why this is,2,NOT
women take more responsibility for child bearing because they have more of a natural instinct for it this is such feminist bullshit also hate this woman presenting the video annoying voice and pissy attitude poor video vox,6,ABU
recent studies show that the wage gap only equates to  cents to the dollar,1,NOT
are you kidding me id love to make over  keeping this wage gap to only people in college is dumb a lot of people dont have college graduates and would love to make k a year when talking about the wage gap why dont we talk about the wealth gap i cant care about a genderbased wage gap when so many people are in poverty sorry just my two cents,2,NOT
a gender wage gap isnt gender wage gap really,2,NOT
in order to close the gender pay gap make the total earnings of women the same as mens  youd have to stop women from having babies so being that the only set of countries where this lunacy is being pushed is western countries whats being advocated will result in the end of the white race  not to mention laying the precedent for communist equality of outcome society so in short end of the white race and communism  and the mainstream media is pushing this out in the west you should be asking who owns and controls the media and why would they want to bring about the end of the white race and introduce jewish invented communism,5,ABU
well since men earn more doesnt it make since that they keep working while women take care of the kids but also who cares,2,NOT
if we really care about gender equality then why focus only on the wage gap theres an employment gap a workplace fatality gap an education gap a mental health gap and an incarceration gap,2,NOT
i will never understand why this has been so politicized,1,NOT
there is no wage gap for like for like jobs,2,NOT
why does it have to be about gender maybe the men got rewarded for harder work better performance i mean it doesnt have to be about gender just about who does better,3,NOT
scientists have flexible hours are you insane most scientists work their asses off over hours they barely have time to do anything else,2,NOT
so women get paid less because they take care of their children and do more housework and work for less hours for the same job than men ok so feminist myth debunked that for the same amount of time worked women get paid less its quality and quantity that matters to make money so money quality of work x quantity of time given hence even if quality of both genders remains same the quantity of time poured by women is less because of her maternal instincts which should not be booed by feminists i respect good mothers who pour in a lot of efforts in their job as well as to their kids men and women are simply just different if we try to make them look equal or make either gender be superior then its wrong proud egalitarian here ,3,NOT
omfg fix your intonation please preppy college girl accent is not pleasant to listen to,3,NOT
the thing you dont know about the wage gap its fake,3,NOT
men are ten times as likely to be injured or killed on the job that  cents we earn it,5,ABU
so moral of the story if your in business dont have kids,1,NOT
reason for the wage gap women read romance novels men read business books,3,NOT
wow the land of make believe where wage gaps exist,2,NOT
not a bad video but  less of k is not k  min,2,NOT
 triggered feminists,3,NOT
if women were paid less why would anyone hire men,2,NOT
look at who work at fast food restaurants or grocery stores and you see mostly womenthey choose they bullshit ass jobs,5,ABU
equality of opportunity  equality of outcome,1,NOT
why do people hire men at all if they can hire women for the same work and pay them less honest question,2,NOT
it doesnt exist in fact in many jobs females make more,2,NOT
im still not convinced id like to see a study showing how often and how strongly women negotiate higher pay compared to men,2,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap is that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
a great video but there will most likely always be a wage gap because a man who works longer and more often should get payed more than a woman who doesnt and vice versa,2,NOT
the wage gap exists for more than just  reasons jordan peterson speaks about how there are about  factors that contribute to the wage gap potentially some contribute more than others or perhaps not one of the factors is discrimination against women that women activists hate so much despite the factor being a mere  of the issue,2,NOT
the only possible way to kill all wage inequality is by helping to make sharing wages a normal thing,1,NOT
i figured being a vox video that it would have a leftist agenda but was very well balanced nice work great video informative and accurate companies arent actively discriminating its due to biology and biased cultural tendencies to leave women with larger burden of housework leading to them being unable to put as much focus on their careers also id mention men have biological advantage in physically demanding roles which often pay well,1,NOT
soooo glad im not having kids,1,NOT
as a feminist i apologize for the sjws and radfems who turn a blind eye to the truth in favour of some skewered womyn are opreesed bullshit,3,NOT
i think vox finally got something right,2,NOT
children decrease your income and increase your expenses significantly which is why i never understood why some people choose to have them does anyone know the percentage of children who were actually planned for those that were planned what were the reasons such as pressure from parents pressure from spouse etc some people will tell you they dont regret having unplanned kids but theyre just making the best of the situation since they couldve chosen them later or never at all if having children was so great then sex wouldnt need to be so awesome its lifes biggest scam,2,NOT
how can you take what she saying seriously when she cant even state facts correctly not to mention willfully leaving out key parts of the argument when she says men make  and women make  less that means they make  what she meant to say is they make  of what men make at that time which was the  she told us  if she cant understand that what she said is wrong in a heavily funded and scripted show how can we take anything she says seriously how can someone someone mess up presenting facts to people she clearly isnt used to looking at facts and breaking down statistics like educated people do i wouldnt put it past her if she doesnt read statistics because they almost always go against traditional liberal beliefs,5,ABU
does vox know that its illegal to pay a woman less for the same job,2,NOT
disclaimer not trying to start a fight so basically the wage gap is caused by women them selves for their lifestyle so in essence its not a problem that we are facing but a scheduling inconvenience,2,NOT
that video is so stupid,3,NOT
that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
theres also the fact that women on average go to the doctor more often takes more sick days and works less overtime this is not to say anything bad about women they are usually and i dare to say of course on this more likely to be the ones that take care of children and do chores around the house besides if you earn more than k dollars a year before tax then theres nothing to complain about,3,NOT
while this is interesting and recontextualizes things neatly youve gotta wonder why literally all statistics show that women earn less even if its not as big a gap as is usually mentioned we went from  to  is uplifting but its also still  plus all the data you mention talks about women in positions of relative privilege soof course they have it less bad than the average woman does,1,NOT
isnt that an income gap and not a wage gap then,1,NOT
people get paid by their performance look at the nba and the wnba nba makes more because the men are far more entertaining then women because they are more athleticso they can dunk and do flashly moves dont think so you think wnba players are the same as nba players well is there a dunk contest with wnba players nope lets face it in reality men are far more superior then women we are better then women in everyway dissagree with me again well look who won woman of the year in ,6,ABU
this is a better way to look at it,1,NOT
thanks you for being objective but is any of this accounting for how women on average work less hours overall or are less likely to push for longer hours and promotions and what about manual labor any kind of gap would be generated by the fact that there are significantly less women in those fields but im sure findings will reveal that on an hour to hour basis the place to begin that women make exactly as much by the hour seeing as anything other then equal pay is illegal and institutions and organizations exist to enforce that the gap is misrepresenting the stats by the fewer collective hours otherwise the bbb or someone would be stepping in which goes to show you cant fix something that isnt broken if i could fix anything it would be that feminism would be defined as superiority instead of equality since its not about equality its about revenge things were so unequal for so long that now they have to be unequal the otherway instead of balanced like they should,2,NOT
this confirms what ive suspected for ages having children is a massive waste of time  money lol,2,NOT
didnt watch but instant dislike one more feminist video from vox and im unsubbing,3,NOT
so the solution is for women to stop having children,2,NOT
vox didnt say that the wage gap was not down to patriarky which would of been nice to shut up some feminazis,5,ABU
this video didnt acknowledge the large amount of women who do not have kids are are still paid lesser than their male counterparts my seniors who have graduated my law school were paid lesser than the men when offered the associate post maybe its it just about kids,1,NOT
this video was really well explained and informative it shows that the wage gap is real but not for the stereotypical reasons that are being put out,1,NOT
k of dislikes are the crazy femnists who cant handle facts,3,NOT
i really wish that they would have covered the blue collared skilled labour jobs thats a whole different story the gap is huge when it comes to pay and advancement between the sexes,1,NOT
cue the comments against the wage gap despite the video pretty much debunking the generic argument from the left,2,NOT
maybe the wage gap is larger in business fields because the hours tell to be more flexible so women are more likely to take more time off to care for their children and therefore may not be as productive or meet as many quotas as their male or childless counterparts,2,NOT
so theres no discriminationcorrect ,1,NOT
 of people who die at work are men  are women why do feminists never talk about this,2,NOT
it should be equal wages,1,NOT
gotta love it how vox uses ww showreels to exemplify the amount of women used in hard labor jobs when men were less available because they were drafted to fight wars,2,NOT
or women could just be more flexible with their hours like men are,2,NOT
gotta love feminism bashing women who want to stay home and raise their kids its almost like raising people is more important than money or something,3,NOT
a lack of action does not imply a negative action i think the biggest reason people think of the wage gap has some patriarchal influence is their firm belief that everything is a zero sum game they are unable to see that free trade and laws protecting the individual can help both parties without hurting a third party a third party is only hurt in the fact that a transaction may have not been completed individuals should have every right to pay for whatever they want when both parties benefit and nobody loses especially when purchasing or selling labor,3,NOT
theres multiple factors when it comes to wages like different bosses education levels how long you worked there and even what college you went to plays a factor its not your gender that dictates how much pay you get,2,NOT
surprisingly nonsjw for vox,2,NOT
its hard to like listen to you seriously like when you talk with vocal fryyyyyy it sounds like you need a lozenge,3,NOT
theres only two possibilities here women are ignorant of the fact that more demanded skills more hours and more experiencemore pay or they are trying to justify getting something for nothing victim status can be used as a weapon never forget that,5,ABU
i believe this is inaccurate i make just as much as my male and pale counterparts just find a good place,2,NOT
this information doesnt take into an account how men usually work much more hours than women more hours more money,2,NOT
i would argue that modern feminism and equality has made it harder for women,2,NOT
did you count college drop outshigh school drop outsthe difference in job fields when it comes to pay  and ectif you did then you would know that the pay gap isnt caused by sexism but the decisions people make in college and highschool example one kid has a major in art  the other has a major in chemical engineering which would pay more people would say chem engineer but what if the artist was incredibly talented and had good advertising skills than that artist would pay more no matter the gender so if the chem engineer was male and the artist female would you say im wrong  plus what if said artist decided to do commissions by companies and also bid paintings online  so now do you think that the female artist is no richer than some one like steve jobs so through those decisions the artist is rich while the engineer is the average male  but whats the difference  the only difference is the one is talented while the other has no talent nor exceptional education in the field so the only one thats to blame is himself for not picking the most suitable job im thirteen and even i can tell some of what you said was bs ,3,NOT
lol this deserves an unsub im finally free,3,NOT
the only thing im concerned about is what major that high starting out of college,1,NOT
women you want to get paid more do engineering or construction simple dont complain about a wage gap that doesnt exist,3,NOT
flexible hours for everyone ,1,NOT
stop preaching this alt right  bigotry,3,NOT
liz plank isnt going to be happy about this video,2,NOT
hey vox wtf gender gap betwen to genders  i want a gender gap study betwen all  genders ,3,NOT
informative video and all that but listen to it yourself and pay attention to the sound at the end of your sentences once you hear it you cant not focus on it,3,NOT
that theres is none,2,NOT
but these fathers are sacrificing their free time and seeing their family because they are working more to make their family lives better you have to include sick time off overtime,1,NOT
ladies say to me thats not a womens job then i hear thats unfair pay because im a women from them i scratch my head at the contradictions either your a whiner or you truly are crazy,5,ABU
yea what they miss is that people lie vox deliberately lie to them about this nonissue to push their agenda its a hoax,3,NOT
the vocal fry at the end of each of her sentences made this impossible for me to watch with the sound on thanks for the subtitles though,3,NOT
this was surprisingly so much less left agenda than i thought it was going to be this content was pretty neutral cool,2,NOT
but women are in college at higher rates than men,1,NOT
ballshit i work with two girls i have the same hours they get the same money,3,NOT
guys i have an idea what if the wage gap is actually caused by a combination of the phenomenon described in this video the fact that women might be less ambitious on average and a bit of old school sexism,3,NOT
feminist why cant i earn six figures with my masters in womens studies damn patriarchy realists why would i waste so much time and money on a womens studies degree,3,NOT
depends if you consider childrearing damaging to a womans life statisticians concerned with the wage gap will have you believe thats the case,1,NOT
so basically the wage gap is made up and its actually all down to each persons choice as to how much they make and how much effort they are going to put in to finding a job they really want or that pays allot,2,NOT
maybe its because some men work much harder than women of the same profession,3,NOT
this is so much better and more nuanced than that last shitty video vox released on the wage gap,3,NOT
feminists dont factor in job position in job and level of education,3,NOT
you didnt cover different job choices even if you close the average gap within a job there are still differences between types of jobs poor analysis missing such a big factor,3,NOT
it cant be technically correct with all the differences to many facts keep it from being correct thats like saying all men are rapists because of the few men who did commit rape but the gap between the  that never committed that crime and the  that did can be explained while still saying technically all men are still rapists,2,NOT
you bastards got it all wrong you guys are a bunch of feminists looking for something to go on with your agenda you are retarded and the wage gap has been illegal since  you dont take in mind that generally woman work less hours take more days off go to lower paying jobs also men for example have higher times in jail and have a higher suicide rate along with higher deaths at jobs not to mention that a lot of triggered feminists cause men even if the didnt and then ruin there lives in fact woman are probably more privileged then men i could go on for ever to be honest,6,ABU
flexible hours also help with mental health and stress this is a great goal to work towards for everyone,1,NOT
same old argument same old bs same old arrogant person trying to push the fact that there is a gender pay gap which there isnt men get payed more because of the variables if u hired a woman and a man for the exact same job they would get payed the same but men usually work longer later and are less likely to take vacation time,3,NOT
somehow i feel ezra klein chief editor at vox must have been on vacation the week this video got the green light to be posted he would have a fit and cry sexism if he saw this then go back to celebrating the slanderers at the splc and telling sam harris that islam is a religion of peace,3,NOT
please get your head out of your ass,3,NOT
bbbbbbut there are   even five genders triggerednoreason,3,NOT
equality some are more equal than others,2,NOT
its funny how this video disproves the wage gap,1,NOT
simple if someone does a job as well as someone else they get paid the same doesnt need to involve race gender background or religion just how well the job gets done,1,NOT
i understood absolutely nothing in this video d,1,NOT
 k  k bitchy feminist woman that have no husband to complain to because they so bitchy,6,ABU
as any woman working in a science lab will tell you correlation does not prove causation so its nice to say women get paid less because they have babies but not all women have children not all women are the primary caregiver and the wage gap still exists it might factor in but a survey will never ever prove a causal relationship and honestly the wait until youre  when your wages will match and shes just also raising a family are flimsy excuses anyway by the time wages level out later in life the man who was making  more than a woman in the same position will have a much larger savings retirement and pool of assets than the woman so thats bull pucky you shouldnt have to wait until nearly retirement to get paid fairly try again,3,NOT
 is not  less it is  less at least get your math right,2,NOT
pc alert  pc alert ,2,NOT
but  years out of business school things looked really different men were earning an average salary of  while women were earning  less  on average that statement starting at like  is wrong women were earning  of mens salary which is different not to take away from the video just a correction,2,NOT
boy do i miss the wage gap that were the good times,3,NOT
work less paid less,3,NOT
i dont understand why people see the wage gap as feminist lies when as a woman i have always seen it as a call to action to try harder and do more how does that even bother people its a good thing to strive for equality,1,NOT
so basically women like taking care of their kids,2,NOT
i just like that im given facts in this video usually its a young woman calling me a sexist pig lol,2,NOT
men should really take up more of the childs stuff,1,NOT
vox will make a five and a half minute video to sustain a feminist myth its an earnings gap and notice how they never compare people working the same jobs for the same employers yet youll never see a video about how theres only about an  disparity between men and women in being the recipient domestic abuse which is actually likely much less considering men are far less likely to report not to mention many care facilities for domestic abuse victims will turn male victims away simply on the basis of sex then theres also the rate of male rape victims and female theyre extraordinarily close hardly anyone in the media spotlight talks about that certainly not vox or on the subject of work itself how women have two to one odds to men for being chosen for stem fields in the name of equality plus we have built educational programs to encourage women into fields like physics science and math i can tell you with certainty that men do not receive these support systems also most important of all wage discrimination is made constitutionally illegal by the th amendment and reaffirmed by equal rights of the s also maybe this thing called evolutionary biology puts women in the role of primary cause y know theyre the ones popping out the babies if you want to be seen as a credible news organization vox then tell the full story and maintain some ethics in reporting,3,NOT
its a pay gap not a wage gap,2,NOT
men work more hours men make more money mystery solved,2,NOT
like the video but annoying af accent,3,NOT
men are less privileged than women in the us they spend more time in prison for the same crime if charged with rape they will almost definitely be sent to jail guilty or not and if they arent they can be fired from their job for a false accusation if they are divorced they have a high chance of losing custody of children they are expected to do more dangerous jobs and risk their lives in things hardly any women would do in first world countries they are called sexist for just being male and are overall hated by feminazis,5,ABU
you also forgot to add things like working overtime between men and woman,2,NOT
controversial subject reported jk xd,2,NOT
how the care is divided up can be boiled down to instinct men often increase their work hours while women often decrease their hours of work this is something that no amount of social pressure of political activism could ever change this is because there are biological reactions that women have to rearing children even years after theyre born specifically one that happens for most of a childs infancy is lactation breast feeding isnt something you can do and work at the same time even if your work is from home on a computer and its something that only women can do one of the things about the early physical reactions to kids that women have is that they create habits in the time that the mother cant work due to recovering from pregnancy and and a cocktail of chemicals that the brain releases resulting in women not even wanting to be away from their child for  minuets the father assuming that theyre still in the picture has increased his hour of work in an attempt to ensure that the family is well provided for putting his boss in the habit of expecting him to continue to go above and beyond which pretty much locks his situation unless hes willing to loose his job in which event the family would fall apart due to financial struggles so hes not going to risk that and since his hands are tied by the time the mother is capable of entering the work force again she ends up having to take a more lenient job with time at work which often pay less than the jobs where your lack of presence could cost the company money in which case youd be fired so that she can remain on all in case of an emergency with the kids during early child care its not possible to divide up the work evenly and later during child care people are prone to habit and often dont bother trying to fix what isnt broken,2,NOT
if women get paid less then why dont companies hire only women lol,2,NOT
what people who discuss this issue never take into account is the fact that men are generally more aggressive and take higher risks when it comes to finding employment they also are more likely to hold out for higher pay instead of taking a job sooner this vid also doesnt mention the fact that though women in dual income households take more and better care of the children men generally do more of the household manual labor repairs maintenance additions etc yet another incomplete and misleading view of pay gap between genders,3,NOT
you know what i like this video its not just some ignorant feminists saying we earn less because sexism i tend to take arguments in which certain properties of a group of people are the focus rather than their defining qualities here they dont say women earn less because sexism but rather that women earn less because they take different jobs or that women and men in the same field dont make as much because women tend to work less or care more for children  and what not good job vox youre actually educating people,2,NOT
for anyone who wants to save  minutes of there life tldr people make different choices men tent to choose to work more women tent to choose to care for kids more,1,NOT
you never see them mention garbage truck drivers or seweragewater treatment site workers on the lists,1,NOT
so even female pharmacists still make less than their male counter parts,1,NOT
yeah women are better care takers than men i dont get whats wrong with that stupid feminists,3,NOT
not certain why neofeminists feel it is incumbent upon them to lecture the world on the proper division of responsibilities within a relationship there are a myriad of reasons why and how a couple may choose to split their time between work home and family but regardless of the result it remains their decision to render and they typically do so to further the familys advantages not to promote a social agenda if either partner honestly believes they are being taken advantage of it is incumbent upon them to speak with their significant other and attempt to resolve the issue it is not the purview of progressive gender ideologues to resolve those issues for them,2,NOT
you forgot other important factors like work extra hours sickdays vacations different life choices ambitions etc,2,NOT
where i work women tend to want to work less hours and call in more often then men they also complain more about work and usually the manager has to cater to the woman more when it comes to the task at hand its just a number game though i cant say that there isnt women that are more capable then me but when it comes to labor its hands down a mans industry,5,ABU
k people disliked without watching the video assuming it was feminist propaganda,2,NOT
its not real,2,NOT
maddox made a video about the same subject serveral years ago it quiet interesting too warning maddox is quiet straight forward and doesnt care if someone gets offended d,1,NOT
holy sht a first by one of these youtube channels to expose it,1,NOT
you took a survey of men and women who graduated okay did every single man and woman go into the exact and job no they problem with this gap does not bring into the choice that women choose versus men,2,NOT
the stupidity is too high with this wage gap  stop calling it a wage gap because it was never about wages it was about earnings  then add more truth to it and specify median yearly earnings gap that way we can understand what the hell we are actually talking about  then you look at the worked hours per year and you will see the same gap surprise not because it is totally illegal and economically stupid to pay different amounts to different people doing the same work  and in the end you can simplify to median worked hours gap so to summarize the false male hating feminist narrative of wage gap it is in reality a simple median worked hours gap and we can all go to rest knowing that men work more therefore earn more and we can also focus on what is important if we actually care about the gap to allow women work more hours but because we all know that feminists and libtards never ever cared about the real issue and they are all in for male bashing they will continue to use the debunked false wage gap narrative i can bet you  that  years from now i will open a leftist feminist website and i will read another stupid male hating gender wage gap article that paints all women as victims and all men as predators because why the hell not,5,ABU
if you confine your research to married working couples then why should the wage gap even matter at all the household is going to benefit if one party is being paid more regardless of who that party happens to be,2,NOT
the gender wage gap pales in comparison to the wage gap for workers with disabilities workers with disabilities earn for every dollar their nondisabled colleagues make  so yeah the gender wage gap sucks but the disability wage gap is a travesty,1,NOT
i didnt make any kids not my problem wierd graphs,1,NOT
vox please state the actual gender gap you dont mention it at all its about  its rather small almost insignificant,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
i was like wait a second is vox actually gonna put good information finally then i watched it and realized nahhh still trying to push some agenda,2,NOT
wait  years out of business school men have an average salary of  dollars average how is this real please tell me it isnt,1,NOT
maybe female scientists have less children,1,NOT
who even cares about this subject besides uninformed women,5,ABU
the wage gap is a myth me and women take other jobs voluntarily women take maternity leave off voluntarily you could just get a babysitter or have your partener take time off or just not have a child remember they made the choice to have kids women made the choice to do child work,3,NOT
sowhat gavin mcinnes said about women choosing to earn less was agreed upon by vox wild,1,NOT
why would you want to close the wage gap if you dont know the conditions that produce it thats like wanting to close the wage gap between ceos and their gardeners making people more similar for similaritys sake is just pointless,3,NOT
 no its not thanks for the video bye,3,NOT
vox for ideologues that cant accept reality,3,NOT
in my country women are paid way more than men in basic salary add other benefits like extra allowances less working hours better work life balance etc etc and women are paid more than double of what men are paid with the same qualifications and skills ,2,NOT
soooo the feminists we wrong saying that the wage gap was caused by the sexist patriarchy,2,NOT
there were some lightly misleadingly used statistics in here but i like the overall message so gave it a like,2,NOT
women usually go into lower paying jobs thats why there is a wage gap,2,NOT
the statistic you start out with covers all jobs not just harvardtype office jobs please include the jobs that are more physically demanding dangerous it healthimpacting because those are also in the original statistic and are done mostly by men men will do these jobs because a they pay more and b they are trying to support the women in their lives truck driving construction mining firefighting policing mechanic jobs and so on may have some representation by women but it tends to be small women tend to want the safe clean office jobs but who built the office buildings and got paid well for doing the rougher job in the end black lung disease is a male disease and men make up for a disproportionate share of workplace fatalities because they are trying to earn good money for their families and then they get dinged for earning more how heartless can you get,2,NOT
say no to equality of outcome kids equality of outcome is bad mkay,2,NOT
no mention of women outearning men in their s no mention of women graduating from university at a ridiculously higher rate than men while men on average are more likely to go into a trade and become a plumberpainterbuildermechanic etc men virtually run the labor force but thats ok we dont want those stinky jobs we want to be ceos and scientists men are  of garbage collectors not a problem we dont want to collect garbage,3,NOT
they arr only women no importance in life,6,ABU
i had a teacher in high school help explain this to me she had two children for both children she of course had to take time off of work and while her and her husband are both teachers with their doctorates in education when they retire he will end up having earned more money then her why is that because for each child she had to take roughly a year off work having her salary cut in half while her husband continued to work a big issue mentioned in this video is that women are still responsible for most of the household duties even with full time jobs ever hear of a father on paternity leave if the responsibilities were more equal maybe the pay gap would decrease yes in most jobs men and women will get paid the same amount of money if not there would be an even bigger uproar about this inequality its the longterm issues that the pay gap is about imagine having to try to divide or attention and priorities between work and your children evenly while your gender counterparts dont have this issuethey can automatically place their attention on work giving them a leg up in the workplace raising a child is a team effort and what kind of team mate leaves you with all the heavy lifting just to claim the gold medal not saying this is the case for every family but the statistics say its the case for a lot,1,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap there is none,2,NOT
dont call it a gender wage gap to mislead people just call it different life choices earnings gap,2,NOT
so the soulution is to force women to work in profession that they dont want just too have the same pay yay great soulution by feminists taking awaya women right to choose her job,3,NOT
this does not account for the fact that it is more likely that men work overtime and therefore deserve a promotion in jobs and pay,2,NOT
also fun fact the wage gap is a lie men often take more high paying jobs since we look more towards science and mecanica but women look more to serving and receptions just to call a few examples,2,NOT
in the us its been illegal since the s to pay unequally for the same job,1,NOT
so the wage gap is true in certain cases but not to extent weve been told,1,NOT
the video confused me a bit so does the gender gap exist or not what i took away from the video is that the average woman earns less than the average man because she works less hours if so then logic dictates that the gap doesnt exist its just statistics that lean towards mens favour,1,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women it does not take into account different job positions or education levels,1,NOT
wow an honest look into the wage gap,1,NOT
like  of these hurr durr y not just hire women den edge lords didnt even watch the video lmao,2,NOT
anyone gonna question what job pays k right off the bat and increase to half a million in  years,1,NOT
why have we not shifted our focus after all these decades considreing what has happened women have become less happy and we have too few children to sustain ourselves we need to widen the wage gap not close it we need more kids more mothers tending to their children family is more important than wasting away in a cubicle more important for women and more important for our society overall a fairly respectable video but as is standard with vox the presentation seemingly made for  year olds was revolting as always,5,ABU
why do they have to eat around the bush why cant they just say it is due to flexbility of the hours they kepts getting me lost,2,NOT
why do we need to close the earnings gap ,3,NOT
two thumbs up for telling the truth on youtube not an easy thing to do nowadays ,1,NOT
give men equal parental rights maybe this would help but wont fit the feminist agenda,3,NOT
 this video specifically asserts that there is not a a wage discrepancy due to sexism or anything like that  this video attributes the cause of what wage discrepancy to the different occupations women choose to take  this video recognizes that women are more likely to raise children and does not suggest that this should change  this video acknowledges that as jobs become more flexible child care becomes less of a conflict and thus narrows the otherwise natural gap  this video does not suggest that anything needs to be done other than maybe encourage possibilities that make occupations more versatile they dont argue that any sexism exists in the first place to fix but merely that the wage gap will disappear as jobs become more flexible come on people if you want to argue against the ignorance spouted about how sexist the world is make sure that youre actually targeting the right things if anything this video attacks the fallacy of the  cents figure,1,NOT
the wage gap does not exist vox get real,2,NOT
feminists getting triggered,3,NOT
damn poor women making k,2,NOT
im gonna show this video to whatever girl peeping about men earning more,3,NOT
easy dont have babies,2,NOT
refreshing to see a logical explanation behind the numbers instead of the usual screeching of people getting way too emotional over these subjects,1,NOT
wow a fair video from vox this did not cover it all but it was honest earnings gape not wage gap,1,NOT
the heartbreak tour must have been a flop,1,NOT

hi freelee i have been vegetarian since i was eleven years old always with a keen disinterest in the taste of meat i recently decided i would go vegan and began exclusively eating a plant based diet but despite feeling good i found i was losing too much weight i wasnt big to begin with so the weight loss was dramatic ive turned back to dairy and eggs as a dense calorie source but id like to continue the transitionthough unsure how to expand my stomach enough to accommodate the volume of fruits and veg required to maintain a healthy weight i hoped you could address this in a future video also i struggle slightly with the idea of consuming as many calories as an obese person or person eating for two and not with the fear of gaining weight but with the knowledge that our planet has limited resources and in  billion if half of us are eating for two wouldnt that seem closer to  and a deeper strain on the enviroment any thought you have on this topic would be great thank you ,1,NOT

honestly i think you and trish are very similar you both have strong personalities but inside youre both sweet and both are going through relationship troubles i think you two should give friendship another go and help eachother through this and you can help trish with her vegan transformation and she can help you with collabs she has so many subs and so do you but she could have a bigger voice for the vegan community i see a friendship blossoming already,1,NOT
im so proud of you girls,1,NOT

i just balled my eyes out watching that short clip about animal harm i think its time to start reevaluating on what i eat,1,NOT
what happened to your instagram i cant find it and the link in your description doesnt work either ,1,NOT
i really wanna go vegan but ive recovered from an eating disorder im finally feeling comfortable with my current weight and ive heard alot of people say that you gain weight to start and even the idea of that gives me so much anxiety  i know its silly considering the end result and the ethics or maybe you dont gain weight i dont know  any advicetips expereinces for me friends,1,NOT
trish posted on snapchat and instagram that she was eating chicken and waffles guess her vegan diet didnt last long,1,NOT
she was eating chicken on her snapchat story today i had such high hopes  im so disappointed dont get me wrong i love trisha but i was kinda hoping shed actually at least do the whole  weeks,1,NOT
ive been vegan for almost a month and i have never felt more physically and mentally healthier i used to always go off and on with a vegetarian diet but freelee was the final push i needed cowspiracy will turn anyone who watches it into a vegan its seriously eyeopening ,1,NOT
love love love love love ,1,NOT
wow i love how people hate on freelee and say shes a horrible person but what shes doing is working so many people have become vegan because of freelee these people are becoming happier and healthier thank you freelee,1,NOT
we all new this vid was going to come,1,NOT
i hear trisha ate nonvegan pizza just today anyone following her on snapchat,1,NOT
please dont get too excited because this isnt going to last,2,NOT
it doesnt matter whether or not shes trolling or if shell stick with it  if we treat her kindly with respect and thoughtful support if we help educate her and encourage her not only will trish be more likely to really stick with the plant based diet and hopefully cut out animal consumption in other areas of her life but it helps spread the message to all of her audience so her followers can see that vegans arent crazy pushy freaks but are actually just concerned people who want to help animals that could help a lot more people go vegan than just attacking trish for oh shes just trolling oh she cant do it lets remember to extend our compassion to everyone,1,NOT
when she first uploaded this i thought it was a joke her trolling so i didnt watch it was on a news page today and this video came up and they wrote about it so i was like hol up she was serious so i had to come back and watch this and this is just absurd i dont even know what to say lmaaaaooo,1,NOT
my brain just imploded ,1,NOT
freelee i need your help i grew up on animal products living in oklahoma usa always having barbecues going to get fast food never doing anything but playing video games and going to school all of my friends are horrible influences and none of them are vegan much less eat like you do im a vegan but since im only  i cant drain the low income of my single dad family with raw food prices so im gonna have to wait until im  in   years and id love to get to meet you and have you as my health mentor i love your channel and the message you project much love from america,1,NOT
gurl  bye  i cant  trisha baby girl pls we all know you are trolling and its getting out of control because its starting to get offensive,2,NOT
im lesbian but cant be with a woman sexually  trisha and now trans  girl stop lol,1,NOT
wanting to swap from looking like a male or female does not make you trans,1,NOT
tbh i dont like trans and im an asshole yea but i really dislike shit like this,5,ABU
okay you need to stop because there are actually people who watch you that are transgender nonbinary and genderfluid you should educate yourself by getting friends that have gone throught the bs that family members that dont accept them people lose their lives every day because of this educate before talking about this crap,2,NOT
and gay men dont get fucking sex changes so here is a lesson trish gay men date gay men they keep their parts and stay as male lesbians are women who date women drag queens are men who dress up in womens clothing transvestites are men who like wearing womens clothing with no goal to become a woman transgender male to female and female to male we are individuals who have body dysphoria our bodies dont match our brain state we hate having the parts we were born with and fight to become the the gender which will align with ur mind heart and soul we are the ones who get sex changes bisexuals are men or women who will date both sexes hope this helped we dont do it for attention we dont do it to get onto tv or put in magazines and we certainly dont use it to get views,1,NOT
congrats for coming out as cis trisha were so proud of you,1,NOT
 starting to sound like she heard the man by taylor swift and was like video idea,1,NOT
this is funny,1,NOT
honestly ive always gotten male vibes from you so i hope this is true and not clickbait,1,NOT
the clownery luv xx,2,NOT
sis delete this video,3,NOT
straight guys turn me off she says as she sucks  and demands to be fucked x a day,5,ABU
being transgender isnt about who youre attracted to its about who you are ,1,NOT
uhm are you okay,1,NOT
im not attracted to straight guysi like guy guys therefor will think im a boy hunny so do i why do you think all the woman say why are the gay guys so hotxx but seriously if this is true then im happy for you but i dont know if anyone believes itxx,1,NOT
baby girl youre queer period,1,NOT
my brain while watching this ,1,NOT
let me get this straight im not she wants to go through the entire process to become a male just so she can dress up as a female im not hating or anything im just very confused on her thought process,1,NOT
accidently a biting satire of a infectious  memetic  gender identity delusions ,1,NOT
ive never been so confused in my life,1,NOT
ok so what i got from this is that she just wants a shorter haircut because she doesnt like brushing her hair,1,NOT
i now what shes coming from i have always wanted to be a girl and i thought i was born someone else in a different body i am not that happy of being a boy and going through what guys have to go through but i also dont want to go through the process of being trans i am gay i love being feminine if i could choose anytime i wanted to i would change to a girl without having to go through a different process i love you trisha there are a lot of haters in the comments but you keep being you and never stop being yourself ,1,NOT
love love love your hair ,1,NOT
i came here because someone has a petition to have her looks and sounds like a her removed from yt because she is offensive whether i agree with her or not i defend her right to say what she wants without being censored dont like it change the channel and now i will go watch something else,1,NOT
this bitch really used her zac efron in the thumbnail lmao ahhhhhhh,3,NOT
you need to think about this some more before you come out im thinking through shit too but im not coming out until im sure,1,NOT
trisha is just being himself leave him alone i love you trisha ,1,NOT
trish actually shut the fuck up im sorry but im calling bullshit,2,NOT
ahhhhhh trishanooooo idk how to feel about this anymore i think you need a sit down with someone who knows more about this and figure yourself out off camera this is a really serious thing that i wish you left off the internet and figured it all out on your own first with a professional come on,1,NOT
so is she trying to say shes gender fluid and likes drag ,1,NOT
remember when you said you were a lesbian,1,NOT
i dont like to be the center of attention proceeds to try to be the center of attention,1,NOT
you poor stupid bitch hungry for attention is a bad look on anyone,6,ABU
trish hun are you okay like genuinely its okay if youre not but nothing about this makes sense,1,NOT
thank you gigi gorgeous for clearing that up im totally not confuse hugs,1,NOT
ive always been attracted to gay guys  so maybe im a gay man  ive lost brain cells watching this video,1,NOT
youre fucking sick in the head educate yourself before making such an ignorant video get help,5,ABU
have you explored nonbinary or bigender as a better label for your gender gender is very individual and there might not be an exact label for your identity but those might better encompass what you have said in this video,1,NOT
girl shut the fuck up,3,NOT
this video pisses me off to the core not once have you mentioned real gender dysphoria in my eyes you need dysphoria to be trans i hang out with mostly boys too that doesnt make me trans you seriously are making the trans community who go through hell everyday look bad shut the fuck up fr,3,NOT
ok this video blows my mind not because trish is nuts and we all know that but because of all the hate comments so according to some of you only someone who looks the way you think they should can claim to be transgender way to be accepting,1,NOT
how long before this starts a ton of shit in the lgb community,1,NOT
does she know what non binary means because the whole time she keeps saying how she sometimes likes being feminine and masculine but then calls herself transgender and a gay man  wth is going on,1,NOT
its really sad that shes doing this with the assumption that is all accepting yet most of the comment and dislike are from people inof support of the community she wants to be a part of,1,NOT
what the fuck is this video,2,NOT
 ignore this im gonna make a remix,1,NOT
should have stuck to eating food videos  this is it for me,1,NOT
i need kalvin garrahs opinionthoughts and insights on this lol,1,NOT
im cis and even i know what ur describing is wanting to be masculine not feeling the need to be a man,1,NOT
trish its so much easier to be a man therefore because i feel free from social standards as a man i am one,1,NOT
im very much about bbs and i love showing them off im sorry no trans man would ever say that i know tons of fem trans guys but none of them would use that word to talk about their chest i used to love trish but this is wild love you review sex toys in lingerie but the fact that you talk about all of the ftm partners you have had makes it sound like its just sexualized to you or a fetish this is seriously going to do more damage to the trans community than jonathan yaniv the you can be whatever gender you want comment especially pissed me off because that makes trans seem like a choice nobody would choose that i dont want anyone thinking that i think this because she is feminine but the fact that she always has her chest out and id very confident about her body body positivity is awesome but no trans man would do that okay this rant is over im sorry it was all over the place though nobody is gonna read this far lol,2,NOT
no one asked for this video ,1,NOT
i feel like everyone is hating on him because they dont know how he feels i personally have always felt like this its  and we should except him for who he is leave him alone and let trish be who he is ,1,NOT
um whos gonna tell her,1,NOT
here comes the tea videos,1,NOT
wow long time not see you i came just for your new drama attention hahahahha and all i can say you look skinny,2,NOT
i think yall b forgettin that shes a troll,1,NOT
what was not expecting this video at all,1,NOT
i cant be the only one who understood im trash,1,NOT
w h a t ,1,NOT
craziest thing ive ever heard,1,NOT
trisha maybe youre just a tomboy i mean i am a girl and i like more fem guys but theyre feminine straight guys in the world i think youre confused really confused this is really offensive to trans people,2,NOT
trisha no delete this,2,NOT
is anyone else sooo confused on what she is talking about and thinks shes fucking crazy,5,ABU
first of all gay people or binary whatever the hell you people want to call yourselves yall arent the only ones in the world with the right to free speech so you can get down off your high horses you dont want anyone judging you yet you judge everyone else just a bunch of spineless pussies,5,ABU
youve gone too far now trisha youve completely lost my respect dude im sorry but this is just so fkn disrespectful,2,NOT
get this girl some lithium asap,2,NOT
this is so fucking toxic and harmful for actual trans individuals stop claiming to be a part of communities because youre bored that week jfc,1,NOT
whos gon tell ha ,1,NOT
i am confused ,1,NOT
oh my god shut up,1,NOT
by saying that she identifies as female one day and male the next is she trying to say shes genderfluid,1,NOT
you have boobs and a vagina im pretty sure your a girl and not a transgender gay man  like   brain cell,2,NOT
borderline personality causes serious identity issues not saying she has is but if you look at the cycles it makes sense,1,NOT
james charles version im attracted to straight guys so that makes me a straight female,1,NOT
im sorry but this whole vid smells like bullshit trish,2,NOT
the literal definition of dilusional and uneducated in human form ,3,NOT
this entire video can be summed up by trisha saying shes genderfluid,1,NOT
wasnt she a lesbian like a year ago,1,NOT
i honestly hate that i have her money by watching this video but i had to see this train wreck,1,NOT
are you okay,1,NOT
honestly if she is doing this for clout im suing if she is gender queer i understand how confusing it is and why she had a hard time explaining this but if she is just saying it bc she is irrelevant or wants to sound woke imma be pissed,2,NOT
didnt she make a song that she loves jesus,1,NOT
 gender fluid,1,NOT
shes confusing her dislike for the way men treat see her when she is feminine and her needing to change her gender,1,NOT
ah stk dizzlikes,1,NOT
is she ok ,1,NOT
my only problem is that you say youre trans for all the wrong reasons gender is not a choice i did not decide to be transgender but i am wanting short hair because its easier to deal with does not make you trans having a fetish for gay men does not make you trans wearing sports bras does not make you trans having gender dysphoria however does make you trans feeling overwhelming discomfort and wrongness when people call you she or a girl does make you trans if youd said something along those lines i feel like this whole thing would have gone very differently i want to support you i really really do but youre making it very difficult,1,NOT
i dont wanna identify as they because people will think im schizophrenic wtf,2,NOT
wow you are the biggest piece of shit you are doing this for views to get a paycheck there are people who are actually dealing with these issues and concerns that you are pretty much disregarding your a horrible person,5,ABU
trisha paytas hmm having short hair this one time was nice gender confirmation surgery,1,NOT
can we stop blurring all the lines so damn much people just need to be proud of who they are,1,NOT
bruh are u ok,1,NOT
maybe check out genderfluid,1,NOT
she says got the parts as if shes trying to fucking fix her car,1,NOT
people cant take a joke ruunnn alphabet community is coming for u,1,NOT
youre literally part of the reason why cis people see us as a joke,1,NOT
i cant take you seriously anymore seriously,1,NOT
i feel so ashamed being transgenderbecause of this,1,NOT
oh no i hope they dont make any permanent decisions because this is probably a identity crisis,1,NOT
if you dont feel like a female why did you have your boobs done why do you post these sexual pictures about yourself in lingerie why do you just look and act like a  female trisha this doesnt make sense girl wtf,1,NOT
does anyone understand what shes talking about cause i sure dont ,1,NOT
normally id joke about losing brain cells but this time i actually did,1,NOT
trishasweetie imma head out,1,NOT
i think shes utterly envious of jeffree  shane  the attention theyre getting,2,NOT
ive wondered for a while if trisha has undiagnosed did it would explain so much of her behavior,2,NOT
i love being in the lgbtq community lgbtq communitywho let her innobodydid she sneak in again,2,NOT
become the person u wanna be,1,NOT
with this logic were basically all fuckin transgender this is just stupid the more n more she talks i think she really really truly does want b jeffree star just stop we see u,3,NOT
i wanna buy what shes smoking jkjkjk,1,NOT
just bc youre attracted to gay guys doesnt make you a gay man what,1,NOT

what is on her forehead,1,NOT
there are more dislikes than likes,1,NOT
you are stupid,5,ABU
the fact that this person is trying to explain why they identify as a man is what makes me think they might actually be confusing the fact that they like things that are not stereotypically liked by women with identifying as a man if you are trans it is because you are born that way and it does not have anything to do with your likings manners etc,1,NOT
do i think im transgender  do i identify with my born pronouns  hunny you cant be both  you can use they them pronouns and be non binary but you cant be hehimhissheher hers its not how it works ,1,NOT

i cant figure you out tbh,2,NOT
hey freelee dont know if you watched shanes new rainbow taco vid but he used the quorn vegetarian mince i was squealing with excitement haha you should watch,1,NOT
too bad trish is impressionable and actually believes you are thin because of your vegan diet you have falsely led her to believe she can stuff herself with pasta and carbs as much as she wants she just doesnt realize youre a bulimic currently with a huge eating disorder and if you think you are fooling us all out here think again i see the signs youve got atrophy of all your muscles anorexic  bulimic we know you throw up your food after your big restaurant meals its just wrong what you do youre a bully and an awful person just because trish was nice does not mean that youre good you suck in every way possible and you are hurting more people than you help,5,ABU
shes explained why and when shes starting and wtf you guys this is a big fucking step go trish and way to go freelee for being an unexpected friend to her,2,NOT

hi freelee ive been watching through a lot of your videos recently and you have been such an inspiration that i really think i wanna go vegan in the near future luckily im moving back onto campus in  weeks where ill have access to a full kitchen and away from my large family that i live with who makes having a different eating lifestyle a difficult task but my main concern is will i be able to make sure my body is getting what it needs i have problems with my appetite and rarely feel hungry the act or even just the thought of eating most of the time makes me nausous and dizzy its extremely unhealthy i know and i wanna work towards fixing it have you encountered anyone who had this problem what kind of tips can you recommend on ways to make sure ill be eating enough to live heathily on a vegan lifestyle it would mean the world to me if you could point me in the right direction or if anyone else has any words of wisdom,1,NOT
vegan woop woop i am glad that she is making the change thats awesome,1,NOT
so can anybody recommend any vegan baking videos or recipes or even books  ive been a veggie for  years now since i was  but more recently i have been cutting out dairy products too and changed all my beauty products and all that stuff to natural cruelty free items i think that means im slowly converting i miss baking and could do with some yummy recipes to try cakes biscuits etc also i much prefer videos like these i find the swearing and stuff hard to watch i understand its coming from a place of passion but its nicer to hear much more positivity and encouraging words ,1,NOT
vegans dont do anything animals still get killed and just because they are not eating meat doesnt mean that animals are safe now,2,NOT
so many you tubers are going vegan it makes me so happy ,1,NOT
ive been vegetarian for almost  years now and i would love to see a video on what your go to foods are in a day i want to go vegan but i havent educated myself enough on what to substitute so i am looking forward to that video you do look amazing and im sure you feel even better ,1,NOT
am happy for her finally ,1,NOT
hi freelee i wanted to thank you and trisha for giving me the motivation to start my new lifestyle i am currently a vegetarian as i knew if i went straight to veganism then i wouldnt enjoy it and i would give up so i am starting vegeterianism and hope soon to convert to having a full vegan lifestyle i have thought about it ever since i discovered your channel at first i hated you and i didnt listen to the points you made but now i fully support the vegan community the thing that really motivated me was if trisha can be vegan then i can too thank you so much,2,NOT

im exactly the same with freelee with the fact of animal slaughter,1,NOT
watermelon squats baby,1,NOT
to the comments about this being old footage it honestly doesnt matter whether or not she has eaten animals since this doesnt matter because the journey to veganism is not easy for most people trisha may relapse multiple times what matters is that she is making the effort towards being vegan its important that she keeps going back to it and getting educated so that she can figure out what works best for her and eventually get to the place she wants to be if youre vegan yourself think about how hard it truly was to transition probably you had to make many enormous life changes so you could become vegan trisha is just really starting this journey finally realizing how veganism is a good thing and she should let it into her life cut her some slack this is an opportunity for education not for belittlement if you dont welcome her into the community she wont want to or have the resources to stay,1,NOT
you and i definitely have the same views when it comes to animals i cry every time i see one of those videos because theyre so innocent and have no voice i hate it ,1,NOT

hmmm this woman is going on a diet because she is under pressure to look a certain way for music videos shes only eating fruit because she thinks it will help her having to look a certain way for the music media bosses she isnt doing it to be healthy shes doing it to be exploited and promote eating disorders its sad to see girls under so much pressure to be skinny this is not an advert for veganism an advert for veganism is to eat for health concern and even for an ideology to promote tolerance and peace not to eat to be exploited and forced to look borderline anorexic shame be well trisha,3,NOT
does anyone remember what the name of the video was the one freelee showed on snap chat,1,NOT

mel joy also went vegan,1,NOT
trish please go see a gender therapist if you actually feel this way you still seem very confused about your identity so i think it would be a good thing for you to see if you are transgender nonbinary with the help of a professional that really understands the topic,2,NOT

sis this is so ugly just when i thought you couldnt get any worse you have trans friends how could you make a joke of it youre fucked,5,ABU
sounds like someone doesnt understand gender,3,NOT
youre not transgender youre just careless about your looks its called lazy ass you just dont want the troubles of brushing your hair and putting on makeup everyday  attention seeker alert ,5,ABU
most every thing she said she felt is how i am but to me im like a bisexual tomboy she is full of it,5,ABU
i wish more people were like this and understood that they are everything and everyone all at once we are one,2,NOT
do us a favor trysha and blast that pathetic excuse of a face with a good old shotgun how can someone be atracted to that wall paint covered plastic bowl,5,ABU
lmfaooo was jason gay ,5,ABU
sorry but i think you just are jealous of how males are in society like you are jealous that men can be assertive and not be a bitch you are jealous that you dont need makeup or hair done and it not be frowned upon you dont want to be hit on by weird guys like most people dont want that this doesnt mean you are trans you just like the idea of being a guy cus they are treated better in society idk but i think thats how ur felling,3,NOT
i really hope you get the proffessional help you so obviously need,5,ABU
it sounds more like your genderfluid not trans  but you do you ,3,NOT
also this is further insensitive as fuck considering its the anniversary of matthew shepard being brutally murdered for being gay maybe you should keep your mouth shut about things you lnow are going to piss people off for a few days before blurting them out sit on them  think a bit before you gung ho it hurt peoples feelings and then in a few days time change your mind theres a humongous difference between being a fun loving troll and a hurtful piece of shit ,5,ABU
i would definitely say you are confused you should do more research before you make a video like this,3,NOT
im trans ftm im not offended just concerned that she isnt  educated i dont know this video is so much i wanna cry  laugh but i want to talk to her trisha please talk to me idk i need to talk to you i wish i could have a conversation with her about this,2,NOT
i understand that theres a lot of day to day pressure of being a woman that many of us wish didnt exist but i dont feel like that makes you trans but i mean as long as youre happy im not one to talk,3,NOT
i just had to make sure i hit thumbs down,2,NOT
i understand you fully keep doing you girl,1,NOT
im totally fine with the fact that you may be questioning your gender identity its a very confusing thing but this video is very messy and you dont have any idea what youre talking about please do some research and maybe go to a gender therapist if you truly do believe youre trans dont just say that you are,3,NOT
good for you no matter how you dress or act its how you feel inside,2,NOT
you absolute fool youre not trans,5,ABU
i honestly hope shes being serious bc otherwise this can be rly problematic,2,NOT
shes gonna be a detransitioner i stg,2,NOT

this video makes me ashamed to be trans gtfo trisha you toxic asf,5,ABU
so jasons gay,2,NOT
this is so ridiculous i cant understand your mindset in constantly doing stupid things for publicity get over yourself for real,5,ABU
do i identify as a transgender man  do i identify as my natural born gender  these are the  most stupid and utterly ridiculous sentences i have ever heard come out of someones mouth,5,ABU

we have female parts ttherefore we must be bitches too thanks for clarifying ,3,NOT
i get you want attention but uhhhthis aint the way to do it sis,2,NOT
what the actual fck like what thethis is so offensive its fucking offensive you say youre not trying to be offensive but you are i am trying to understand you but you need to see a professional counselor being trans isnt a choice if it was a choice i would choose to be cis i would choose to be normal i hate being an outlier i hate feeling like i dont fit anywhere i hate sometimes thinking how much better it would be if i just wasnt here anymore because i hate being the way i am do i have pride yes but shit like this is a huge slap in the face how dare you trish t whatever name you prefer us to call you how dare you,5,ABU
wonder what gigi will think of this,1,NOT
im glad this was demonitised,2,NOT
i find this video really offensive,2,NOT
omg god that videos is weird ,2,NOT
this irritates me,2,NOT
at first i was really annoyed and she didnt make sense but when she talked about when she did her hair like a boy she felt free and happy i honestly im happy for you do you boo,1,NOT
you you have no idea what being trans is do you,2,NOT
honey what the fuck,3,NOT
how can a woman who was born a woman think to identify as a male or is a female that because she relates more with males identifies as a male i enjoy some of your videos but this is one that no offense confuses the living shit out of me for the life of me i cannot understand how or why you think your transgender and this video does not explain your thoughts very well at all you cannot be a transgender male and a natural born female that identifies as her natural self its just not how it works,3,NOT
ok real life question but i guess i need some help to understand cant you not be transgender if your a female wanting to be a female but a gay man at the same time isnt that the most like  level of offense like you cannot be trans if you are already the gender you want to be its one thing if she would like to be a man i feel like we would all be supportive but now im so confused like she wants to be transgender as a man but a woman can someone please help me understand honestly i do not want to offend or even judge her i just dont get it,2,NOT
do i identify as a transgender man  do i identify as my natural born gender  how the in the name is sweet baby jesus does this make any sense these two sentences are they dumbest words ive ever heard come out of a humans mouth  ive heard a lot of dumb things,5,ABU
she probably should have really thought this through before posting this video for the world to see being a part of the lgbtq  community i dont think she tried to offend the community but this isnt a well thought out decision personally i feel she should explore herself more and acclimate herself to the proper terminology,3,NOT
jasons dick must of been that trash made her turn transgender,5,ABU
its nonbinary for u,3,NOT
youre confusing transgender with mental instability for the love of god go get some therapy the last thing you wanna do is be your usual insincere trisha paytas self with the lgbtq community cause this video is actually offensive,5,ABU
idk if theres anything trisha could do to make me dislike her haha ,2,NOT
i have always had penis envy because i think my life would be easier if i had that part bless her heart,2,NOT
i think she means she identifies as gender fluid and pansexual,2,NOT
i cant even never seen a person more starving for attention and money that this broad ,5,ABU
annndddd the top line of the description is for tickets to something lol as if,2,NOT
sooooo what are your pronouns then im so confused lol someone explain this to me also what did trish mean when she said you can be everything all at once like im pretty sure you cant be lesbian gay bi trans nb ace and everything else all at once,2,NOT
mum this is not a phase i am ronald mcdonald,2,NOT
shes clearly just genderfluid and isnt familiar with what that jank means,3,NOT
as a gay man i dont find this offensive i just see a person explaining how they feel and just trying to figure out their identity as a person,2,NOT
this video is peak   no s sums it all up person in the future looks up s in an encyclopedia encyclopedia links to this video,2,NOT
why does she record on the kitchen floor,1,NOT
im confused becuase usually with transgenders if they wanna be the opposite gender they start off like that at an early age for example if you let a man your going to be very feminine and girly and if your a girl you will be very masculine and manly,2,NOT
you are maybe the most unintelligent person i know of,5,ABU
this isnt cool at all im not the type of guy to attack people because as someone who is ftm with dysphoria but also likes makeup and stuff ive been called a trans trender and all that but first of all just because you think life would be easier as a guy doesnt mean you are a guy and being attracted to more feminine men does not mean youre a gay man its just preference this really just hurts to watch because you used to be one of my favorite people but this video deeply hurts me,2,NOT
oh god im cringing so hard,3,NOT
she said i dont like to be the center of attention except when i like to be the center of attention wtf  i think i lost at least a dozen brain cells watching this video,5,ABU

i believe that you are gender fluid or still confused,2,NOT
cant finish this video clearly unaddressed trauma and other mental issues have finally taken its toll,5,ABU
i feel like she is so mixed up about terms and what it means to be transgender she just wants to be casual and seen as a person rather than a sex object which is how she associates women probably because most of the time thats her experience and thats not something anyone should have to just accept and like thats totally valid but that doesnt necessarily mean that shes a man being comfortable not wearing makeup in your day to day life and being super low maintenance except when you want attention is not a trait specific to men thats how a lot of cis women are too not wanting attention from random straight men is not a trait specific to men having short hair as a woman doesnt make you trans i have a boys haircut but im a female it seems like much of her reasoning is just based off of bias of how women and men and gay men and straight men are supposed to be or usually are instead of grouping all straight men in with toxic masculinity and misogyny we need to recognize that any man can be feminine if he wants and of course all men should respect women of course i know its mostly straight men who dont and who sexualize women and all this but its not exclusive to straight men either also her comment about having penis envy is another reason i think shes just mixed up she equates men with power and having a penis with the way shes percieved she is a woman but the trauma shes experienced from being a woman especially a very outwardly sexual woman in todays society has caused her to have extreme biases towards what certain genders mean im not blaming her this is mostly indicative of a larger problem in todays society but i feel bad for her that she thinks she has to come to terms with being transgender in order to just live comfortably and dress how she wants very concerned with outward image and she feels like she needs to be trans to justify it,2,NOT
your gender fluidif you wanna be masculine and feminine,2,NOT

what gets me is how much work these evil companies have put into hiding this heinous crime they commit i think if everyone knew all the graphic details of what factory farms do most would at least cut back animal consumption thats why these companies go out of their way to make sure we cant find this information easily im one of the most curious people you will ever meet i have spent time researching almost everything including looking up sillyrandom topics like the history of watermelon but these companies go so far out of their way to hide this evil that even someone like me never stumbled up to this topic by myself my sister mentioned it to me a year ago and thats when i researched and learned about this horror even as a lifelong meat eater who loves meat and comes from a meat based culture i couldnt morally continue to partake in this evil i have been vegan since and will never touch meat again im very old school and grew up with the idea that men never cry or show emotions im basically the stereotypical tough guy who almost never shows emotions but ever since i learned about this evil act every once in a while it comes into my head and all i want to do curl up into a ball and weep for the poor defenseless animals that we torture so mercilessly we have to invent a new word for what we do to these poor animals because even the word evil doesnt cut it,2,NOT

i have the exact same reaction as piers morganwhen i ate meat i replayed the part of when he took a bite of plantbased burger or whatever it was his face contorted even before he took a bite most people react with disgust when tasting something they dont likeafter theyve taken a bite he had already made up his mind he wasnt going to like it but his facial expression revealed that it wasnt all that bad but because he had bashed vegan foodand of course because of his narcissistic personality he is belligerent and narrow minded they cant admit when they are wrongtheir way or the highway i went vegetarian in  i went vegan in  i became vegan after cutting out one food after another to figure out what was wrong with me i suffered gastrointestinal issues for years when i cut out dairy i was absolutely staggered at how much better i felt in one week i thought its got to be a fluke so i introduced small amounts of dairy thinking a little wont make any difference all i had was one small in x in x in slice of cheddar cheese i was in unbearable agony all night i had stomach and intestinal cramping that rivaled being in labor it was actually worse than labor because i was in horrible pain the entire night and part of the next day ive never had a childbirth labor last that long i gave my sister the remaining cheddar cheese packageshe isnt veganim the only vegan in my family there are millions of people who are allergic to nuts the food industry now has clear labeling for nut allergies it can be life threatening for some people to consume foods that contain nuts those of us who are severely lactose intolerant have struggled for years to find nondairy substitutes my best friend was vegan and told me about a website that would help me a lot it was peta i was heartbroken disgusted and angry when i looked at videos of farm animals being tortured every day after they suffer unimaginable agonizing pain just so people can have their meat i never really liked the taste of meat it always tasted like blood to me but because my parents were meat eaters i was forced to eat it along with the rest of my family the only way i could eat it was to mix tiny pieces into my mashed potatoes now as a  year old grandma i continue to refuse to enable industries that callously and inhumanly torture farm animals,1,NOT

my grandad told my mum she could only do a science degree because as a scientist himself he thought that was all that mattered and that it would give her better prospects shes not naturally gifted in sciences and would have enjoyed something like english or philosophy much more as that is what shes good at my mum has a decently paid job now but has low job satisfaction and always says she wishes she had been allowed to follow her passion this is what would have to happen on a societal scale to close the wage gap youre advocating for women to make choices they will regret for the rest of their lives,2,NOT
the wage gap is bull and women dont want to make more money this is larger due to the fact that men are more risky and are willing to work more theyre also more greedy these things are not bad women are and always will be better parents,5,ABU
it always makes me laugh how many youtube commenters think they came up with some factors that a group of people who run scientific studies for a living did not think of,2,NOT
women make  to a mans  but the mans only left with ,2,NOT
didnt this video just prove the wage gap doesnt exist by proving that kids are the reasons why there is a gap if men took care of kids more wouldnt the gap shift to men or better yet just not have any kids and eliminate the gap,2,NOT
wait  did they just admit that women make less money because of  personal choices thats racist,3,NOT
i dont really see the problem youve proven that the wage gap or earning gap which is a more accurate name is just a natural thing which happen in a free society were people make their own decisions and different choices have different consequences why should we change how different jobs works that would require the government stepping in and changing things and thats sounds to much like communism or big government,2,NOT
dont have kids its not worth it also screw  to  on top of inflexible working hours you have to waste your life away stuck in traffic because some morons decided it was a good idea to all go to work at the same time,2,NOT
i always find it weird how someone will try and take an academic approach to a controversial topic and still get hate like what are people so up in arms about the video is literally just citing what studies found,2,NOT
your argument is based on raising children and that those children are raised by a women not sure we as a society should be okay with that conclusion,2,NOT
dont have kids,2,NOT
what people also miss is that the wage gap isnt real,2,NOT
talk about being way better than buzzfeed,2,NOT
but when will something be done about the pay gap between white men and asian men this oppression must end,2,NOT
thank god some women are neutral and arent full on feminists and hate men,5,ABU
if theyre comparing median pay wouldnt that be off of a limited set of data in a way,1,NOT
how many people got eye cancer watching this,2,NOT
i mean with the system that we have its impossible to ever get to a discussion about the wage gap im not a woman i dont know what its like in the workplace as a woman im still a student i havent even worked before if you go on the internet and look for studies you will find what satisfies your agenda but you wont necessarily find things that accurately show the practical lives of women in the workplace unless you actually go through women to women telling everyone that they are experiencing all sorts of discrimination which are relatively unique to women men have their own problems theyre treated awfully in dangerous work they dont even get the proper care they need when injured they work longer hours and are even pressured at times to do so to the point where they want to do so a system in place to ensure that both men and women are paid the same for the same positions of the same jobs with the same level of commitment should be in place everywhere and there is really no denying that i couldnt care less about labels such as feminists or mens rights activists i care about the truth whether or not it challenges my own deeply held beliefs its really hard to face them but you have to do it or others and yourself will suffer,2,NOT
lets be clear there should not be a wage gap at all when men and women with the same education in the samesimilar jobs should not make k less than their male counterparts from the start women should not be making  less over a significant portion of their working life compared to men that comes out to millions of dollars women lose out on,1,NOT
i concur with the notion of increasing flexibility of hours but i find that to be an inevitability and moot from this perspective,1,NOT
as one of  males at my job with  female co workers who constantly call off switch days or just feel like cramping at work there should be a wage gap the law under osha says all work is to be equal male or female and its not men work harder and more is expected of them so who do i sue if im expected to do your job honey i want your money,3,NOT
there is no wage gap its literally been illegal to pay a woman less than a man since the s,2,NOT
there is no wage gap there is an earning gap because there are more women in lower paying jobs like nursing teaching etc because that is what more women choose to do,2,NOT
sooo pretty much just tell the father to take care of his kids,2,NOT
not as radical as i expected but the argument is limp dicked,3,NOT
expected feminist propaganda instead got a fair video explaining that the wage gap exists for a reason not because of sexism if only all of voxs videos were this unbiased and werent seeping with propaganda,3,NOT
wait people still believe in the wage gap come on this is the most basic issue there is and people believe it,2,NOT
maybe women make less because they do not have the same pressure men have to get a well paying job is generally considered a bit embarrassing if a man makes less than his wife so the man is pressured to work more and try harder for better jobs,2,NOT
i dont know about you guys but i would be grateful to make  a year,1,NOT
wage gap is fake news,2,NOT
vocal fry is annoying,2,NOT
there is no gender pay gap its illegal to pay someone less based on their gender its been illegal for quite some time,2,NOT
im surprised vox would actually tell the truth,2,NOT
you make it sound like a mother spending time for her kid is obligatory they choose to do it,2,NOT
men work harder than women,2,NOT
so your admitting this is mostly based on choices not discrimination now if i wanted to look at this through the lense of victimhood i could say that men are forced by society to work rigid hours to provide for a family even though they may not want too,2,NOT
so women earn less because they and men think that woman is the only one who is responsible for domestic works therefore it still is a gender problemthat is what you are missing vox and this is only us statistics what about the other countries for example things are very messed up in turkey they really do pay less a female engineer and a male engineer for no reason,2,NOT
thank you vox i never thought you would do this,1,NOT
women and men get paid the same for the same work,2,NOT
i bet if they made a man say this they would have been a lot more dislikes,2,NOT
women in aggregate and men in aggregate have different work profiles so why would you expect them to have identical pay outcomes,2,NOT
so the wage gap isnt about discrimination its just a natural consequence of the way human nature operates in a given level of technological advancement and abundance,3,NOT
yay vox waita not buy into femenist dogma and rationally explain it thank god if only the olympics video had done the same tho,5,ABU
ooh look a video about the wage gap im gonna say something about it not existing to make my memeaddict virtual friends think im smart without watching the video,2,NOT
if most women prefer staying home more hours over wasting most of their lives in some company and that makes them happier who am i to judge and to be fair it does seem smarter than some workaholic decisions men make,2,NOT
also in the uk the women earn p every pound not true and feminism is cancer,5,ABU
wage gap is fake,2,NOT
womens pay gap gets smaller when shes older cause the guy already retired from work so there doesnt earn as much also  average wtf the overall average her is around ,2,NOT
there is no such thing as a wage gap men simply work more statistically work harder jobs  of deaths and injuries on a workplace is men this id because women simply dont want to have these jobs and generally work less than men so there is no wage gap men just work harder and that is a statistical fact and i dont care what you say yes there are women who work hard but not as much as men so this whole wage gap thing is just bs that women want us to believe to give them even more of what they want stop using your gender as an excuse and if you use taking care of a child as an argument you are even more ridiculous dont have kids then if you want to pursue a career,3,NOT
thanks for making a fairly unbiased factual video it was leaning a bit left but you made a lot of good points and explained the differences in women and men in the workforce  for using your platform to educate,2,NOT
not really a wage gap more an earnings gap,2,NOT
im so sick of hearing so much about the wage gap the only reason why there is a wage gap is because women are usually the ones that take care of the kids and then when the women go back to work when they are  they are starting a new job so they obviously dont get paid as much as the guy thats been working that same job for  years its not a wage gap its a gap between new workers and experienced workers my parents were both engineers working for the same company in the same job and my mom made less money than my dad purely because she was  years behind in experience,2,NOT
wage gap is a myth,2,NOT
wow im actually shocked vox a liberalbiased news source actually puts out real facts instead of the sjwagenda this is a step in the right direction the wage gap is not because of discrimination or women purposefully being paid less by male employers this was made illegal with the equal pay act of  it exists because on average women choose lowerpaying jobs are generally obviously there are exceptions less assertive when it comes to payraises and work less hours due to things such as maternity leave raising a family etc,2,NOT
we dont get custody,2,NOT
this is going to flip eventually academically females are far out performing males in addition many male dominated industries that dont necessarily depend on higher education are being outsourced or automated recent statistics referenced on other videos similar to this one suggest that almost every college degree holding profession with the exception of stem fields are already majority women also recently there has been a focus on equalizing that field do no doubt this field will see dwindling male presence it make financial sense that the spouse with the lowest earning potential stays home with kids ie house husbands soccer dads,2,NOT
theres clearly some numbers here that make sense but i bet if u make the variables more commonexperience and seniority and productivity and actual individual cases we would see virtually no difference and of course women are going to have more inclusion in raising the child in the earlier years its just nature that why you they produce milk and actually give birth proper men put it on themselves to become better bread earners in order to support their family and theres nothing wrong with that its crazy to think that theres people out there who think these gender roles are oppressive and misogynistic if i was a women i would have no issue taking maternity leave to take care of my new child while i know my husband is working hard for our families future,2,NOT
wage gaps have been illegal since the s,2,NOT
so what this is saying is that to end the wage gap a night job must pay the same as a day job and risky jobs must pay the same as safe jobs and remove the overtime extra pay sorry but that looks a bit unfair thanks for clearing up what you want done to end the wage gap,2,NOT
earnings gap compare wages for the same position in the same job and that silly gap disappears different pay for different positions is nomal in cases that there is a pay gap for the same work in the same position that is sexism ill need some citations if you find any company that does this and should be changed as it is illigal to pay a women less for the same work,2,NOT
wow and i thought i was doing alright when i got out of business school i wasnt even in the same bracket as these men or women,1,NOT
for a culture change to happen it all starts with woman its their decision on what job they want its their decision if they want to stay at home and raise a family no one is forcing any of this on you if you end up with kids but dont want to quit working then dont talk about it to your spouse dont just accept it as oh im a woman so he expects me to quit my job no thats a stupid mentally youre just hurting yourself with a mind like that of course there are jobs out there that will prove too difficult for woman and thats just how our bodies were made men have more muscles than woman and their body structure helps with hard jobs but if you want that job too ladies you can although some might say its easier for men to grow in strength doesnt mean woman cant either,1,NOT
fyi this study is only w caucasian women this is not the truth for women in minorities that make much less,1,NOT
its literally bull tho lmao,3,NOT
i would like a video discussing men being stay at home fathers and the discrimination they face please,2,NOT
gender is a social construct though,2,NOT
surprised this has more likes than dislikes,2,NOT
 of women outearn their husbandspartners there are tree possible scenarios both earning the same  chance man earns more  chance woman earns more  chance  of women outearn their husbandspartners,3,NOT
thank you vox for making the sources for all of this easier to see by putting them in the description,1,NOT
the video alludes to women working in different fields  lower paid fields  earning less money and then goes on to completely ignore this for the rest of the video part of the sexism of the wage gap is that femaledominated professions are paid at lower rates than maledominated professions this isnt because they take on less risk or are less valuable to society it is because the value of these roles is not acknowledged because traditionally the value of women is not acknowledged the nursing profession the teaching profession the childcare profession  these are all highly valuable to society and high risk yet the are paid lower amounts,1,NOT
the real problem here is to put the man to attend kids and focus more on family not to create flexible working hours so that the woman take all the family responsibilities,1,NOT
women are like  well why dont the men take care of the kids well if you let us take care of the kids you dont want us taking care of the kids ,2,NOT
this is a flat out lie wage gap is a lie and right up there with the pink tax just complete and total bs just check out any of the hundreds of videos on this or the few right next to where you are reading this or hey just look it up and think for gods sake liberals seem to have that in very short supply this is a liberal voting tool so yep you libs get this,3,NOT
i find it interesting that you guys dont give the percentage for the wage gap with in an industry it shrinks to  mmmm wonder why you lezve that bit out,2,NOT
lets imply pay gap is real for equal job quality and availability paying for men vs woman work is just unfair if thats true why anyone would like to hire man they could get same job done for lower cost,2,NOT
wow they actually halfway explained the facts instead of just blaming it on sexism they did leave out that during this time one of the major reasons that the responsibilities with children were so unequally distributed was because this was a time when about half of marriages ended in divorce and fathers rights were being trampled on by the courts and fathers were expected to pay child support and alimony out the ass while having little to no interaction with their kids so of course if your husband is giving you a check your not going to work as much as the man that has to pay that check things have gotten better with fathers rights now due to men who fought for them with angry feminists battling them the entire way but hey this is a big improvement over five years ago when this video wouldve been the wage gap exists because im a victim and im a woman so if you try to prove me wrong with facts youre sexist,2,NOT
 of the comments are literally men obstinately stating it doesnt exist full stop with no evidence or explanation on a detailed video with backed with research and explanation on the wage gap are you guys even trying,1,NOT
just wait for the height equality movement,1,NOT
do a video on the gender death gap in the workplace,1,NOT
i cant see why this has over  dislikes do people not undertand that the truth is different from many narratives,1,NOT
holy crap  seconds into the video and shes already cited an incorrect fact using the median income for males and females assumes that men and women are equally represented in all areas of the workforce equally educated and equally experienced an easy way to show this is to compare the number of males in ceo positions as compared to women the stupid amount of money that ceos make is going to skew that statistic by a lot a different study that compared individuals in the same field with similar experience and education found that the income ratio was closer to   and the  discrepancy was made up for by men prioritizing pay over job satisfaction and men pushing for raises more aggressively i really wish people would do better research for videos pertaining to this topic the wage gap is essentially gone in most sectors of the job market,2,NOT
the wage gap is a myth,2,NOT
because a man has to work for family and a woman has a choice to be a housewife,2,NOT
there is no wage gap pay is commensurate to the experience and ability of one to perform the tasks in a job this means if you put the exact same hours in the exact same amount of effort and professionalism into a job your paycheck will show it it has nothing to do with gender skin color sexual orientation or any other trivialities women have different priorities so their paychecks show it,2,NOT
blasphemy how dare you use science and data to smear women you are a sexist and you should be fired stop advancing gender stereo type you bigot,2,NOT
feminists defending the wage gap is like fundamentalist christians defending the existence of their god they shift the goal post so much and expect us to believe that has always been their argument god of the gaps talk wage gap of the gaps,2,NOT
both my husband and i work in tech and i must agree what she says about tech jobs is true we have much more flexibility with our jobs and are able to get away when our daughter needs us to without causing a workday disruption both of us can handle most any asap problem from our smartphones,1,NOT
excellent video which actually represents facts and figures well done ,1,NOT
the gape doesnt exist because studies have shown that many more men go into higher paying jobs and women will not usually make the choice to work later hours according many studies and when men stay longer they get promoted faster and that earns more money so the gender wage doesnt exist,2,NOT
so dishonest and politicized,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist ive lost all respect for this channel,2,NOT
how did these guys get k from a business degree ,1,NOT
aaaaand let the shitstorm ensue,2,NOT
i love how its all men saying the age gap doesnt exist lmao,3,NOT
oooooor its because women and men choose different careers and choose different actions in life jk its not like america is a free country or anything,3,NOT
great video my only recommendation is that for a data heavy presentation like this you make you citations more accessible a lot of them would be really interesting to follow up also when you present try to sit up because when you lean over you have less control of the air coming out of your body and it leads to excessive vocal growls at the end of every sentencewhich is a common nervous issue great use of diagrams and i appreciated the slight pauses inbetween dense bits of data also a great job of breaking down statistics i have a much better understanding of what issues are related to wage gaps now after seeing this video,2,NOT
tbh she lost me during the video she jumped between too many things from what i saw she didnt explain about how the waige gap is calculated she didnt explain how ment tend to work overtime women on average work  hour weeks while men work about  hour weeks if you divide the numbers women roughly work  of the time now if we calculate time taken off for child care vacations ect women will work far less than men not including the overtime men work she also didnt talk about how women tend to choose lower paying jobs and fields than men theres another huge factor,3,NOT
this was great vox you really were unbaised on this sensitive issue,1,NOT
the misconception about the wage gap is that it exists,5,ABU
this makes alot more sense than the blatant accusation that men get paid more just because theyre men,2,NOT
so women make less because they are lazy wow what a shocker,5,ABU
if you can prove that women are underpaid even though they have same job same task same employer same hours same years of experiences same efficiency same company and the same productions then i will believe in wage gap,3,NOT
women arent equal in the us until the era is passed so this is just one issue of a larger one,2,NOT
a woman debunked the myth,3,NOT
so essentially the gap does not exist thanks for a misleading video,2,NOT
i think we need to examine the craig gap because it sounds like everyone makes more money than me ,2,NOT
men make more because they have harder jobs,5,ABU
work more hours and the wage gap disappears thats pretty obvious considering the only reason the wage gap was a thing was because on average women tend to work less at lower paying jobs not because theyre paid less for equal work,3,NOT
the wage gap has been debunked many many times,3,NOT
women earn less on average because they work less on average as every alegit statistic shows u guys are supposed to be factual and shouldnt lie about stuff like this to make women look opress when theyre not,5,ABU
what about the single moms and dads who take car of the kids,2,NOT
 its not real  the end,5,ABU
if there was a gender wage gap all businesses would be hiring women only they would cost less,3,NOT
that there isnt one,3,NOT
while i like the idea of reducing wage differences between sexes im deeply skeptical of increasing flexibility in many fields of work as flexibility often in practice means that the employee be available when the employer needs them and not that employees enjoy more selfdirection it might be true for highereducated professions but for working class people flexibility can simply be a euphemism for a business conveniently refusing to hire them full time so families have to resort to multiple parttime jobs in order to make ends meet sometimes with shortterm contracts and very uncertain employment conditions,3,NOT
so were admitting that its down to life choices,3,NOT
great video vox well presented and neutral in its stance,1,NOT
ok if women were paid less then why arnt every jobs full o woooomeeeen,3,NOT
the thing i miss the most about the gender wage gap is when it existed for real,3,NOT
one of the only decent vox videos,2,NOT
work as muchas hard as memake as much as mehow is this hard to understand the gender wage gap is really just an excuse because its not real the way feminists present it,3,NOT
heres another way to solve this issue let grown adults and employers make free will decisions for themselves and the government stay out of it,2,NOT
equal pay act of ,2,NOT
really interesting video some genuine awesome food for thought unlike the comments section,2,NOT
if women really got paid less than why wouldnt businesses only hire woman so they wouldnt have to pay as many wages,2,NOT
who tf is making a hundred grand right out of business school,2,NOT
ps maybe its race,3,NOT
lesson if you want to earn more money dontt have kids,2,NOT
that lack of intersectionality though,2,NOT
are you talking about a wage difference or an annual earnings difference because that is the common issue with this topic the wage is the same its the annual earnings that are different,2,NOT
the thing is women are just better at some stuff and men are better at some stuff id rather have a woman raise my child while i go bust my ass working construction to provide where is the argument,2,NOT
when even vox is not parroting feminazi bullshit,7,ABU
what people miss answer  the fact that its made up propaganda based off of an inability to actually read statistics in a correct and educated manner,5,ABU
i think we also need to talk about how no matter what though there is always a slight gap when comparing women and men even with every variable controlled not as high as the base gap but there always is one that put men ahead,2,NOT
your salary depend on the job you choose or the one you manage to get not on your gender,2,NOT
i made a argument paper on why the wage gap is a lie using studies and facts and yet failed and i was also accused of hate speech,2,NOT
so its more so a difference in choices and earnings the wage gap is merely an earnings gap and has nothing to do with sexism or inequality,2,NOT
ok but you mentioned how the  to  statistic is just average salary and you said how women might typically take lesser paying jobs but you never specifically tied the two together,2,NOT
if trump was a girl,3,NOT
wait wait wait waiti thought it was because society hates women and men conspire to keep women out of high paying jobs are you implying that feminists have been less than honest with me about this stat,3,NOT
this video is surprisingly unbiased good job vox,2,NOT
so basically this video stretched out the fact that the wage gap doesnt exist in hopes that the stupid still believe that the wage gap does exist,5,ABU
all these stupid ass feminists out here saying theres a wage gap theres an earnings gap because of life choices but there is no wage gap,5,ABU
they get paid the same but they show up less  wage gap,3,NOT
if women were paid less wouldnt they just only employ women to save money,2,NOT
sooo the wage gap is only a thing because women generally work less why was this even an issue then,3,NOT
equal choices not equal opportunities,2,NOT
nice to see that they put in the effort to do some real research instead of pushing rd wave feminist rhetoric ill be honest i cringed when i saw the title,3,NOT
this is the most retarded video ive ever seen,5,ABU
ever hear of that man who devorced his wife because she can not support him financially,3,NOT
i missed everything because it doesnt exist,5,ABU
video provides a reasonable explanation why statistically wage gap is a thing and how it works kneejerks  second into the video post wage gap doesnt exist or this and that niche proffesion pay women more than men and close the video,3,NOT
america should be only white blond haired blue eyed men everyone else get out side of the wall make america great again,6,ABU
why do i get the feeling this women isnt really for menlol,2,NOT
its great that some people on the left are finally putting this myth to rest however im confused why they still have an issue with the wage gap now that theyve acknowledged its not sexism i dont understand why the difference in money matters if everyone is making their own choices to pursue their own goals,2,NOT
there is always goiung to be a wage gap that feminists will complain about men may work longer hours and there are more male workers and the equal pay act of  is manditory,3,NOT
there is a difference between wage gap and earnings gap and feminists dont seem to know this,3,NOT
social justice warriors,3,NOT
ok but this is acting like women doing a majority of work in raising a child is an insurmountable problem,3,NOT
when women wanna get into the sewers do landscaping get dirty and go into fields that risk their lives ofher than the military come back to me with this bs,5,ABU
what people miss about the wage gap it doesnt exist if you count the number of hours women on average work it narrows to roughly  if you take into account the different careers women choose it narrows down to  if you consider how women are less likely to ask for a promotion from their boss it narrows to  or even in some cases ,2,NOT
that there is none,3,NOT
so many dislikes for a fairly neutral video i liked it vox informative,2,NOT
i see two solutions to this problem wage increases for lowerincome jobs encourage women to take up ceo and political positions and ask for raises more its wellknown that women are not as interested on average in ceo and political positions as men that is why its fair that women make up  of politicians because about  of the people running for office are women if this has to do with their upbringing then this can be fixed but if this is just because women on average dont want those jobs then the only solution is to raise the wages on lowerincome jobs also i find it ironic that women in the us are the majority of people going to and graduating from college yet theyre still under represented in higher income positions,2,NOT
the gender wage gap does not exist ok,5,ABU
im sorry ive just looked at the third upside down graph and im done maybe if someone wants to redo this with intuitive charts i might be in,2,NOT
making hours more flexible at a larger variety of jobs is better for both men and women who work i dont see why this is so controversial,2,NOT
conflicting earnings with wages you even say they take less paying jobs men take more dangerous jobs and put in more hours and of course women have more responsibilities of a baby it starts from the beginning men dont lactate lol they dont get paid less for the same job just like you said the jobs are requiring things they dont want to do like specific schedules you cant have it all,2,NOT
really well explained,2,NOT
the wage gap is caused by women themselves due to their career lifestyle financial choices etc it has nothing to do with employers or the patriarchy if women were paid less than men then why wouldnt employers only hire women,2,NOT
the video kinda proved that the pay gap doesnt exist by itself however let me rephrase it women are paid less on average because they make different lifestyle choices like working dangerous jobs in remote areas what the video asserts is the solution is to change the way businesses operate to suit workers while this is ideal for getting rid of a number previously proven to mean nothing the gender wage gap this will never happen as meetings are not scheduled around home life and if they are they will be erratic and inefficient as such while this is one example i think the message that should be taken from one of voxs best political videos is that the wage gap is while a fact not one that is directly indicative of the common implication that men are paid more,2,NOT
field of business demands lot of skills couple are risk taking and dominant behavior men are naturally more risk takers and try to defeat their rivals hence men on field of business generally tend to do better results and hence are more desirable therefore better pay also there is no such thing as wage gap its earning gab which is based on experience education talent how long they spend at job and how often they get sick once these things have been taken into account then that gab suddenly is almost nothing,2,NOT
who else is looking for feminists in the comments,2,NOT
so the solution to gender based income inequality is not having kids simple as that ive been saying this for years have the babies in a lab let the machines and professional care takers bring them up and let people live their lives free of such a burden oooh but i love my children you dont know the miracle your life is never the same blablabla the bio link that makes us crazy about kids is there to protect the species but if we outsource the reproduction cycle and the education of the children we could finally have a truly egaletarian society until then women will always do more no way around that its a brave new world yall,2,NOT
 was  years ago my guy,1,NOT
but how can feminists blame an invisible enemy for all their problems if this is true,3,NOT
vox is even admitting its not based on people being sexists can feminists shut up now,5,ABU
well not to sound like a d moron like hunter avallone but i hate to break it to you the wage gap was debunk numerous of times and it has been a mess for a very very long time however talk about women that are suffering from real depression i can the middle east or an africa on other places in the world ,3,NOT
this makes a lot of sense my mom is an attorney which means hours are flexible and can be done whenever as long as they are completed at her firm you can see how much everyone makes and shes always made as much or more than male counterparts so ive never really believed in the gender wage gap,2,NOT
as a lot of this is true but i disagree about one thing the gap while this does depend on the job and the person you arent literally earning  for my  if you were then more people would hire women just like they do illegals,2,NOT
why not give  women already in top  who have been psychologically profiled as unwilling to distribute their money to the bottom  an extra trillion or two dollars then youll have distribution of wealth similar to how it is among men and then youll have raised the amount women earn the way it is distributed among men  mens lives arent better in the slightest and arent earning a dime more because a bunch of people at the  top are disproportionally men,2,NOT
pay rate is the same for men and women  if you ladies want to earn the same as men doing the same job stop complaining get off your arse and work the same amount of hours,5,ABU
this girls kardashian style vocal fry almost made my ears bleed,5,ABU
i saw women typing on typewriters and making food during the times men were in war yup thats definitely equal work but thats ok women arent built to work super hard thats the mens job,5,ABU
first time i see vox slightly nudging the liberal agenda instead of going allout leftist nicely done,3,NOT
vox now declared antifeminist due to its correct and factual ideology of the wage gap,3,NOT
wage gap has been debunked over and over,3,NOT
women will always innately take the role of caregiver moreso than their spouse thus continuing the stigma of unreliability in the workplace if women want to make a change it starts at home,3,NOT
long story short women consistently choose jobs that pay less then blame women for it they are also more likely to take time off less likely to work overtime more likely to leave for pregnancy less likely to act for a raise and less likely to ask for a promotion there are studies on all of this but it doesnt fit the feminist narrative so its ignored,5,ABU
so what are we supposed to take out from this video the problem that has been shoved down to our throats for years isnt actually a problem or the work hours are misogynist what should we do now make men mothers instructions unclear,3,NOT
and although that statement is factually true cite your sources honey,2,NOT
the pay gap itself comes down to submissiveness if you dont stand up for a better wage you forfeit it and you cant complain men tend to follow the ask and it will be given to you principle more all potential employees men or women are usually offered a standard to low rate its your responsibility as an individual to deny a lowball offerask for a higher offer for if you accept it you share equal guilt to the unfair transaction and have no right to contest what you forfeit and as women tend to forfeit more than men its not the pay gap thats an issues its the inability to ask its not just women many men also fail to ask modern day feminists tend to find excuses and demonize the patriarchy they believe exists to deny their fault note just because you believe something to be true doesnt mean it is and if the patriarchy does exist its because women let it happen,5,ABU
probably the definitive book on this is warren farrells why men earn more written some four years before this study it identifies  areas where men on average make different decisions than women on average that is all the points made in this video and more the central insight is that the road to higher pay is a toll road higher pay generally means sacrificing something lowerpaid people do not why this is so important is that realising the actual reasons for the earnings gap empowers women  and men for that matter  to make choices to boost their earning potential if thats what they want to do any given person has of course the right to decide that they dont want to miss their kids soccer game move to the other side of the country or work in a highly stressful and competitive environment areas of their life other than their paycheck will doubtless benefit its just a bit silly for anyone  regardless of gender  to make these choices then turn around and compare their paycheck with another person who decided the money was important enough to them for them to make these and other sacrifices,3,NOT
this video triggered me everyone knows women are evil harpies why else could i possibly be a virgin still,5,ABU
people need to realize its not the s its  were all equal and just because you a man dont mean u have to be hard tough and emotionally strong and risk our lives just as women dont have to stay in the house,2,NOT
its as simple as if women get paid less then men then there would be no men working because women are cheap labour just like immigrants,3,NOT
fair play to vox you were the last people i expected to make a video like this i understand you are still hyperliberal but we all appreciate these types of factual rather than ideological videos,3,NOT
i would suggest staying out of the comment section fellow video viewer lots of fuckery going on down there,5,ABU
the wage gap doesnt take into account choices between the genders a wife nagging the husband to take on another job and the fact that women get pregnant and take a break for a year or so,3,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap the fact it doesnt exist  women have better chances of getting higher paying jobs than men,5,ABU
first youll need to explain how many genders exist  does this video mean that you agree there are only two genders,3,NOT
even though vox makes videos i sometimes dislike and some i like it is still one of my favorite youtube chans this way of explaining and thinking about things is what we need more of in this crazy world,2,NOT
i think all of the dislikes came from people who didnt bother to watch the video,3,NOT
so what do women want do they want men to subsidize them so they can work less and still earn the same sorry not gonna happen i work for my own living not anyone elses as it stands women already use and get more benefits from social services than men do even though men are the ones that pump more money into the system because they work more anyway im glad the feminist have finally accepted that their  cents for every dollar data is defective and incomplete they never would have accepted that before so this is progress,3,NOT
a lot less biased than i expected,2,NOT
she also failed to mention how its just a gap in work out in not salary of the job women still get paid the same as men for the same hours and work put in,3,NOT
you forgot all the other  genders,3,NOT
men work higher earning jobs women choose to work jobs in fields like social sciences and arts get over yourself,3,NOT
a video on the wage gap that isnt by liz plank i thought the day would never come,3,NOT
again i want to commend vox for allowing comments almost all of the other sjw networks ban comments because they cant handle it thank you vox that being said  you are wrong the fact that most of the other networks covering this issue ban comments is a big sign that you are wrong they need to ban discussion on the topic to protect their fragile opinions i commend you for allowing the comments,2,NOT
feminists be like i work  hours less than a coal miner as a babysitter therefore we should get paid the same well russia communism has finnaly made its way over i believe,3,NOT
the truth is that women take on a disproportionate share of childrearing tasks oh you mean like pregnancy and breast feeding two things men physically cannot do this isnt sexism vox its just a natural outcome of the roles that biology has assigned males and females,3,NOT
women earning on average  less than men yes women earning  less for the exact same job nooo  annoying myth,5,ABU
not the video i expected when i saw this was vox great work,2,NOT

argh that vocal fry is unbearable,3,NOT
we live in the political correctness era why dont these women sue these companies for gender discrimination,3,NOT
jesus i should have gone to that business school,1,NOT
literally the only way to fix the socalled wage gap which is bullshit would be to across the board pay women more for the same work literally by creating a wage gap to pay women more than men for the same jobs which i should add is highly illegal,5,ABU
imagine the hate if this video was narrated by a man,2,NOT
in other words its not sexism,3,NOT
vocal fry stop it,3,NOT
ok if youre doing studies on people making over k a year and then comparing wage gaps then i want nothing to do with this this seems like an elitist problem to me,2,NOT
what about the difference in race helloooooo,2,NOT
women am i right,3,NOT
so you are basically saying that there is a wage gap because men and women are doing different work deep,2,NOT
the thing they miss is that its a myth,5,ABU
male hookers get paid less than female hookers solvehookergenderwagegap,3,NOT
you missed the part where men work harder,3,NOT
if i could pay a woman less to do the same work i would only hire women,2,NOT
warning triggered feminazis and misogynists before,6,ABU
tldw men and women make different choices also in case vox is sitting at home scratching their heads wondering why da people whoz watch our videos no like dis video  its because you guys are usually not fair andor objective this is one of the rare times where you mostly are people who saw vox making a gender pay gap video automatically assumed you would be spewing the same old biased bullshit,5,ABU
this is wrong you cant make money when your major is gender studies,3,NOT
you know what people miss about the gender wage gap its nonexistence,3,NOT
how about all the time taken post maternity that goes unpaid or any additional time off needed,2,NOT
if companies could pay women less for the same work theyd never hire a man why pay a man a dollar to do the same everything that a woman will do for seventyseven cents,2,NOT
the vocallll fryyyyy in this videoooo is brutalllllll,3,NOT
im going to be a single parent when i grow up and i can see myself having the same schedule as women do,1,NOT
yeah thats an earnings gap,2,NOT
umm lion tamer  at the end,2,NOT
thank you vox for finally have a non polarizing and very interesting video for once please stay like this because i really like your content and when you do a video like the feminist olypmics video it just makes you look polarizing,3,NOT
there was one thing that i think is important about the business type jobs too and that is that they are often more physically demanding jobs that women tend to shy away from,2,NOT
stop saying wage gap women make the same amount of men per hour however because they dont complete the same hours they also dont go into the same fields as men they choose less paying jobs thats why there is an illusion that women make  cents on the dollar,3,NOT
there is on wage gape simple sorry feminists,3,NOT
the wage gap has been reduced since  thats a given noone claimed there to be a  wage gap in  in fact back then the wage gap was closer to  to  on a long term effect laws and policies have lowered the gap considerably you can argue that women have different jobs than men but the fact is that they dont work  less hours so they shouldnt be paid  less regardless of what their occupation is you see the exact same thing when you compare the  poorest americans with the other  of americans the hour difference is nowhere near being equal to the wage difference,2,NOT
flexible hours alone wont be the solution but a part of it essentially it would help if men would take the same responsibility for their children otherwise childcare will always remain a woman problem,2,NOT
wage gap women are not eqaul to men psychologically more unstablehormonally unbalanced and men tend to have better judgement and are more driven the women who do well emulate those traits switch women and men for women being a starving athlete and men as bodybuilders no one would complain if the body builder lifted more weights could out eat moreyet we do the same for womenboxers have weightclasses for a reason,5,ABU
if women are paid less then men then why dont business hire them,2,NOT
isnt there an equal pay act in america,2,NOT
there is no such thing as a wage gap lol,5,ABU
if feel like if you live in a first world country you shouldnt even complain about stuff like this man or woman there are bigger problems than this,2,NOT
exactly thank you i think people who pretend that its  cents on the dollar for the same job are doing more harm than good and unfortunately that includes some people in the public spotlight like obama the implication is that women earn less because employers are mysogonists who systematically opress their female employees duh yet thats not whats happening there are many factors to consider the most obvious one being that men dont get pregnant and that women are less likely to disregard their family life and children in favor or their jobs,2,NOT
more videos like this please,2,NOT
you missed the fact that men are more likely to take risks at work for that reason men are more likely to both become millionaires or commit suicidebecome homeless,2,NOT
as a business owner if i could hire women to do the same job as men and get away with paying them less i would have only women working for me so would every other business this statement alone should be enough to end this debate once and for all,3,NOT
like ive always said wage gap is a joke ive said this exact thing years ago and was laughed at plus in most hourly wage jobs that require physical labor men are usually grossly underpaid while women are overpaid if youve ever worked in a warehouse type job that requires lifting you know im telling the truth the fact is men need fewer days off and we are genetically built to work women are built to reproduce thats not sexism its fact i respect women and if they can do the job they deserve to be paid for it more often than not they are men usually can work more hours and take fewer days off thats the gap not sexism,3,NOT
the only thing people miss about the wage gap is the fact that it doesnt exist,3,NOT
vox you surprise me,2,NOT
a mother has to mother or its just another scumbag on this earth men also make up  of workplace fatalities thats a huge clue,6,ABU
vox if the real issue is women doing more housekeeping than men and so working and earning less its not a wage gap its a housekeeping gap and its no place for government regulation,3,NOT
the gap dusnt egsist,5,ABU
this better be how it doesnt exist,3,NOT
no mention of how many hours are worked per a week what if you dont work just  what if you work  hrs a day instead,2,NOT
tldr its just as most of us have been saying for years women dont work as many hours in general mythbusters,5,ABU
it would be ironic if the women oops my bad the whole cast of making this were paid just over minimum wage while some rich white jew was raking in stacks as the ceo that would really prove their point,5,ABU
i was about to dislike the video before even watching it but i found out that i actually agree with everything mentioned in this video,2,NOT
this video actually proved that the wage gap doesnt exist,3,NOT
do they count all the men that have died doing more dangerous jobs and all the men in jail,2,NOT
i think the modern countries have pretty much overcome the whole gender bias thing the only industry i see that is extremely sexist is movie industry there are a lot of things that dont comply with our modern values but are prevalent in the movie industry  yet these are one ofthe most influential people on earth,2,NOT
call it earnings gap not wage gap if you want to be accurate,2,NOT
maybe because of pregnant leave and all the time spent on their phones and gossiping with other coworkers during working hours,5,ABU
it is difficult to miss something that is non existent,3,NOT
she wasnt very convincing as a presenter honestly i like the data though,2,NOT
hey you people wanna see something funny go to indeedcom and look at the salaries for people working in buzzfeed men get paid less than women and more women work there and buzzfeed has a very small white amount of people working there talk about equality huh,2,NOT
she did a very good job of explaining this topic,1,NOT
its an earnings gap ughhhhhhh,2,NOT
 thats actually mathematically incorrect if a man earns  and a woman earns  that means that the man earns  more that the woman and that a woman earns  less than the man,2,NOT
of course just keep trying to focus on other factors and avoid the fact that men know how to do better in buisness so they earn more,5,ABU
quality info thx,2,NOT
there is no wage gap get over it vox,5,ABU
lets close the wage gap white straight men arent evil,3,NOT
companies want profit  the more the better let us say that a company could hire a woman who do the same job for less money why wouldnt the company not just hire women and fire all men i dont get it,3,NOT
unfortunate but true,2,NOT
its not wages its earnings,2,NOT
thats because the man is usually at work once again thats not sexist thats just a fact men tend to work while women stay home,3,NOT
its the babies kill the babies,6,ABU
considering the vast differences between the two demographics ive always wondered why people expect that the average wages of full time women workers and full time men workers are should to be the same,3,NOT
every time i hear about gender wage gap all i could think about is what jim jefferies said lol,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist,5,ABU
the wage gap doesnt exist the one study that said women make  cents to a mans dollar has almost nothing factored in if i work in nuclear science as a male im obviously going to make more money than a waitress people use this one inaccurate statistic as a weapon its sickening and its literally illegal to pay women less if you could pay women less why not hire all women itd cut  of expenses its because the wage gap does not exist,3,NOT
did you know that for every women who dies in the workplace  men die thats right companies are actively trying to kill men,5,ABU
also jobs that are considered female have a lower salary naturally nurses teachers child care professionals maids all have salaries that are significantly lower than say construction manufacturing and so on these jobs have a lower salary because historically they were female positions and since the female was nvr a main bread winner they could naturally pay them less,2,NOT
so youre basically telling us that the wage gap is because of womens choices,2,NOT
the charts make so sense even though you calmy explained it step by step,2,NOT
goddamnit men already explained thing about wage gap bogus since s people still talking bout this crap,3,NOT
women worker  works less then fellow male worker male worker  works more then women worker takes less vacation and works over time also doesnt take days off to see child if he has one women  gets paid less man  gets more women  suprised pikachu also pay gap has been disapproved by a women  equal opportunity  equal outcome,3,NOT
do you get maternity pay in usa in britain women always had longer time off than men but its been fixed now so men and women can share the maternity leave so the woman has the right to go strait back into work as soon as she has given birth and the man can stay at home to raise the child obviously the women might need a week off after giving birth but that shouldnt affect her career,1,NOT
i commend vox for making these kind of vids in spite of how sexist the youtube communitycomment section can be sometimes and dealing with the sexist backlash,2,NOT
wage gap is the average money a women makes a year this doesnt consider days off and sick days i hate to teach you this we mon take more days off than men and thats a fact,3,NOT
how can you make a video about the wage gap without mentioning the wage gap between black and white,2,NOT
women take on a disproportionate share of child rearing tasks by their own choice this is the thing that all of these analyses ignore people make individual choices about what they want for their own lives and those choices affect how likely they are to get promoted people have different personalities and those differences affect how likely they are to get paid more or get promoted on average women choose to stay home with children more than men on average women are more agreeable when in entry level positions and focus more on relationships rather than quantifiable results these are facts and they predict success in the workplace it is not sexism it is individual choices about worklife balance,3,NOT
conclusion there is not a wage gap there is an earnings and field access gap based heavily on hours flexibility with perhaps some employer bias based on the type of worker theyre looking for solution there is no direct solution plenty of things to help broadly though most of which involve innovation and an improved situation for all workers,2,NOT
how come they never provide examples of men and women working for the same company doing the same work and for the same amount of hours being paid differently,1,NOT
it not true make and females paid same,3,NOT
its also way more complicated then this clearly biased video is showing,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap what people miss about the gender wage gap is that it is not a wage gap instead it is earnings gap yeah i know  minor correction s,2,NOT
yeah lion tamer,2,NOT
tht thete isnt one,3,NOT
that it doesnt exist,3,NOT
lol the butthurt fascists in the comments make me laugh ,5,ABU
its more complex because its inaccurate it doesnt represent reality at all women and men at the same level of experience and seniority in the same fields earn pretty much the same the reason there appears to be a gap is as you said women hold disproportionately more lower paid jobs like child care etc whereas jobs with higher wages like dangerous jobs or jobs in stem fields are predominately male filled men also work for more years on average and take less paternity leave than women take maternity leave mostly because theyre offered a lot less men are also more aggressive in salary negotiations on average and are more likely to ask for a raise,2,NOT
this is insane wage gap is nothing but a lie,5,ABU
individuals tend make the same wages for the same jobs regardless of gender who cares about averages they dont matter and the idiot masses dont know how to interpret them now stop lowering my earning potential all youve done is kept us all equally poor just ask around everyone in every business is paid the same crummy wages unless youre a friend of the family who owns the place,3,NOT
i just want discrimation groups to die in the usa things are already pretty pc and im tired of everything everyone says being hyper analyzed by these bloodthirsty people dicks in hands racismsexism isnt even defined by intent anymore just by the multitude of topics that could possibly offend ugh maybe the united states just needs a major bombing to set our priorities straight,5,ABU
cant let my wife see this video ,2,NOT
lets think about this it doesnt account for types of hours or amount that ive seen this means that if later hours pay more and they typically do then the later hours that are made up of men because of their flexibility are being compared as the same as lesser paying hours,2,NOT
stop it get some help,3,NOT
the wage gap was so misrepresented and basically a lie that outlets like vox are trying to salvage any last bit of legitimacy from it the problem is that the implied argument about fairness was never true why because the argument was tried in my view to try and subsidize female workers at the expense of male workers  that was the plan all along  something for nothing,3,NOT
women live longer than men do and if a woman is married to a man and that man suddenly dies she will be poor so the man has to earn more money during his life time so his wife can inherit some cash after he dies simple as that,3,NOT
no gender gape,2,NOT
do know companies would higher only women if they where cheaper to higher because your get better profit margins did to salaries bering lower this is what third wave feminist dont understand that it choices you make not what gender you are that shows difference in pay between men and women because work on average from women is statically less then men  have babies therefore  months to year off job  men are more willing to do more overtime than women  it pretty simple if you dont do the time you wont get a dime very simple basic economics,3,NOT
vox not being raging leftists i am doubtful of the underlying motive,3,NOT
i identify as a social democrat but i think a portion of the wage gap truly is due to other factors besides just sexism like experience time off and other factors a lot will disagree but ive looked at numerous studies i welcome all to do a lot the research yes sexism plays a role somewhat i just think people need to be realistic when it comes to issues like this im not saying this and other issues needs addressed in any way it does im just saying you cant put the blame on any on thing it is due to multiple factors sexism isnt anywhere near the top reason is all im saying debate me if you want but im not arguing and namecalling,2,NOT
so basically women get less money because of the jobs they have so a man and woman could get the same exact money for the same job and thats what women are getting mad about im just a noob on this topic so feel free to comment whether im right or not,2,NOT
i was watching the video but in truth i came here for the comments,1,NOT
you make the decision on this one but id recommend closing the comments on this vid as they tend to be a septic tank on topics like this,2,NOT
interesting the way gap appears to occurr during child bearing years,1,NOT
sub to me if theres only  genders,3,NOT
argued very well very rational and well explained gives you alot to think about,2,NOT
i like how you say its more complex seems like people on tumblr seem to never focus on the complexity of human society i swear tumblr has boarderline personality disorder,5,ABU
i call fakeif woman were paid less then why dont companies hire all woman,3,NOT
im betting you compare nurses to doctors in these studies as well wage gap is bullshit every woman in my life makes more than me and its not for my lack of trying,2,NOT
what a great video the dislikes are horrible wonderful research,2,NOT
we could tackle this problem indirectly by guaranteeing paid maternitypaternity leave sick leave and vacation time for all full time workers,1,NOT
the wage gap only refers to woman who are not poc the stats would be more valid if you took an intersectional approach,1,NOT
there isnt one men work more and try to get higher paying jobs while women go for their passion,2,NOT
women like making and raising babies why is this hard to understand,3,NOT
the wage gap is a myth if women got paid less than men then men wouldnt be employed,3,NOT
there is no wage gap because if there was no one would hire men lets say i was an employer why would i want to hire  men for  each when i could hire ten women  each as an employer i would like to spend the least money and therefore wouldnt hire men as they would cost me more wage gap disproven,3,NOT
if theres a wage gap why dont businesses only hire women,3,NOT
this is what antifeminists have been saying all along the earnings gap exists because women choose lower paying fields and work fewer hours than men it has nothing to do with discrimination it has nothing to do with sexism if a woman chooses to have children it will hurt her earnings potential that is just a fact of life women are free to make this choice no one is forcing it upon them,3,NOT
i just wasted  min watching the stupid video,2,NOT
show this to every feminist on earth,2,NOT
thing about the wage gap is how good someone is at the job how long theyve been there and time worked is commonly not taken into account,2,NOT
so for women to get paid fairly men trying to negotiate their own pay have to negotiate for their fellow womens pay because what they cant do it themselves ludicrous to think women shouldnt have to do any bargaining when negotiating their pay that when mens contracts get negotiated the womens contracts have to automatically be fulfilled with the same pay without putting forth the same effort the men did kinda goes against same pay for same work ethic,2,NOT
alright i can accept a lot of what is being said here one thing though with all of these discrepancies being shown how come they are rarely if ever acknowledged by the feminist community it seems rather manipulative i would be much more apt to listen in depth about what they are saying if they would actually disclose all information instead of nitpicking and im sure im not the only one,2,NOT
 is that it doesnt exist its an earnings gap,2,NOT
great if there is such a wage gape why arent businesses firing men and hiring more women they would save a fortune,3,NOT
equal pay act  an act to prevent discrimination as regards terms and conditions of employment between men and women the equal pay act  is an act of the united kingdom parliament which prohibits any less favourable treatment between men and women in terms of pay and conditions of employment,1,NOT
did you just assume my gender,2,NOT
booooooring work sucks as does feminism,3,NOT
its funny how these people treat choices as social obligations no one forces you to have kids nor to take care of kids while your husband doesnt this is not a social problem its an individual problem and to suggest that it has to do with discrimination thats just ridiculous,3,NOT
i didnt see manual labor why didnt i see manual labor,1,NOT
tbh i thin there should always be on person being the houshold caretaker and one to provide for the household and not both working at the same time,1,NOT
ive never seen a women working in waste management,2,NOT
these are some valid points the only thing i would add is as follows note i dont think that the pay gap exists but im open to different opinions if they have evidence of their thoughts  women since they give birth to the child they will most of the time be more caring towards a child  women also can get paid maternity leave in which they still get paid their same amount but taking care of a child  if a man and a woman are working in sales with commissions it depends on how they are selling if the man sells more he gets more money if the man sells less he gets less money and vice versa with women,2,NOT
gotta get into that burgeoning field of blimp piloting ladies,2,NOT
there is no gap women make different choices typically making them have a lower wage if they make the same choices as men the wage is the same,3,NOT
sec  states that any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of section  section  of this title shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than  or to imprisonment for not more than six months or both no person shall be imprisoned under this subsection except for an offense committed after the conviction of such person for a prior offense under this subsection this makes it illegal to pay women less than men based simply off of their gender therefore it makes the entire wage gap idea simply wrong due to this section that came straight out of the equal pay act that was approved by congress in the year of  on june th while the average man is more likely to take more dangerous jobs that offer more money while women are more likely to take less paying jobs such as psychology early education social work human services etc now take note that the wage gap is the average earnings of men and women working fulltime and it doesnt account for different job positions hours worked different jobs or even the same job it just accounts for the overall gain because of this it looks as women are payed less when placing the overall profit of men compared to women because the more dangerous jobs pay more while the ones women are more likely to take areobviously not but hypothetically speaking lets say that women are paid less on average it is said that women make  cents compared to every dollar a man makes which if you do the math can average down to  dollars lost in an average womans lifetime or  dollars each year if this were true then employers would only hire women so they could save  dollars every year that could go to something else would they not business owners arent stupid and they would certainly do almost anything it takes to have extra money in the bank so why arent they simple the wage gap is a myth created by feminists to bolster their sad excuse for a movement,5,ABU
simpson paradox you ignorant feminists,5,ABU
this is only a common thing that is brought up when talking about equality because it is misnamed a name that better suits this is a earnings gap because that is what it is theyre not paid a different wage for the same work they just earn less because of their actions,3,NOT
its not like my dad has had a really hard time finding a job since he stopped teaching and my mom works her ass off to support us my mom works an  to  job common in nb and she doesnt take as many vacations as a lot of other women plus she misses a lot of events me and my brother are involved in because of work which used to often take her across the province for a week or two does she get payed as much as a man who works the same hours holds the same position and takes as many vacations yes she does,2,NOT
you retards need to watch the video before commenting,5,ABU
so childish we have to have sound effects of crumpling paper or calk scratching or we cant learn what a farce disingenuous as well,2,NOT
so they debunked the wage gap then say its real smh,2,NOT
business school is a very broad term,1,NOT
the lesson is stop making men do chores they suck at it in everyway and any woman is x more motivated to do them ask our ancestors,3,NOT
i saw actually no proof what so ever most men and women dont work career jobs but by the hour jobs which do not have a wage gap,2,NOT
this representer is much better than the one who did the ish show she shows actual researchs and facts not like liz plank how just ramming all sorts of feminism down your throat,5,ABU
equal treatment does not mean equal results equality does not mean equity,2,NOT
i dont feel that the problem is is dramatic,2,NOT
guys i just had an argument with a friend about the wage gap and the paper she pulled up was a canadian one and it supposedly looked at all the choices and all that and then i kinda froze and went over about how its illegal and sounding like a broken record,2,NOT
wait why does it matter if women work less and in turn earn less than their husbands in order to take care of kids if they have a joint bank account and everything,2,NOT
k a year out of college is high for the average profession,1,NOT
that chair looks extremely uncomfortable,1,NOT
women take more holidays tham men,1,NOT
and just like that the pendulum swings facts are in again,2,NOT
i dont understand the fascination with balancing the wages of men and women it is illegal to pay women less than men for the same job end of discussion what happens if the wages between men and women are balanced will society as a whole join together around a campfire and sing songs about how we are finally equal i doubt it unless there is a clear discrimination happening then this is just a pointless thing to argue about,2,NOT
that there is none,2,NOT
there is not a gender wage gap there is an earnings gap the wage gap is average earnings of men and women working fulltime it does not account for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,3,NOT
if a woman chooses to be a mother it should be her primary role when the earnings gap is viewed in contrast to the lack of mens parental rights it makes sense women earn less because they can force their ex husbands to pay for everything if they want the burden of child rearing shared they should also share parental and reproductive rights,2,NOT
anybody who thinks that women earning less than men is a problem are somewhat wrong if a women wants to have a child and take care of that child then there is no need to try to make more women work i agree that it is an issue that jobs arent flexible enough for women who take care of children but in the en it makes no sense to change how the entire world works because some people find it hard to do well in work and take care of a child also if you think about it businesses pay the same amount of money to the same amount of staff so having less women working means there are more men working or other women working who could then support the women who have children money is not being lost from families if women work less,3,NOT
k of k is  so its  less and not  less should be something like while women were earning  of what men does no  less leaves ,1,NOT
this is a good video it takes into account that men are able to give more to a job because they traditionally have less responsibilities and indicates that women in the position to do the same equal close to the same amount a statistic glossed over quite often i have one contention however the video states that the concept of the wage gap is based on the difference in median income yet what most people actually say and believe is the following women make  cents on the dollar a man makes for the same job which is very different statement that indicates intentional oppression by employers,2,NOT
what vox missed it isnt a pay gap  thats been against the law since  its an earnings gap because people make different choices most women want to have children  its hardwired into our species are you suggesting that they shouldnt they also want to raise their kids and tend to select careers that allow them to do so are you suggesting that they shouldnt men work more hours work more overtime accept more dangerous and nasty jobs and are more willing to travel away from home for work if women want to earn more theres nothing stopping them all they have to do is spend more time working most seem to want more balance between work and family and that is absolutely fine but the you can have it all indoctrination promulgated by certain activists is pure absurdist fantasy nobody can have it all you have to prioritize and juggle,3,NOT
really shitty comment section,2,NOT
you had me and lost me why should we fix it its caused by the choices people make in their private lives and we have no business there,2,NOT
no mention of divorce outcomes yeah lets just ignore that obvious elephant in the room,2,NOT
wage gaps cant melt steel beams,2,NOT
eye one year business school  sign me up,1,NOT
no real economist supports the wage gap,1,NOT
could someone sum up the point this video is trying to make in a more comprehensible way,1,NOT
i honestly dont care because i aint about to give my salary away the same i dont expect them,2,NOT
i think this video does a better job of explaining the wage gap than most videos however they dont do a good job of accounting for men and women in the same exact career for example in my job as a lawyer where everyone in the equivalent position gets paid the same the wage gap should be nonexistent if there happens to be one its because women choose to work less hours than men for some reason not because theyre getting paid less women make different life choices than men so that should be accounted for,2,NOT
why should i care about people making the top  incomes in the united states,2,NOT
theres a reason economists dont buy the wage gap think if you could pay women less than men for the same output firms that hire more women would drive the business that hire more men out of business which doesnt happen,2,NOT
finally a video that gives good insight on the gender wage gap,2,NOT
doesnt exist in the uk we have minimum or living wage everyone is paid due to abilities and hours they work meaning more skill more pay per hour so if you want to fix the wage gap then work more men take jobs that are heavy hard working women take softer jobs like table services and retail,2,NOT
companies are all about profit they will choose the workers with the best qualityquantity  cheapness ratio they wouldnt gain anything by preferring anyone from a certain group to anyone from another group of people,2,NOT
the wage gap is fake look it up,3,NOT
why is the solution that work hours should become more flexible why is the solution not that dads should step up and do  of the chores why is the solution not that dads should spend just as much time taking care of their own kids,1,NOT
people aka lefties,2,NOT
studies show men on average have slightly higher brain volume fact smarter people get payed more coincidence,3,NOT
half the commenters just saw wage gap in the title got triggered then disliked at least watch the video,2,NOT
only commies believe in the gender wage gap myth,2,NOT
vage gap doesnt exist work hours  proffesions job type promotions and overtime are not accounted for it has been illegal  businesses to pay women less since the s if companies were able to get away whit it they would only hire woman real wage gap is between  or  depending on the field the reason  this is pregnancy and childcare wich makes women take less hours andor overtime there still is one but  an understandable reason,2,NOT
so youre saying that the gender pay gap has almost nothing to do with gender but more to do with hours and times worked life choices and the profession chosen yes thanks for confirming what rational people already knew ,3,NOT
essentially this video is correct and i agree with it however it is misleading to call it a wage gap if you want to get rid of the wage gap stop comparing yearly earnings hours worked times pay per hour but instead just compare the pay per hour there is no difference in pay per hour therefore no wage gap a womans decision to have children is her own choice and she should take into account that she will make less pay if she works less hours to take care of her children seems pretty obvious but anyway its not societies problem,2,NOT
there is no wage gap men work for more time,3,NOT
if women are paid  on the dollar compared to men why dont businesses hire more women then men or fire all their men and only employ women,3,NOT
wonder how much of the research is a result from phacking,2,NOT
oh what people miss  oh thats its a myth,2,NOT
didnt mention the solution of men taking more responsibility for their children i guess its implied but still,1,NOT
this doesnt account the type of job that men and women choose,2,NOT
if the wage gap existed wouldnt businesses only hire women to save money,2,NOT
conservatives rejoice you have forced corporate new media to report a neutral wage gap story that isnt completely flawed,2,NOT
i dont see any female worker in dangerous industry or any work that require intense training,2,NOT
im sorry who the fck makes   year out of business school  no seriously just graduated need that kind of money newly bba graduate,2,NOT
feminazi what about the pay gap women make c for every dollar a man makes you racist pig me the wage gap oh yeah just lets ask all the men who were on the titanic what they think about that oh wait,6,ABU
the gender wage gap has always been there thats because housewives do not earn any money evolution wants it that way,2,NOT
so its not a wage gap its just different life choices atleast they actually tried to explain why its happening compared to other feminists,2,NOT
nothing is funnier and more depressing than the men who reject this,2,NOT
thank god someone is correcting the liberals,2,NOT
all the feminists disliked the video but they all know that the gender pay gap is bs so they didnt try to defend it,2,NOT
amazing to see there are still people who get triggered by facts this dinosaur is extinct the pay gap doesnt exist when employers pay equal dollars per unit of outcome there is no such thing as a pay gap move on to our next problem please next are there fairies in the garden,3,NOT
its an earnings gap not a wage gap and its not because of gender,2,NOT
if women make less money than men does that mean you get paid less than your male counterparts well if you say you dont get paid differently shouldnt you have said most women,2,NOT
interesting i just felt unconfortable with this american vocal fry at the end of almost every phrase,2,NOT
i almost forgot vox is a leftwing media thanks for reminding me,2,NOT
it doesnt exist,1,NOT
the likes on this video speak for itself,2,NOT
the wage gap is just the average meaning its a generalization of the who earns more money key word is earns first of all women work more low paying jobs its not sexist if a women chose to be a nurse and not a engineer nothing is stopping them from choosing to be an engineer in fact they are helped into it by affirmative action if a woman does become an engineer and works less hours it isnt sexist if she is working in a lower paying field like mechanical not civil it is not sexist nothing is holding women back they just dont value money as much as most men they usually prefer a job with more stability rather than a private business if a man is a doctor and a woman is earning less as a nurse they made different life choices it isnt a super natural invisible entity called patriarchy its free choice,2,NOT
be thankful you get money,2,NOT
people miss the gender,2,NOT
the easiest way to think about debunking the wage gap is this way if women really are paid less why dont certain businesses just hire women so they can save more money in employee salary,2,NOT
who the hell is making over k one year out of school,2,NOT
except that the gender wage gap study showed that men work  more hours than women meaning that the baseline difference is actually ,2,NOT
if the wage gap were real same jobs and responsibilities wouldnt companies would hire an all female staff and save thousands of dollars,3,NOT
thank you for not jumping to the conclusion that it is discrimination or oppression like sjwsthe wage gap in specific careers really boils down to flexibility in hoursand women focusing on children is often the result of interplay between couples or lack of couples a lot of mothers would rather be the primary caregiver rather than the father it does not mean that the men are lazy how dare those dads not raise kids more or the mothers are lazy how dare those moms focus on the easy task of raising kids of instead of nonchild care chores and work its just their preferences,3,NOT
so it turns out vox is actually retarded,5,ABU
the fact that women are worried about that or men for that matter is showing that no one seems to be able to look beyond the scam of the monetary system and swallow it like sweet cake instead of questioning this malevolent system governments are happy with these kinds of debates that means their product still works,2,NOT
shut up the wage gap doesnt exist if u put ugly woman in video does not mean it exist,3,NOT
how can you close something that doesnt even exist,2,NOT
the thing people miss about the wage gap is that it doesnt exist,3,NOT
i wish we would call women and females on their crap like we call black people on their crap just saying,5,ABU
i miss the gender wage gap too good ol days,3,NOT
men have to deal with more problems,3,NOT
doesnt this mean that there really isnt a wage gap in the sense that its not a gendered bias towards men in the workforce its just that traditionally women spend more time in the home thus redirecting their efforts towards emotional gain instead of financial gain,2,NOT
it should be called an earnings gap not a wage gap then,2,NOT
men generally have to work in a less comfortable environment have fewer days off have more workplace related injuries and spend  more time working and women are going to complain that they arent getting paid the same smh,2,NOT
its plainly illegal in the modern world uk and us for example to pay a woman less for the same amount of work if its happening she needs to sue otherwise nothing can be done now that feminists have invested billions and a holiday in this total non issue will they consider discussing how men are  of workplace deaths and suicides oh yeah thats right theyre feminists and they do not care about men at all even to the point of manufacturing issues for attention right now women in the west can either work like any man or become a housewife and have her husband pay for everything then possibly divorce and get half his cash meanwhile men in the west like all of history must work or else they are less then trash feminists have no plan on correcting this huge imbalance and in fact will work to keep it in place,3,NOT
its not about gender its about what job your getting im not getting all defensive but your talking bs men choose higher paying jobs and more working time which leads to higher pay,3,NOT
i cant focus because of her annoying voice,2,NOT
almost a good and balanced report but your premise still expects society to fix the choices which women make voluntarily which is more important childrearing or making money why is money the only measure of a successful life and the only way in which feminists feel that a womens worth should be measured what about happiness and fulfilment and family many women do and always will put these aspects of life ahead of making money this will never change and therefore the wagegap read earnings gap will never disappear,2,NOT
you mean an earnings gap pay gap wage gap is misleading and close to intellectual dishonest also sticking to the premises that the earnings gap is bad for women is odd since you dont really explain why its bad,2,NOT
 ice cream taster and blimp pilot sound like theyd be awesome careers,1,NOT
if the gender wage gap exist then why arent companys replacing men with women,2,NOT
how about for the account of worked hours overwork i dont believe the wagegap is all that real the only diffrence is that woman tend to negociate less but if someone holds the exact same position in the same placew with the exact same hours youll see the wagegap is none exsistend the only diffrence is though how you willl negociate,2,NOT
if you want to put a quick stop to the gender earnings gap you ought to immediately and completely free up the markets and allow capitalism to thrive if a business pays people any less than they deserve that person leaves their job whenever possible to get better benefits somewhere else you pay a person too much your competitors can run more efficiently than you then and top your profits you might worry that structural sexism would throw a wrench in this system not to worry market forces are very robust against bigotry because again the company that pays its employees based exactly on how hard they work will outcompete and outemploy startups from locally to internationally the worst thing you can possibly do to exacerbate an earnings gap is to give subsidies to certain corporations and make unions and employment restrictions if a ceo entrepreneur worker or business as a whole earns money from subsidies welfare or union dues all of which are illegal to not contribute to these funds are socializedforcefully taken from citizens they have no reason to pay their employees fairly or price products fairly they dont need to work hard at all to earn this perverted capital yet it seems so many who decry this gap are more interested in collectivist egalitarian ownership of wages rather than allowing people basic property rights and the ability to get employed where they want to youll compromise against actual solutions towards the gap every single time which demonstrates you really dont care about this issue at all,2,NOT
this video is trying to prove the wage gap exists by saying wage gap over and over again while at the same time explaining what anyone with more than a double digit iq has been saying an earnings gap the video is explaining in a nutshell women couldnt work as much because their schedules dont fit the job therefore there isnt a wage gap they are simply working less and earning less the men made more money because they worked more that isnt a wage gap no one is slashing cents off of your dollar youre simply not earning the dollar stop self validating your ridiculous feminist agenda with utter bullshit even when youre explaining something else you delude yourself into believing that you are instead justifying a conspiracy if i call it a wage gap enough times people will believe it,5,ABU
people dont realize that the only form of government with no wage gap is communismand even thats a bit of a stretch lol,2,NOT
thank god someone knows how to give a compelling argument with factsunlike tyt if they had the same topic it would just be hurrr durrrr gender gap hurrr durrrr equality,3,NOT
there should be some hidden numbers too with waitresseswaiters getting tips,2,NOT
lefty propaganda as always,2,NOT
the c in the dollar figure is a worthless raw figure it doesnt ake into account hours danger unpleasant working conditions or anything else that might affect pay any discussion that didnt start from that knowledge is worthless,2,NOT
blimp pilot and lion tamer  wtf xd,2,NOT
the wage gap and the glass ceiling are not real,3,NOT
so basically there is no wage gap but theres an earnings gap which is not caused by inequality or discrimination but rather by the different choices men and women make now can the social justice virtue signallers stop whining about it,2,NOT
for the most part up until this point i didnt even respect vox as a credible media outlet i saw this video and decided to watch it because i think its important to listen to differing opinions even if you disagree with them let me just say this video is extremely well done i personally believe in all of my research into the subject that i believe that there is a wage gap but all but about  can be attributed to lifestyle choices vox you guys knocked this one out of the park and i sincerely appreciate the neutrality shown in displaying the facts the wage gap exists but it is not  cents on the dollar b,2,NOT
vox is so cute lol they think this is true just because they used cute pictures,2,NOT
vox stop putting psychological warfare you suck,5,ABU
vox taking a non biased look at a controversial issue and going against the usual liberal viewpoint keep it up,2,NOT
but why not work towards more equal division of labor in childcare obviously theres no institutional way to do that but it seems much more effective than flexibility in hours that isnt even feasible in many fields,2,NOT
absolutely zero talk of hours worked and life choices,2,NOT
all women likes to find ways  complain about mens,3,NOT
lmao  min vid which said literally nothing,2,NOT
so women do more work at home and get paid less so are men supposed to be breadwinners or homemakers you can have one or the other not both thats just kinda how equality works,2,NOT
so they should compare men who take on the majority of house hold and child responsibilities and women to compare to see how that sizes up because this seems to be much more of a cultural structure thing than an actual pay thing,2,NOT
wait a secondice cream tasting is a job sign me up,1,NOT
its honestly comforting to see progress being made warms my heart,2,NOT
like trump said when women can do the same or a better job than men  then they can get paid the same women should stick to what they can do like housework and providing the males with offspring and making sandwhiches,5,ABU
see its not discrimination or misogyny its a functional problem,3,NOT
vox is a fake news propaganda machine  you should not be showing up in my feed youtube is not for mainstream media,2,NOT
fcking vocal fry,3,NOT
im a greedy person so i will hire women because apparently i could pay them lower that their male counterparts makes sense huh,3,NOT
i reported this video it is much to misogynistic this is evil and i demand it be taken down,3,NOT
tell me one company that pays men more than women for the same task,2,NOT
the wage gap is created by the manipulation of statistics earnings by gender thus men will always show earning more because bill gates the worlds st trillionaire and sam walton jr owner of walmart are men proponentspropogandanists of the wage gap imply that women working the same jobs and same hours make less money  which would be a violation of state and federal labor laws no company pays women less based on gender women get paid less for working less hours while men get paid more for working overtime vox intentionally omitted the fact that men work most of the overtime to compensate for their wives who opt to stay home to be with their children,2,NOT
typical vox leaves out numbers that actually count anyways who would pay someone the same as someone else if they cant even work at the same level,2,NOT
this is a great and much needed video but we should make working times more flexible just to shrink the wage gap but instead to help a lot of peoples mental health as jobs with long working hours are largely responsible for stuff like depression anxiety and so on so we should be focusing more on that as it will also help shrink the wage gap as well,2,NOT
if i was a company owner and could pay women  less it would be a total taco fest,3,NOT
 feminists hate math,5,ABU
vocal fry argh,2,NOT
doesnt exist saved you  minutes,3,NOT
song at the end,1,NOT
the answer is quite simple dont have kids,2,NOT
if women are paid less than men then why do business even hire men in the first place companies will want to minimize their production costs so why would they choose one source that costs more than the other for equal work id say theres more to this story also theres a bunch of jobs that are always highlighted where men get paid more where do women get paid more,2,NOT
instead of just blaming men this video actually goes in depth of why the figure exists and ways to remedy it if feminists were more like this i wouldnt have a problem with them,5,ABU
my mom simply stays home and actually takes her of her kids kids need a lot of attention but also restrictions to develop properly women are just designed to care for their kids breasts i dont want to say that women shouldnt be able to work but if they decide for a kid they should be able to invest time into their kids and not be forced to put them in a crche many people have problem with the teenagers today and i think a partial reason for that is parents spending less time parenting im  diligent and smart and i think part of that is because my mom set me rules because thats what a kid needs before it is able to realize itself that watching tv all day is a bad idea hrmusahrm,5,ABU
her thinking that a venture capitalist or wall st bankers hours are  sums up the problem lol business is a dog eat dog world no one thats set on working  is going to make near as much as those willing to work more,2,NOT
until women start preferring cute men who make substantially less money than they do nothing will change men work longer and harder to make more money because it gets them more access to more pretty women,2,NOT
in the coming years i wonder how society will account for the emerging trans community in these economic models will it fix the issues or make them worst,2,NOT
waring only caps fot rest you dumb mohterfucker dont you know its againts the law to pay someone less for their gender and pepole have diffrent pay for less and more experince its called new at job vs pro workersmh dude,6,ABU
feminist logic  there is a huge gender pay gap i have a gender studies degree and i still dont get paid more than a male programmer even though both of us are bachelors degree holders,3,NOT
wage gap is a myth if men and women have the same job title the same duties or work load and work the same hour how could they get payed less it would be discrimination which is a very straight forward lawsuit which no employer would gamble  if the pay gap was so distant why are they paying men more when they could save millions of dollars a year in big corporations and thousands in smaller business ,2,NOT
i admit this is confusing as hell what i got from it was women cant work the same hours men can so they earn less so there is a earn gap and not a wage gap,2,NOT
its not a pay gap its an earning gap,2,NOT
i really hope once women earn more than men like theyre doing better in school all the feminists start fighting for mens rights to earning and doing the same in education feminism is all about equality after all,2,NOT
so women and men that work the same positions get paid the same oh okay so there isnt a gender gap its an earnings gap,2,NOT
why havent they entered the argument of availability its just the ability on coming in on days off and the ability to do longer hours,2,NOT
i thought it was c or was it c apparently its c pick one already you cant have a stat and not stick to it,2,NOT
theres a pay gap between each person,2,NOT
my mom had a solution for my dad not pulling his weight around the house she stop doing laundry and got a job so my dad became a stay at home dad,1,NOT
so basically this says the problem revolves around taking care of children which women are biologically wired to be more inclined to do therefore theyre trading their job and thus their pay for their children a choice they decided to make if you work less you should get paid less so employers arent to blame if taking care of her children makes a woman happier then she should take care of her children in the end the wage gap is caused by biological processes that arent inherently good or bad which we cant control this means that the wage gap exists but isnt a problem,3,NOT
the thing is women and men would earn the same if they are in the same job and have the same credentials the so called wage gape is comparing the average earning of men to women so there really isnt any problem with that,2,NOT
i think you glazed over the fact that men dont share the parental responsibilitiesunpaid childcare house that women work that really seems to be the bigger issue,1,NOT
what feminists see is the percentage but people with a sense of logic see the actual implications of the data that provide the percentage women are more likely to choose jobs that pay less and they are more likely to take more time off through maternity leave this results in a lower pay yes not all women choose lower paying jobs and yes not all women get pregnant which impedes their pay but some do which is what changes their pay and by extension the averages that are used to receive the data for the percentage,2,NOT
 venture capitalist  job lol get the fck out of here this woman doesnt know what shes talking about,5,ABU
its against the law to pay different wages for the same job based on gender its an income gap because women take more time off for child rearing,2,NOT
the issue is wage transparency in work places obfuscating pay impacts all groups this is because inevitably differences would be driven by the negotiation phase of hiring which ever group is better at this will be able to edge ahead for doing the exact same thing this is why all your business dots perform the worse,2,NOT
i call bs on  women were making  less is incorrect k is actually  of k which means women were making  less on the other hand im wondering if the numbers were simply very badly made up k is exactly  more than k exactly the odds that numbers come out that precise in statistics from random studies involving dollar amounts from many people are incredibly low so either the numbers are made up or they are very grossly rounded that said ill give them the benefit of the doubt and say they dont understand simple math they saw k is  more than k and assumed the reverse phrasing would be correct two is  more than one but one is only  less than two,2,NOT
i can agree that flexible hours would help however who stays home with the kids is a decision couples make maybe women need to insist on working as many hours in their jobs as their husbands additionally you broke this down into  simple categories  which didnt even go into trade jobs or labor jobs rather than specific jobs an example oncologists and neurosurgeons or any surgeon is going to make more money by far than a general physician some one with a social science degree who goes into business is going to earn less money than a person with a degree in economics or straight up business this is because more people go into the field of social science than business hours worked is another factor the more hours you work  even on a salary job the more likely  all other things being equal that you will either get a raise or a promotion it also seems that men are more likely to ask for a raise than women or take the risk of leaving one job for another there are a lot of things which play into the earnings gap and it is an earnings gap not a wage gap same job worked same hours same number of years yields a far smaller or even nearly zero difference in pay it is imo disingenuous to call this a  wage gap,2,NOT
one reason is agreeableness when my dad wanted more money for his work he demanded a raise when my mom wanted more she passively waited for them to give her a raise,2,NOT
well this made me dumber,2,NOT
i mean ok  is better than it used to be but its still quite a difference idk,1,NOT
men work longer case closed,2,NOT
you guys make great informative videos,2,NOT
alot of people miss the fact that this was debunked in the s,2,NOT
let the women work stay home dads are the new thing xd,2,NOT
i feel like you have missed a critical point to the wage gap fallacy this is the fact that if you simply aggregate all of the data for full time mens and womens salaries then you are not taking into account that certain careers pay less than others and there are disproportionate amounts of certain genders working in certain fields for example lets take teaching and compare that to construction work women are the overwhelming majority of teachers in most countries still to this day and yet teaching in most countries is considered a low pay job on the other hand construction work pays very well in most first world countries and is dominated by males you can make many other comparisons such as nurses vs doctors or retail service assistants vs research scientists and you will come up with similar results now the important question is why less women are choosing the higher paying career paths to this there is not a clear answer but studies suggest that women prefer jobs that involve more social interaction there are other factors such as strict fitness requirements for certain high paying labourintensive jobs like construction however it is intellectually dishonest to ignore these facts just because we dont completely understand the underlying reasons behind them we need to be focusing on how to get more male teachers and female construction workers if you really want to close this gap but im not so sure thats even the right approach if women want to work in a field that pays less then why should we tell them they cant what about freedom for women to choose their career and is it wrong that teaching should pay less than research science these are far more tricky to answer and no one seems to want to address these questions at all on this channel,1,NOT
question about the math at  k is roughly  of k so women earn  less right,1,NOT
jesus christ some people are actually completely ignorant the wage gap is real and this video provides an insight into why this gap exists yes women earn less but this video talks about the choices women take regarding dealing with children and what career they choose it doesnt blame anyone in fact its one of the few videos about the wage gap that actually gives a clear solution or advice at the very least to help guide to less of a wage gap but people still feel the need to not watch the video and spam with wage gap doesnt exist,1,NOT
i am ashamed that this is what my generation is becoming the entitlement is unreal,1,NOT
women take on a disproportionate amount of child rearing because that is an aspect of human nature nothing wrong with that at all,2,NOT
this is coming from vox a left leaning channel keep that in mind,2,NOT
a lot of people in the comments seem to be missing two things  just because something is illegal doesnt mean it cant happen  what job we end up in is a result of lots of factors not all of which are under our control its not just about choice,1,NOT
whoa surprisingly great job vox,1,NOT
wow  i did not expect to see a rational examination of this issue from vox pleasantly surprised to see the wage gap isnt because of the sexist patriarchy as some would have us believe,2,NOT
guys this video definitely didnt say there wasnt a wage gap,1,NOT
just out of curiosity i wonder what the wage gap is like for jobs involving a lot of physical labor ,2,NOT
yes  means that theyre earning  less you cant even read off of a script you silly cat,2,NOT
why do you say we need to close the wage gap when you acknowledge they earn less because of life choices children ie there is no earnings gap also looking at the earnings of mba grads from a single ivy league school is ridiculous,2,NOT
i know whats really right there only to genders,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap  it doesnt exist,3,NOT
this video made me want to smash my head against a wall she just tried to over complicate the fact that the statistics about wage gaps between men and women arent accurate and dont take into account the different variables and the type of jobs worked i wish feminist would use their energy more constructively in helping rd world women whom are  of  wives,3,NOT
i went to a very good high school but it was soooo politically biased my junior english teacher and history teacher in high school were and are best friends extremely intelligent women and now great mothers but they were also the type of feminists to project any information that made them mad even if it wasnt entirely true the wage gap misconception was definitely the most glaring of those offenses by teaching all of their students this misconception both my history class and english class got into debates about feminism also because it was relevant to the curriculum and people used this wage gap as their base of support that showed the inequality among men and women in the workplace today in the process my school basically trained a bunch of smart kids to not think critically and just assume statistics were true or false based on if it agrees with their political views or not clearly this video proves that the wage gap many of my friends and teachers had in mind is not real but is in the form of a much more reasonable statistic if one was to actually look further into the data instead of getting excited about the it thinking it is true and then ignoring the critical thinking process because they want the information to be true all because it supports their cause while i do believe that there should be equality in the workplace there is no way that we can ignore what is actually causing much of the inequality in average pay to sum up this huge comment thank you vox and everyone involved with this video for creating a piece related to feminism with good critical and analytical thinking skills instead of spewing incredibly biased and false feminist stories while you made a lot of feminists look bad for yelling wrong information at people for so long you also made the movement look much better because you acknowledged as a very feminist channel that something many feminists believe is true is not thanks again,3,NOT
this video makes the assumption that women being stay at home mums is going to continue to be the norm and that work hours should work around them how about we change this norm which inherently chooses to oppresses women maybe that should be a message of the video continued increase in women not staying at home to take care of kids and less kids all together,1,NOT
wouldnt companies only just hire women if they could pay them less than men,2,NOT
this is really interesting i didnt think about how job flexibility could have a big impact on how much work you can do,1,NOT
nice video glad to seem some wider analysis on this issue rather than just complaining about the outcome,2,NOT
good thing im self employed,1,NOT
or if u wantb a mother u cld b a mother  ,1,NOT
cant feminists just start their own all female companies hiring only womenthe anti male biased laws would totally allow that and the government would hand them tons of tax money too,2,NOT
im brain dead now,2,NOT
what vox actually making sense am i being punked almost made me subscribe for a second who is this girl i wanna follow her,2,NOT
so youre saying the wage gap is the result of the free choices of men and women well duh,2,NOT
bitchy jewish girl voice theres going to be some bullshit here,6,ABU
the pay gap is even lower and almost non existent in countries with better maternity leave pay than the us that helps bring the average pay of those women up while theyre having kids,1,NOT
question whats with the obsession of ending the wage gap as the video outlined its not that women are getting paid less for the same work and instead its more that theyre doing less work or working in lower paying fields this is the outcome of those womens choices they chose to go into that lower paying jobfield and they chose to work less hours so why does it matter why do we have to try and force changes just so the government can look at national earnings of the sexes and see that theyre balanced theres no inherent value to that,2,NOT
in a nutshell dont have children,2,NOT
or we could pay manly jobs less and womanly jobs more like how come teachers and nurses get paid peanuts compared to what businessmen or bankers earn,1,NOT
my mother has  children works full time and has been the number one salesman in her company for the last several years she sells the most product in the entire company and yet she is still payed less than some of the men in her company who sell less product per year explain,2,NOT
notice how they simply say average earnings and dont take into account that many women by their free will raise families and take off time from work take on average work less hours than men and other factors its funny how feminists of today get so angry about some womens choices but not others i thought they were all for that,3,NOT
wait im confused so ur admitting that the wage gap is only the average of all women and all men and its not the same job whats ur issue then,2,NOT
the wage gap was debunked way back in the seventies and thats not to mention how much extra support women get in terms of scholarships and grants for their education that men have little to no access to,2,NOT
there is now wage gap this is just more feminist propaganda,5,ABU
men get more money cuz women expect them to pay for dinner,3,NOT
theres no problem here the women only earn less on average because of decisions they make for themselves to say that there is a problem is more sexist than claiming theres a wage gap because youre saying women should be working the higher paying jobs like the men instead of doing what they want,3,NOT
so the end of the video basically says that the entire world should change the way it does things so that women end up with the same amount of money    buahahahahahaa,3,NOT
i thought this might add more credibility if typed by a woman there is no wage gap theres an earnings gap based on career choices women make paying two people different wages based on gender is illegal if youve been compensated unfairly dont take off an hour at work contact the labor board because laws exist to protect you among millennials the highest paid demographic are single females because millennial women are earning way more college degrees than men and are thus getting better paying jobs mostly because public school education favors females speaking of stem half the medical students and the vast majority of biology students are female last time i checked medicine and biology are sciences dont believe the feminist propaganda perpetuated by womens studies courses its not based on reality ok definitely my last post on here,3,NOT
so the main point they try to drive home here is jobs should allow schedule change more freely because of women,2,NOT
factually correct  not really,2,NOT
maybe men are just better than women at providing,3,NOT
overtime weekends afterhour calls hazard pay flex time negotiating pay raises desire for pay raises over gaining benefits,2,NOT
what about all the  woman who have earned more than their male counterpart when variables are identical,2,NOT
amazing just impenetrable faith can we list feminism as a religion already,3,NOT
the kid factor is a large part of it in fact it is worth separating women with kids and women without kids in terms of the wage gap,2,NOT
good video i did not expect a description of reality i was on high alert for pandering and misinformation and was pleasantly surprised though i will say until women prefer men who stay home and find value in homelife there will continue to be disproportionate homework responsibility disparities hypergamy exists cross culturally and racially and is one of the contributing factors that men for better or worse place a higher importance on working all the timebeing a provider to attract a mate  poise themselves for a family,2,NOT
im surprised its very hard to make a  minute long video on something that doesnt exist,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist at all so,3,NOT
is thats its fake  second video,2,NOT
i saw vox and automatically clicked dislike before watching had to go back and change that afterwards,2,NOT
there is no gender pay gap because gender is a lie,3,NOT
women want kids you arent going to change society oh boo hoo youre not earning as much money as men men are dieing doing the hard work like cleaning sewers and building bridges,3,NOT
i have a feeling that the larger gender pay gap in business than in other industries has to do with risk tolerance i dont believe their hypothesis that it has to do with flexibility of work hours in business markets tend to close at usual hours whereas in tech you gotta be constantly on call in case something goes wrong,2,NOT
i am not a feminist and i actually really liked this video i think the best part was you gave a somewhat practical solution to a practical problem i wish more left leaning progressives would do that because i might actually join them at that point the biggest problem with progressivism is that their best answer to problems usually revolves around cultural change or societal change society and culture are peoples responses to the world around them its not just a dial you can turn to your liking the only real way you can change a culture or society is by forcing people against their will to believe your ideology which historically is best done through a freedomless totalitarian government like stalin or hitler,3,NOT
i say its time for the government to implement a no gender left behind program communists have such a destructive perception of equality,2,NOT
that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
how much do you want to bet  of dislikes on this are but hurt feminists and the other  are white knights who have never been layed,3,NOT
if women want  equality they have to start working in the sewers be the one picking up trash build houses and work on oil rigs they cant just take jobs were they are leaders of big companies and countries its not all sunshine and roses over at the male department,2,NOT
what is it with the dislikes,1,NOT
hits muh wage gap button the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not account for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,2,NOT
as long as everyone is being payed fairely for their job why do you want to close the medium pay gap,2,NOT
 factually correct lul wat,2,NOT
the reason women often do more chores help kids esc is because males often go to work more this simply has to do with the fact that women on average enjoy being with their kids more meaning that a women is more likely to stay at home peace,2,NOT
women do it to their self i can tell just by going to college for several of years in the software programming and tech classes women are nearly non existent while software development is one of the highest paying jobs out there most classes will average like  women out of a  people filled class room and thats even considering that more women are actually in the tech field compared to  years ago the most women ive had in one of my classes was  but even that was a database class that can branch from a general business degree go even into health care and majority of women youll hear are going to be a nurse i dont know if its insecurities or what but i dont think people can blame wage gap when it seems most are purposely going for lower paying jobs instead of trying to become a doctor,2,NOT
because of the amount of money they earn they literally assume its because theyre a woman,2,NOT
video summary a lack of flexibility can cause a wage gap in certain roles why this is bullshit blame men for working under shittier conditions than most women so that their families wont have to work as much then call it unfair to the women ha welcome to  everybody edit oops actually  even better,2,NOT
the gap is freaking stupid bosses dont just say oh shes a girl yep lets lower her wage they dont say that its just that women get worker jobsare worse at doing them,3,NOT
which men and women earns k out of business lmao wtf,2,NOT
you didnt even mention race and ethnicity those affect the gap too,1,NOT
watch but muh wage gap,2,NOT
youre goal is to replace a meaningless wage gap by having companies have more flexible hours which is detremintal to buisness,2,NOT
welp looks like we need more abortions a feminist would say,2,NOT
we need more women lion tamers,2,NOT
its almost like human beings make individual choices are arent just numbers on a spreadsheet gasp,2,NOT
the wage gap is probably due to kids women typically work less hours to care for kids afterwards they may put more effort into the workplace,2,NOT
youll get paid the same if you do just as good of a job,2,NOT
well i just dont want to do they type of jobs that pay a lot this is my choice it was not forced on me and a lot of women i know like doing theses things for their kids and do not mind men working more to make the money,2,NOT
correction earnings gap,2,NOT
do i hear the shoeonhead loop,1,NOT
if there really is a wage gap based on a patriarchy then all greedy business owners have to do is fire all of their male workers and only hire women since they can pay them less thats how this works right,2,NOT
a big issue that is often missed every company ive ever worked for has had many women who have refused promotions because the male spouse was self employed ie plumbers electricians etc the main goal was more about providing benefits like health and retirement that a selfemployed spouse could not provide,1,NOT
women get paid less then men so why dont employers only employ women and save money or does it come down to skillsets,2,NOT
as a freemarket libertarian who has been arguing against the popular perspective on the wage gap i can say that i am very happy with this explanation review and video relating to the problem,1,NOT
or maybe just maybe it doesnt exist,2,NOT
so if women would just stop having kids and work a little bit harder we dont have to listen to them complain that theyre lazy and they like having kids and staying at home if my wife wanted to go to work and work long hours while i stay at home with the kids i would gladly make less money than a woman does,2,NOT
dislikes  neurotic feminist sjws,5,ABU
 its a fact that a wage gap exists have they done any research on the supposed wage gap that had been disproven you could say  ah its all men that have disproven it ahhhhhh oppression well one of the first people to disprove this wage gap was a woman reply with your thoughts on this bullshit,3,NOT
men risk more and work more hours they earn more because of that there is no reasonable or moral reason to force emoloyers pay the same to women who work less and take less risks,2,NOT
i thought this was gunna be a bunch of liberal propaganda and disliked before watching but you earned a like thanks for the video,2,NOT
im sorry but i cant stand her voice ,2,NOT
im sorry who are these people making k  year out of business school,1,NOT
this is the most insidiously mysandristic wage gap video on youtube it is good propaganda though it disguises false premise as hard fact and sells antimale bigotry as profemale progressiveness nice job vox this is your worst video so far,2,NOT
women should take on a disproportionate role in the household they should also teach their daughters to do likewise,5,ABU
you cant compare self employed men and women because men are more likely to take risks its proven,2,NOT
it also doesnt take into account the stem jobs like construction and things of the hard labor that men usually do now it has nothing to do with the thought that one sex is stronger than the other but more to the fact that women dont usually take those jobs also the fact that scientifically men are usually more competitive and will take longer hours,2,NOT
okey  the newest statistic is  years old  if women do more work with the kids on average when men do more hours work in work place on average im happy to see how women like if swap those around  if individual gets more work done with same qualifications in the same time as another do you pay them the same although their worth different amounts of work and if or if not why thats just the start of the problems within this propaganda i would gladly discuss this further,2,NOT
translation men and women earn the same for equal work but we still need to fight the wage gap thanks vox,2,NOT
its againest the law to pay someone more if they do the same thing,1,NOT
man this subject is so stale these days,1,NOT
it seems like a cultural shift thats just going to iron out after a while thats alright,2,NOT
vox is horrible youre not smart vox just get to the point dont try to beat around the bush of the fact that theres no wage gap,2,NOT

finally feminists are actually addressing this issue,3,NOT
women are biologically inclined to be more maternal we should not need a chart to tell us this,2,NOT
women take on a disproportionate share of child rearing duties because they want to most of the time i took maternity leave with both my kids my husband didnt i have different hours so i can pick up my kids and do after school activities with them i want to be involved and i know the trade off is my career thats fine its just a choice of prioritization you cant have it both ways climb the corporate ladder get higher education put in the additional time and work to get promoted all while taking time off for personal life,2,NOT
 women work less hours on average  women are less likely to ask for a raise this explains the wage gap within same occupations,2,NOT
the whole thing is people missing the word earnings gap not wage gap,2,NOT
great video keep it up vox,1,NOT
where shoeoneheads wage gap button when you need it,2,NOT
this is basically the video men think that they are better than women but really women are supperior to men all men are sexist like wtf is your logic,3,NOT
i dont think most people commenting here watched the video they seem to be upset even though they agree with what was said in the video,2,NOT
its not a wage gap its a earnage gap men earn more than women on average they are not just given more money,2,NOT
what people think about the gender wage gap myth,2,NOT
females get paid way more than they shouldthey are worth about a quarter of men,6,ABU
dat vocal fry though,2,NOT
you would think that if the gender pay gap was nationwide discrimination preachers of it would be able to point out numerous individual instances of discrimination after all you cant have a true generalization without sample members fitting in with the general statement look up the gender pay gap for basically any other country than america its still there that suggests it has more to do with worldwide culture and less to do with the us being a sexist patriarchy,2,NOT
where the feminists at,2,NOT
i actually think this is a fair argument at least more than the black and white yes it does exist or no it doesnt exist arguments i think what it boils down to is that a lot of businesses have not evolved to st century standards there was a simpler time when most people got up around the same time worked roughly around the same time and went to bed around the same time that isnt true anymore so a lot of business structures need to change which is a far better solution than simply giving certain people more money especially if they do less work,1,NOT
for all the hate people give social libertarians they have made liberal sjws back way off on the stridency of their discrimination claim regarding the wage gap now instead of a patriarchal conspiracy we just get a video complaining that women get to play with the kids more and have a more balanced lifestyle for a tiny bit less money progress towards the truth is slow but it appears to be real,2,NOT
thank god someone stating their sources in the description,1,NOT
when a lot of men want a raise and ask for it they get it when a lot of women want a raise they are too afraid to ask for it and get stuck with what they have this doesnt apply to everyone obviously but it does affect the wage gap,2,NOT
these statistics are completely irrelevant if you dont consider time worked or what type of work done,1,NOT
also women look for men who make more than them a men doesnt care what a women does he just wants her to be pretty so there is an incentive for men to work harder in higher paying jobs,2,NOT
that motherfcking vocal fry my body will never recover from all this ear bleeding jokes aside wage gap is as inexistent as your brain my dear,5,ABU
so to fix it all we have to do is stop having kids right that way men and women can be exactly the same,2,NOT
insert wage gap button here the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not account for different job position hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,2,NOT
if a discriminatory based gender wage gap existed then companies would only hire female workers to save money but we do not see this there are many studies that prove that the gender wage gap in fact does not exist all else constant,3,NOT
there is no wage gapthere are only fat lazy femenists who think they are the center of the world,5,ABU
women and men are different both have different duties to each their own men go to work whereas women stay at home and take care of the children stay single or have no child if you want the same wage as men id be the richest just by hiring lowwage middle age women for my business,2,NOT
money isnt everything id rrather have a nice life than being filthy rich,1,NOT
yes women take on more household duties than manbecause they want to,3,NOT
another thing you miss is that women tend to choose worse paing jobs,3,NOT
no single study can correctly identify the real gap which is barely recognizable,2,NOT
five hours websites government websites job workplace statistics motivational wage seminars and learning about economics vox has proven they cant even get basic journalism right to prove a theory to be correct you have to research it to be false and harshly this is the scientific method id like this to be correct however if your numbers experiment yields unfair able results guess what it isnt real its a earnings gap and it isnt sexist its about individual choices and the core belief of equal opportunity not equality of outcome if you stick with a narrative over the evidence youre an ideological individual,3,NOT
why would someone hire men if women can do it for less checkmate buddhists monks,3,NOT
a wagegap as described by contemporary feminists doesnt exist end of conversation,3,NOT
they miss that it dosnt exists,3,NOT
just take away choice and make women work long hours with no time off for children the wage gap will be lower thats all that matters unless you care about people,3,NOT
too bad sjw shouldve been born a man,3,NOT
my home was pretty much the opposite my mum made the most money and worked two jobs while my dad worked at home made less money and looked after my brother and i,1,NOT

this is in bad taste,2,NOT
there is something very wrong with you,3,NOT
wtf this video doesent agree with me the wage gap is clearly a myth and a huge lie made by idiot feminists  is clearly caused by the sexist men and patriarchy im triggered disliked and unsubbed,3,NOT
guys how does this sound mandatory paid maternity and paternity leaves gasp,1,NOT
wage gap is false and invalid if it really existed then employers would employ women wouldnt they,2,NOT
great video vox this is why i subscribed,1,NOT
way more honest than the other wage gap vdeo of yours and better putted together way to go,1,NOT
anyone ever tought about the fact that men on average are just better in business,3,NOT
i as a male actually pay more to renew my license ever year than a woman does solely due to the fact that i am a male this is because there have been more males involved in accidents than females so i pay the higherrisk fees i have yet to see anyone raise a fuss about this,1,NOT
there is no fuckimg sexism related to this because for the same and hours worked men and women earn the same,1,NOT
cuz most women arent good at business but men are,3,NOT
the wage gap myth is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,2,NOT
there still seems to be a problem with conflating earnings with wages you have to look at additional working hours overtime etc to have the most accurate conclusions,1,NOT
the gender wage gap is fake wemon and men do work for different jobs that pay differently on top of the fact that sexism is an opinion and everyone is entitled to an opinion if your boss is paying you less than your coworkers then do something about it instead if complaining about it the wage gap is quite simply wemon who look at a small fraction of a problem and blows it out of proportion,2,NOT
what an annoying voice every sentence ends in a cracking sound,2,NOT
wage gap exists just on a much smaller scale an easy thing to do to fix it maternitypaternity leave,1,NOT

the wage gap does not exist before i watch this,2,NOT
sooo you breed and take time off and thats a mans fault,2,NOT
lol first  seconds and they lie,2,NOT
lots of people didnt actually watch the video did they,1,NOT
theyre missing that it doesnt exist,2,NOT
im actually surprised about how well made the video is my only question is why is this a problem the results are clearly because of life choices which women make so why do we need to close the wage gap at all,1,NOT
this vid was interesting for the first minute then all i heard was blah blah blah,2,NOT
so the wage gap exist but not because the world is sexist or patriarchal but because women are usually the one who takes care of the childrens and that effect the wage  someone please tell that to those sjw liberals and fake feminist who hate men,2,NOT
once again kids are the problem,2,NOT
its not so much a wage gap as an earnings gap this video does a great job explaining how discrimination doesnt really play into the gap,1,NOT
and make it so men are able to and feel more obligation to share the home and parenting workload with their partners,1,NOT
women take on the bulk of child care duties because they are better at them than men and because raising children is more important than any other job,2,NOT
milton friedman put it best when governments mandate equal pay laws you make it free for the chauvinists to discriminate a system in which there is no mandated equal pay there is a very visible cost to be discriminatory so how might we best address the gender wage gap if it exists let the chauvinists feel the pain in their pocket books certainly dont make it free for them to be nasty asses,2,NOT
i always thought women got paid more than men at least in my industry they do,1,NOT
every time i see one of these videos i cringe a little women statistically are worse at asking for a raise so many studies have been done dont blame the dads like they arent taking the kids to soccer practise or what ever,2,NOT
perhaps you should stop calling it a wage gap and call it an earnings gap and realise that its not a problem that requires fixing if theres a hole in a bucket by all means please fix it if theres a hole in a donut trying to fix it will only destroy it,1,NOT
there is no wage gap shocker,2,NOT
wow vox is finally starting to admit that the wage gap claim is a myth amazing never thought i would see this day,1,NOT
um how about instead we stop making women do all the child care and stop penalizing them for it not to mention this is not a complete picture for instance even in those jobs that have closer salaries women still did make less so wheres the explanation there how about the increased wage gap for women of color not to mention we always talk about women choosing to go into fields that make less money when really we just value the labor of women less if tons of women are doing it it must be easy so we shouldnt pay them as much,1,NOT
you guys dont have any videos about adoption,1,NOT
your graf at  isent so accurate xd,1,NOT
anyone else stunned more that people where making k  years out of business school,1,NOT
i came here ready to disagree im so glad we are finally starting to address the real issue instead of focusing on a fake one,2,NOT
i have to make another comment because with the jobs you showed making flexible hours for women  you are essentially making everyone else who are possible customers or clients of those companies businesses etc wait for women to work and do work,2,NOT
university qualifications maternity leave overtime family life these are some of the variables that the wage gap does not consider,1,NOT
this was pretty good why downvote,1,NOT
men get paid more than women because men are more likely to get maimed killed do filthy or degrading jobs or work long hours than women its a fact i am a garbage man its filthy degrading and hard work but it pays good can women do it sure of course but you never do i wonder why,2,NOT
who knew the gender which evolved to be as useful and competitive as possible turned out good at doing stuff and working hard weird right,3,NOT
why are people so against solving problems if it werent for those delusional mind my pronouns feminists then people would take these real problems more seriously,3,NOT
this was actually pretty good well reasoned out for a  minute video vox has done some pretty bad videos about similar subjects previously but this one seems like a return to form,1,NOT
so men who work with nuclear fusion should get paid less because of the boo hoos of women,2,NOT
the wage gap is more of an earnings gap which means that equality of opportunity doesnt equal equality of output,1,NOT
i appreciate that this video acknowledges that the wage gap is not caused by discrimination however it still maintains that women choosing lower paying jobs on average is a problem since when has making a choice that impact nobody but yourself been a bad thing,2,NOT
this is simply false,1,NOT
when you piss of both feminazis and meninists you know youve done something right,3,NOT
consider also as usually the job men do home are irritating painful dangerous task or seem as dirty or scary example taking down a vasp to taking down a vasp nest fixing the car painting the house fixing the house some garden cutting grass upgrading the house and helping it rise in vaule,2,NOT
earnings have you not heard of the word earnings there is an annual gap in what the two genders earn amazingly there is a very sizeable earnings gap between the female neighbour in the house next door on my left and the female neighbour in the house on my right when i learned of this i needed to be revived with smelling salts one is a  year old with  babies receiving welfare but who supplements it with a casual retail job i was disgusted to hear she doesnt earn the same as my other neighbour who is a pharmacist who also owns two stores go figure theyre the same gender for gods sake,2,NOT
finally the world is catching up with reality glad to see some research behind the statistics that have been used for almost  years to make women believe men are taking advantage of them time to face it people feminism is all based on bullshit biology is undeniable lmfao,3,NOT
people read into statistics to much me and my wife worked full time i made  more then her she worked  hours a week i worked  now the kids are grown and our income reversed she makes  more then me we both work  hours a week very typical of american familieswhy does everyone devalue women that make the decision to raise children into successful human being materialism is killing america and the rest of the world,2,NOT
vox now what i always ask my self watching these videos how is it that house and child care is considered a burden but income generation an opportunity there is no evidence that this in any way reflects actual attitudes towards both occupations in fact it is rather the opposite so why is it always preented this way,1,NOT
i still do not understand my first paid job school cleaner i earned less than the femaleshe had done the job long than me and was my mum i was  as a beekeeper i got less than most of the females because they had done the job for longer and where older as a motorbike courier in a different country there was no difference as an it technician in another country all on the same as a driller in the mines no female drillers with my companyas a traffic controller all on the same ok i have only ever been paid for the hours i work never had a salary but have also in over  years of work in  countries i have never seen a difference in pay i dont get it wherewhen do i get all this extra money that i am obviously owed as i am male,2,NOT
ok im now  sure vox isnt a satire news organization,2,NOT
lets talk about the draft gap  women died after being drafted for every  men during ww and vietnam smh lets get that number equal,2,NOT
whats this an internet gossip outlet looking at actual research i almost fell off my chair,1,NOT
this question just makes it all mess up if women earn less than men why dont companies only hire women,2,NOT
i love vox,1,NOT
i am sorry i am not able to understand something here isnt wage gap issue regarding the difference in payment for same work done we are still comparing the womens salaries to there men counterparts isnt that exactly what the problem is if the job hours are from  the women has no obligation to stay back for a meeting at  and persons other priorities like children etc cannot be criticized by people and should not affect the wages of a job which heshe are doing well,1,NOT
thats why they get paid less,2,NOT
this makes perfect sense natural market forces and job requirements affect wages,1,NOT
children isnt the only thing that skews the wage gap women chose lower paying jobs than men do,2,NOT
this video says that women choose to earn less than men therefore we need to change our jobs to be more inconvenient just so they suit women better ye totally,2,NOT
wtf is this oh wait its bla bla,2,NOT
i think we women usually pick different careers we also are tougher to be nice so negotiating is out of line,1,NOT
so you just admitted there is no wage gap my god youre stupid,3,NOT
if i owned a business i would only hire women because you can obviously pay them less think about it,2,NOT
so many feminists in the comment section supporting the feminazis at vox,2,NOT
this video basically debunked the wage gap while also still claiming that there is a wage gap what,1,NOT
this makes it sound like men are just more ambitious this wasnt a good explanation of this there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap if men were the humans that bring life into the world they would statistically earn less than women,2,NOT
the wage gap isnt reeeeeeeaaaaaalll,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap it does not exist,2,NOT
fellow liberal brethren and sistren stay out of the comments i beg of ye conservatives have flooded our safe space with triggering opposing viewpoints dont read their idiotic and problematic posts or they might just change your mind not because theyre right but because of their patriarchal control and use of sexist facts,2,NOT
another cause is that women tend to choose similar jobs and careers meanwhile men are way more diversify these creates a lot more workers that are needed in certain jobs so the competence in those jobs rise and the salary of all those professionals is reduced why women choose the same hobbies and careers the answer is easy culture inertia since religin times most religions did not allow women to do the same things that men did they could not study work in some jobs or do almost nothing more than take care of their childs that is the gap you are looking for,1,NOT
yay finally not some bullshit feminists,2,NOT
who the hell makes k,1,NOT
cherry picking at its finest,1,NOT
its almost as if everyone is their own person and makes their own choices that affects them in their own lives,1,NOT
if its true why dont employers just get female workers come on cant you see your wrong death to feminazis,5,ABU
yes lets force women to make the choices feminists want them to make,2,NOT
but whats the gap for retail or fast food jobs,1,NOT
the wage gap has been proven false multiple times,2,NOT
as a man the woman who was hired for my job before me made  more with less education and experience than me she literally made more than me for the exact same accounting job i dont think this wage gap is true youre stats are out of context of their papers thats awful science its not even science at that point nowhere do your stats talk about women choosing responsibilities or their perceived quality of life this is click bait id say stahp but it makes you waaayyy too much money and youre a woman making more than many men just by making videos based on stats i dont have to cite as you dont either,2,NOT
the video is factional and all but how could you miss the way race ability etc affect the wage gap latinas in the us make like  less than white women and nearly half of what white men make this video seems to consider white women most of all and its even reflected in the clips of working women,1,NOT
so men and women earn the same just that men work more time thus earn more,2,NOT
i have five points about the wage gap  if it were really true why woulnt companies just hire all women instead of men and make an additional  in profits for their share holders i am sure no one would complain if a company hired all women in fact it would be celebrated as a trail blazer  do we think that every plumber the vast majority of them are men by the way in new york gets paid the exact same amount for unclogging a toilet if not there is a wage gap  why is it not your responsibility to know what you are worth and negotiate what you think is fair if you get what you think you are worth there is no wage gap if you dont know or underestimate your worth it is your problem the last time i checked indentured labor is against the law so if you are not paid what you are worth it is your responsibility to find another job that pays you a fair wage  some people both men and women will accept less than the market wage in order to compensate for their lack of experience or education it is an opportunity for them to join the workforce and prove their worth this is essential for competition keeping wages in check and giving people a chance to enter their profession of choice  what are we doing about the wage gap between blacks  whites asians  nonasians vegetarians  nonvegetarians muslims  christians or any other classification of people we can think of,2,NOT
do you have any idea how work in a laboratory or in business works it seems like youve oversimplified it way too much to fit your hypothesis,1,NOT
 feminist disliked this video,2,NOT
the biggest lie by omission of the gender wage gap is that it does not take into account the fact that men work more hours than women so in other words women are getting less money for fewer hours of work which is as it should be,2,NOT
there is no wage gap rather an earing gap,1,NOT
what wage gape,1,NOT
are the comparisons in the same market is the comparison on same position within the same company,1,NOT
its simple women arent men,2,NOT
wouldnt that be a salary gap then,1,NOT
butt hurt meninists attacking everyone theyre even more annoying than the extreme feminists,2,NOT
or you idiot it actually represents different choices made by men and women on average you know that thing that becomes more and more obvious the less outside forces affect outcomes its why you idiots never talk about the scandinavian countries where the gender pay gap is most pronounced  because every single fact runs counter to your dumb narrative,3,NOT
if you read the study they misrepresented the information,1,NOT
in business if youre not available at those hours youre not doing a good job it isnt as if the boss just gets that into hisher head part of your performance is to not drop the ball like not being there when needed,1,NOT
there is no gap in low paying jobs thats for sure,1,NOT
i hate when femenist bring this up as a fact just ask them how that would even be a thing if the constitution states itd be illegal and why dont companies hire way more girls if theyre cheaper,2,NOT
those images at  dont say women do more than men to raise kids in two parent households they show that equal plus father does moretogether  outweighs mother does more  so in  of households the father is doing the same or more than the mother of course when you say mom does more  vs dad does more  it looks like dads do x less work and if you run the graphics by quickly and say that out loud while you do it adds even more to the misleading nature the only category of the three presented where mom does more is taking care of sick kid mom  equal  dad does more   is greater than  thats hardly a shocking indictment of fathers everywhere then you have to make the leap from those numbers to pay when it isnt clear how that would directly translate into earnings of someone  years out of business school,2,NOT
how does this have  dislikes,1,NOT
think about this hr is the largest highest paid femaledominated job in america they know the wage data for everyone in the company how long theyve worked there and their job performance they are responsible for making sure employees are treated equitably and fairly in the company to avoid labor law infractions you know like the equal pay law if there is such thing as a wage gap you can blame hr in other words its women keeping women down,3,NOT
finally no more leftard bullshit good work,3,NOT
wage gap in st world country exists companies hire all women so they spend less money stonks,2,NOT
i watched the whole thing before i consider disliking and this seems interesting its not a blatant feminist video saying that discrimination exists against women in the work place but the video shows actual research and studies as to how the pay gap widens in strict inflexible jobs because of how women bear children,1,NOT
men and women make different choices even that study that compares house hold chores with full time working parents doesnt take into account that while the work is considered full time the men are working insanely more hours especially when full time in these studies is pegged at  hours men routinely will work  hours in their jobs women value flexibility over pay this has been proven in countless surveys and studies yet vox seems to think that you should be able to have flexible hours aka not work as much but some how he paid the same there is no discrimination going on there is no social conditioning in a master patriarchal scheme to make women think they want flexible hours men and women make different choices and thats ok stop creating discontent where it is not warranted women in the west are the freest and liberated peoples on the globe just stop it,2,NOT
the major thing about the wage gap is that it is false taking the average of anything is not scientific ill play the average game on the opposite side on average men do more overtime take less time off dont take parental leave without losing their job and are better negotiators taking the initial salary of somebody is pure bs because its up to the employer im too tired of writing these to not press the shoeonhead button,2,NOT
also why does the number always change somewhere like its  cents  cents  cents like m ake up your fuckig mind,2,NOT
conclusion there is an inequality in how men and women are paid but it isnt anywhere near as simple as people want it to be,1,NOT
equal pay act of   i can never remember which one it is most of it comes from overtime and the fact that men ask for raises more often alongside the actual jobs,2,NOT
where is my wage gap button oh shoeonhead where are you,1,NOT
the wage gap is bull  women actually work less hours than men and i have evidence to support it women are most likely to get sick and take a day off so there is no gap there is just men work longer,2,NOT
the lack of flexible hours isnt the only reason why women earn less,2,NOT
if there is one woman in america working a legal job getting paid less than a male coworker with exactly the same hours education contract time in the job etc then she can sue the pants off her employer as well as publicly humiliate them on social media doesnt really sound like a patriarchal conspiracy,2,NOT
so the pay gap is basically between mom and others then isnt the issue when women get pregnant women have no other choice but take care of kids and work less while men have no choice but work harder if there is more support for working moms such as childcare and paternity leave this situation will be better,1,NOT
moms take care of their kids and work just like their husbands you either married a loser or should just not have kids if that bothers you,2,NOT
i hate this channel now they went full feminist,2,NOT
in malaysia we dont have gender wage gap since ,1,NOT
basically the video is trying to tell women to pick certain jobs so they can keep rearing children how about we change the gender role behind child rearing and ensure that both parents pick up the tab so women can choose whatever career they like  just like men,1,NOT
who pays most of the bills any surveys done on this or do we even need one,2,NOT
such a great video i read the paper by goldin and this summary of the key findings was so good,1,NOT
why is this  years old and im only seeing it now and its from vox which ought to be quoted by at least half of news feeds,1,NOT
do men and women toilet cleaners make the same money,1,NOT
the wage gap looks at the average pay for men and women without having in count the personal choices vacacions promotions time worked plus it only looks at full time jobs and thats why it is a myth,2,NOT
what they miss is that its a myth choice is oppress apparently,2,NOT
whats with all the dislikes this was a perfectly rational video let me guess it was people who who dont believe the wage gap exists and were too stupid to understand that the video was in agreeance,2,NOT
i think if they make jobs flexible itll make people lazy i mean hey might as well not go into work at all if you have a good enough excuse right womans just gotsta learn to hire baby sitters or trust theys kids,2,NOT
so if we will make  on the dollar i should hire only women to save money because a man would be  more expensive why should i hire menhmmmmmmmmmmmm,2,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same jobs it has nothing to do with discrimination  briliant human being,1,NOT
so lowkey she said its womens fault for the wage gap by not working shitty hours ,2,NOT
feminists are gonna go mad,2,NOT
and only when the boss is around they women do any work,3,NOT
ppl who say women get paid less because they have kids yes because its their choice to have kids and get pregnant by themselves,1,NOT
studies showwww that  of like peopllllle afflicted with like vocal fryyyyyye are like womennnn,1,NOT
what people miss about unicorns,1,NOT
i have been waiting for this ever since the video came out,1,NOT
aaah yes we understand that the earnings gap is not caused by discrimination but by personal choices instead of accepting that there are just different financial decisions that most women make lets change the entire work schedule structure of jobs in order to benefit women who make different decisions yes this totally doesnt seem absolutely insane and idiotic at all nope not at all someonepleasehelpthisworld,3,NOT
excuse me but i have a degree in feminist dance theory and im still getting paid less than people with electrical engineering degrees thats s e x i s m,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt tell us how long theyve been working there what theyve done or their productivity it just tells us their wages,1,NOT
no wage gap,2,NOT
you forget to say that its the choice of the woman not to go to those late meetings or to stay late for work you also didnt mention that men are far more likely to ask for a raise wouldnt that mean that men would get raises more than women also if the wage gap were a real thing wouldnt all business owners only hire women so they could pay them less and save money the wage gap comes down to the choices of workers this really shouldnt be a hot topic in the us,2,NOT
a video with common sense good job,1,NOT
you ever gonna mention race,1,NOT
dont people realize theres no reason to fight the wage gap it doesnt exist because theres a law here in the usa that doesnt allow that if you truly believe you make less than your male counterpart while doing the exact same hours and lev of work and same position as him etc etc then sue you can win,2,NOT
what they miss the fact that it doesnt exist ,2,NOT
this video didnt favor one side or the other did it decent humans try to help other humans,1,NOT
whos going to cover the choice of less paying jobs in detail  this video becomes a failed attempt,2,NOT
 its an earnings gap not a wage gap,1,NOT
what if men are created to work and women are designed not to,3,NOT
what i would like to know is how many single women live on starvation pay after pension compared to single men because these women continue to pay men about  cdn per hour for construction for example and vehicle maintenance people about  an hour while most of these wealthy male pensioners can do their own work i suspect most women on pension earn about half of what men receive and therefore have serious troubles paying for food clothing medicine medical care etc in old age compared to what men have it seems no government will ever dare tally the differences in each province or state with regard to single female pensioners versus male because they dont want to admit that old men are living like kings compared to old women who in many cases are starving,1,NOT
you see the wage gap comes up as a really cool statistic for feminists the fact is women earn about the same in the same jobs with the same hours as their male counterparts why did i say about the same because men are much more likely to ask for a raise there is nothing keeping you from earning the same as the men its simply you and science  but that doesnt really change things,3,NOT
are we sure this wage gap is true,2,NOT
when my mother gets paid k a year a man working for mcdonalds would defiantly get less there is no wage gap just find a better job,2,NOT
the wage gap isnt real women in general are less willing to go for higher paying jobs compared to men,2,NOT
this also does not discuss the fact that men with mba degrees work  more hours than women it also does not take into consideration the male ego vs the female ego in business the is one of the factors that contributes the need for continued exponential success in males slightly more than it does in females psychologically and physiologically men and women are different that difference is sometimes a good thing mean that females are better at certain things than males and vise versa this difference in skill can then used to run a successful business,2,NOT
i imagine shes upset that vox doesnt pay heras much as the male workers there,2,NOT
lmao women working at mcdonalds crying about how they make less money than male lawyers,2,NOT
she disproved the wage gap in the first  of the video,1,NOT
wow nowhere as biased as i expected it to be good job,1,NOT
at the end men have to stay in titanic when its sinking,2,NOT
in what jobs women earn more money than man there must be some,1,NOT
another seemingly obvious point that gets overlooked all the time is how relationships are formed between men and women call it whatever you will but women usually end up dating and marrying men who earn at least as much as they do often more when you are talking about people in higher earning positions lets say k and it comes time to start a family it is often easier for the woman to take time off work or leave the work force all together when their spouse is making enough money this also has a negative affect on women taking on more work or chasing promotions which comes with more work there is no real incentive to do so when the husband is earning good money the combined income of both people earns themselves a very comfortable life style there simply isnt a need for the woman to earn more next up actually compare two people in the same exact position within an industry chase as many examples of two or more people in identical positions as possible and study the earnings gap,2,NOT
women choose to be pediatricians instead of surgeons,3,NOT
i am here to read the comments written by triggered people,2,NOT
i have a feeling that the next generation in the us will have women being the breadwinners if it is true that college degrees will average better paying jobs women will outpace men women are enrolling and graduating college more than men this number keeps increasing as women start to assert their professional power onto the job market starting a family will go by the wayside i am certain that as this happens the population will start to significantly decrease in the upper middle class this has already started to happen in japan,1,NOT
i thought men and women were equal ,2,NOT
males usually work longer then women so that explains the wage gap,2,NOT
hell yeah vox is smart again,1,NOT
i appreciated how this researched and went further into reasoning it definitely pinpoints the roots,1,NOT
the reason men make more is because they work more hours in the same jobs the reason they work more is because theyre more ambitious on average the reason for this is because men are expected to earn money and pay for dates to court women women can always fall back on marrying rich so it stunts the ambition level of the average woman there isnt much that can be done about this as the root cause of these behaviors are biological lets just accept that there will be a pay gap but its closed when you consider the payingfordates gap and the fact that women control  of consumer spending even though men make about  of the income in the usa what does that last piece of data show yes that men make the majority of income but women spend it they spend mens money ask any marketing or advertiser which gender they sell to have you ever heard of a woman called a deadbeat in our culture no why is that within that answer also lies the answer to the wage gap bandeadbeat,3,NOT
no mention of how the average number of hours worked by men and women each week are considerably different,1,NOT
find the firm that is breaking the law and than we will talk,1,NOT
those dislikes are high must be all the tumber feminists triggered because they explained it without the use of a patriarchal conspiracy welldone vox still though is it really a problem if its life choices,2,NOT
so the jist of the video is women get paid less because children give men some power like ability to decide if a child can live or be aborted equal property rights in divorces some say around the house some say in how the children are raised then the universe might be kinder to you until then thats your issue to deal with stop blaming men,3,NOT
easy to miss something when it doesnt exist,2,NOT
i think this video makes sense even though i am an antifeminist,1,NOT
women earn less cuz they work less hours then men or they dont work dangerous job that can get them killed,3,NOT
voxs uniformed leftist viewers only hearing these things for the first time,2,NOT
most people forget feminism means equality for women and men not just women or just men,1,NOT
dont have kids and pursue job prospects more aggressively women its not hard to understand,3,NOT
feminism is bullshit women earn less than men because they just do,3,NOT
can you guys make one based on race please and help me understand why the economic situation is so bad for many black communities,1,NOT
there a lots of other factors you skipped over women typically work fewer overtime hours and use more of their vacation and sick days the whole wage gap basically boils down to the choices people make and not their gender,2,NOT
dislike because they did a great job dismantling the wage gap then said it still exists it is a minor difference that can be explained by mentality and willingness to negotiate pay not a gap perpetuated by womanhating capitalists just a difference that occurs because of many factors factors almost entirely based on personal choice,2,NOT
there are so many wrong logical pathways in this video email me at bmartinacom so we can talk about it,2,NOT
the factual feminist here on youtube did an entire series on why this wage gap is basically just a statistical variance in how people choose what to do with their lives women are not at all interested in dangerous dirty disgusting professions like sewage and mining and construction these do not appeal to women at all they would rather have a fun safe lowpaying job than a miserable dangerous highpaying job men are the sacrificial laborers of our society and we pay them significantly more than women because of that that is also why women take on the dominant role in the household because the man is more likely to die and it mitigates the damage to the home if he does these could be socially constructed things or just pure evolutionary necessity either way the wage gap doesnt tell any of the story its just a statistic that keeps getting repeated over and over again with no context,3,NOT
 out of  people are feminists,1,NOT
these dumb triggered feminist need to stop talking about the wage gapthere is literally a law that you can not pay someone less based on there sexraceand religion,2,NOT
this is the reason why women still from men i lost  dollars and found it in my gf drawer i dumped her,2,NOT
he wrote what economists were saying in the s,1,NOT
maybe because men are going out of their way to work constantly and goes to work despite being hurt or sick theyre natural leaders and theyre always trying to do the best women have the potential they just dont go for the job that men go for,3,NOT
i dont see gender so there is no wage gap,2,NOT
the gender wage gap has been disproven a million times by a million different people including economists independent researchers and even the government the only reason that it appears this way in some studies is because the studies are not done correctly rather than look at the average pay for people working the same hours at the same job at the same company and the only variable being gender the look at the total amount of money earned by women and men in the united states which is not how you do statistics this is because it does not include the types of jobs people from the two genders are choosing for example the stem fields which pay among the highest salaries are almost solely male despite the colleges trying to convince women to go into stem for many many years the mainly female dominated industries are things like childcare cosmetics and social studies which do not pay anywhere near as much as the male dominated stem fields and other male dominated areas please stop spouting the third wave feminist nonsense as fact because its objectively not,2,NOT
there is wage gap because men is doing better not because of discrimination for same job experience and hours of work women gets payed same as men,2,NOT
they miss it because it does not exist,2,NOT
its literally factually incorrect,2,NOT
what feminist dont get about the wage gap it doesnt exist,2,NOT
damn vox back it again with cherry picked statistics,2,NOT
if they want to earn more money then maybe they shouldnt have had a kid in the first place,3,NOT
to those who think its fake this audience isnt going to be responsive to your ideas go throw your privilege around somewhere else,2,NOT
okay yes but how about modeling women make much more than men do,1,NOT
when comparing a male and female nurse yes the male nurse is paid  more this is because the male has more qualifications the reason male nurses gravitate to the best paying nursing specialties work longer hours and find jobs in cities with the highest compensation aka the willing to relocate career choices and educational differences explain most if not all the gender gap in nursing,2,NOT
make men have children  walk around with a bowling ball up their ass problem solved,5,ABU
of courseexplained by a feminist,2,NOT
in all of those pew research center studies in all but  men did equal or more work than mothers,2,NOT
hours should not be made more flexible women just need to be better at managing their time along with men taking an equal share of parenting responsibilities work is work for a reason you are there because thats whenhow your employer needs you to be,2,NOT
the accent of this person makes it very difficult to take this seriously,3,NOT
wow as a conservative i expected to dislike the video from vox this wasnt too bad,1,NOT
thank you but i have to lolz at the fact that they had to make a woman covered this story to prevent ppl from just screaming sexist pigs,2,NOT
just came here to say there are only  genders,5,ABU
women want the world to change to be easier and more flexible for them while men go and do their job no matter how hard it is this is the attitude that is earning you less money,3,NOT
so theyre payed the same but more men work than women because they have babies and stuff well thats good for me,2,NOT
let me show use feminist tactics to turn this around it is so unfair that women get to spend more time taking care of and influencing the small minds of the children while the man has to work disproportionally longer and offer hours at work only to bring more money home that is spent on the family there is a working and family time gape in this country and we need to stop it lolwut,3,NOT
i feel like there is a natural inclination for woman to take care of kids more than men when you look in nature its typically the females that look after the new borns i know humans are different than birds but its interesting,2,NOT
basically they are saying leave it up to the men and stay at the house,2,NOT
i just want to know the song used in the background ,1,NOT
seed gender in title triggered,3,NOT
wouldnt it be much more risky for a business to pay women less money and therefore more costly if you dont work as much or do difficult jobswell of course your not getting paid as much you can either work like a man all the time or have kids stop being selfish telling yourself you can have it all,3,NOT
great job very well explained i see no hard manual job in those studieswonder why,2,NOT
i wonder how many of these petulant man children in the comments actually watched the video to realise that their bickering is pointless and irrelevant to what is being presented here,2,NOT
her vocal fry is so extreme,1,NOT
you didnt take into account the dirty jobs like garbage collectors or high risk jobs like police or firefighter women dont want to do these jobs and the high salary of these jobs due to how gross and how dangerous they are make the gap bigger men are more willing to take life threatening jobs than women just because they pay more and help them support their families is also why of every  work related deaths  of them are men,2,NOT
lol than hire only women srsly guys the girls in my office are always looking to cut corners male coworkers work harder,3,NOT
so if theres anything i got from this its that men are lazy and leave the mothers to take care of the children so they make less money right am i right,2,NOT
 i love how you advocate flexible hours rather than ideally having men and women hold the same responsibilities at home because men just cant do it  but the comments section still manage to be an argument of how the problem doesnt exist  i guess it really makes sense then that my mother and her sisters make a lot more than their husbands because they work in jobs with flexible hours as a result they have to work a lot harder though,1,NOT
wtf k dollars of wage omg,1,NOT
does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didnt watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work eg business this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men  women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesnt account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from    men earned more out the gate  its a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from  all the way back to  i mean really  the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their s and s was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument  if you look at women born  same thing for women    if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument   these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women arent payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument   if you dont show up for work or cant work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesnt have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her  i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in  so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women arent paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they werent but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women the simple answer is no,2,NOT
the biggest thing people miss is that the wage gap is complete bollocks,2,NOT
awesome video vox this is infinitely better than that ridiculous entertainmentnewsstyle video from a few weeks ago this is fair balanced and factual,2,NOT
stop calling it a wage gap its not a wage gap you havent measured wages youve measured earnings ,1,NOT
nope nope to all facts racism and sexism are the reason for everything in the world,1,NOT
literally the ad before this video was degree for women and had some girl in a suit prepping in front of the mirror going to confront her boss about her male colleague making more than her and then it ended with a slogan about closing the wage gap this was a good video but i wish you had been more critical of the major public figures who purport the wage gap to be something it fundamentally it is not overt discrimination against women when its more about lifestyle choices,2,NOT
i dont understand why people want mothers to work and fathers to care for children there is a reason that these socalled gender roles have developed and it is the simple fact that men and women differ biologically women on average do a much better job with child rearing than men on the other hand men on average are willing to sacrifice almost everything for their families financial stability ive seen women throw it all away to be mothers and ive seen men throw themselves into work to support their families at the cost of rarely being with them the happiest families are those who find a happy medium but the woman should be the caregiver and the man the breadwinner thats just how it works,2,NOT
what vox is really trying to tell is that women should get more than their male counterparts even if they are in the office or not whether they leave the office early or not present when clients need them instead they should be paid for staying homefantastic thinking vox,2,NOT
i cant wait to be a stay at home dad let the women do the work for a change ,2,NOT
getting there vox,1,NOT
in other words women have more privilege flexibility and choice and can achieve a lifework balance men simply have less workplace rights and have to work more than women women dont need to work as much as men because quite often men support their partners lifestyle choices if you want the wage gap to disappear lets stop putting the responsibility on men to pay for everything and lets give them equal workplace rights paternity leave and retirement age,2,NOT
i dont feel sorry for these actresses in hollywood where they make millions,2,NOT
stop living in lala land get stem degree its the easier degree and  ndly ladies pick ur spouses wisely and know how many kids u want ,2,NOT
there is no wage gap there is however an earnings gap as people who do the same job with the same credentials tend to get paid the same amount because regardless of the business owner they want to maximize profits and thus pay their employees as little as possible while still retaining more skilled individuals however if billy works  hour weeks and mandy works  hour weeks one will make more initially and be more likely to receive promotions in the future which results in better wages and thus even greater earnings down the line this is the jist of what many purposefully mislabel as the wage gap as a wage is the rate one is paid hourly not what you earn over a specific amount of time including nonwork hours that is what we call earnings,2,NOT
the only thing worse than sjws are antisjws incoming triggered antisjws,2,NOT
it doesnt exists thats all,2,NOT
what do you tell a woman with one black eye nothing you already told her once what do you tell a woman with two black eyes nothing you already told her twice,5,ABU
this is all evidence towards that women are earning less because of their work place decisions not because of a apparent societal stigma against woman,2,NOT
its pretty simple different job different pay you want a higher paying job work for it its illegal to pay someone lower because of their gender,2,NOT
ive been telling people that  cent bullshit is a totally misleading statistic for years,2,NOT
so the wage gap is a product of individual life choices playing out differently for men and women because of sexual dimorphism who knew,2,NOT
this is one of the first good videos on the wage gap ive seen it shows that the gap isnt due to companys being sexist but infact due to the types of jobs men and women tend to take,2,NOT
this why im christian i believe the woman does hard work taking care of the family while the father is at work to get all the supplies,3,NOT
that its fake is that the secret,2,NOT
if the wage gap was true dont you think businesses would only hire women because they could pay them less,2,NOT
the information shown in this video doesnt account for how women are more unlikely to not work over time more likely are to take time off work and how women are more likely to follow their time scheduled for work while men are more likely to be their when the company needs them calls them in companies pay more for employees who are able to do this women also own the majority in in four of the five lowest paying majors women are also less likely to take jobs involving risk and are less competitive in the work force the video is correct in how most statistics that show a pay gap dont show the factors yet neither does theirs there are more factors involved then what the video has told you and what i have stated the video does not give a full synopsis on the wage gap,2,NOT
urrgh if the gender paygap existed the way a western rd wave feminist would want you to believe with their feels over facts logic dont you think employers would hire more women and less men,2,NOT
wage gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
men dont take women studies,2,NOT
my experience has been that i find a greater majority of men at an executive level than women but i see far more women at middle management roles there will be a trend shift as women take on more and more executive roles  it seems inevitable,1,NOT
what about how the wage gap affects people of color,1,NOT
thanks for coalescing all the research it paints a pretty comprehensive picture,1,NOT
you forget about the amount of risk taking that men tent do take which yields results in business and either gets you and your company richer or fired every woman i know in the field of business or politics tends to play it safe that is effective but also affects the wage gap in business a whole lot i also wonder about the statistics of demanding a raise look like,2,NOT
most men lack the orderliness and patience needed for child care so women are often relegated voluntarily or involuntarily for domestic work it is sad thing that male humans are evolutionary weak in parenting when some birds fish and amphibians show good male nestkeeping and parenting,2,NOT
tldr women cant turn up to work on time,3,NOT
ill be damned a quality video from vox,1,NOT
are you aware of babysitters ,2,NOT
how to stop the wage gap just never have children,2,NOT
honestly at one point it was c then c now c make up your damn mind,1,NOT
 men were earning k and women were earning  less k now correct me if im wrong but isnt that  less,1,NOT
the data is from between  years ago you cant apply that to the current day and call it a fair comparison,1,NOT
wow women have kids and do child bearing what it kind of seems like women are naturally inclined to be better at taking care of kids,3,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap it doesnt exist,2,NOT
so many idiots the wage gap does exist however thats just a statistic women dont pick the same jobs as men therefore they get paid less posting comments saying the video is sexist are retarded so are the ironic comments saying it doesnt exist like jesus look at the dislikes its just a statistic,2,NOT
wage gap isent a thing comparing all the avrg of all men and all women what you actualy get is a representation of how strong the difrence between the rich and the poor is lets say  people from group x get to earn  a month another group of  people caled group y earn  aswell yet  of those do not have eny income and  of those have an income of  now you have a group in wich the avrg earning for  people is  and  people in this group wherefor the avrg earning is  now you have an avrg of something around  for group y so yes on avrg group x will earn les then group y but do you realy want to be a part of group y where you have a  chance to end up in poverty and posibly die of starvation at the off chance of  where you might earn more money as you can spend on top of that you have to take into acount that those who are earning  a month probably are giving up the chance of a personal life starting from there s to there s now so lets say you dont want to be a part of this group that gives up everything to earn money now you are just stuck with a  chance to end up in poverty and a  chance to earn a living unlike the  chance to earn a living so you tell me would you rather be a part of group x or y i know what my answer will be i would like to be part of group x and on avrg earn les then group y this btw isent taking into acount chance of having an acident with permanent disability working conditions and all other kinds of bs u whud rather not deal with,2,NOT

if the wage gap is caused by women having babies then that means the mothers will be taking care of the baby while the husband is making the money for the familyunless of course they are a single mom with all  kids because its incredibly difficult for a man to get custody of even  of their kids why are all these self entitled brats waging a war in society about rights,2,NOT

isnt wage paid according to the service you give men are paid more in some jobs because they provide more service and customer satisfaction in these jobs so they have to earn more i think that makes sense it also explains why female models are paid more than male models the answer is simple the female models have a higher service satisfaction ratio than their male counterparts so why all the fuss i wonder,2,NOT
there is no gender wage gap,2,NOT
another way to close the wage gap across the board is to have both parents take on a more equal share of domestic responsibilities,1,NOT

i hate vox but this is probably their most unbiased video ever made so i will give it it a like in my mind a real like hell no,1,NOT
yeah men should take more pregnancy breaks wait no but they should spend more time at home breastfeeding the kids hold on its almost like women are biologically designed as caretakers for children also did you ever consider that the pay gap isnt meant to be closed maybe women will always be less competitive maybe women will always want to have kids maybe women will always prefer jobs like teaching kindergarten while men prefer jobs like particle physics,5,ABU

in essence blames childrearing with the assessment that women do most of the work there with men slacking doesnt sound like news to me also doesnt sound correct sounds more like a basic explanation that appeals to those who believe in traditional male and female roles based upon a male dominated society where women are tasked with taking care of the kids,2,NOT
why are all the studys from the s does that reflect our society today dont think so,1,NOT
its not because youre lazy jays just have different priorities in life theyre taking time off of work to raise kids and do special things with them when men tend to stay and work to make money thats not sexist thats just a fact,2,NOT
an easy solution is an equal maternity and paternity leave then the comparison in the same occupational field between men and women would be equal right,1,NOT
yes the wage gap exists but not because of injustice or discrimination people in free capitalist societies are free to do whatever they want women and men make different choices in life and so they earn different medium wages since this is not an issue why do we need to address it why do we need to close the wage gap when this is the result of individual freedom,2,NOT
there is no gap per hour worked as most people are lead to believe this video was sort of half admitting this but never was it mentioned that same job per hour worked is going to be the same amount of pay in aus industries have to abide by ebas or enterprise business agreement which means who ever you are you get a set amount per hour this however does not apply to small businesses like a local fish and chips shop or something,2,NOT

considering the wage gap doesnt exist i dont see what there is to see,2,NOT
they always state  cents per dollar leading everyone to assume that its an hourly calculation they never say that its an annual amount and not hourly the reality of the situation is that for a multitude of various reasons women work less hours on average annually than men thats not an opinion or an assumption thats the pure raw data,2,NOT

summary women get off your ass and get an education so you can get paid the same,3,NOT
men make up  of workplace deaths and suicides but we arent arguing to close that gargantuan gap are we in addition the wage gap is irrelevant as despite earning less women control more money than men men earn  of all income but only account for  of domestic spending men only spend  of what they earn after tax in contrast women make up  of all income but control  of domestic spending meaning women on average spend  more money than they earn rd wave feminism is a joke,2,NOT
did not mention job risks at all,1,NOT
i understand its kind of a trend right now but its really annoying the more you hear it women are purposefully making a raspy swing in their voice when they are speaking the california rasp its psychologically a way to show the woman doesnt feel comfortable sharing what shes sayingthe vocal tone is slow disengaging and tired kim kardashian and her siblings are great examples of it unfortunately the woman in this video sharing important information is doing it  look up the term vocal fry,2,NOT

why so many dislikes,1,NOT
you do overlook one fact though the reason women keep taking on the majority of child raising is because the state gives the woman all the power and money and women have better protection for flexible working than men,2,NOT
if women would stop breeding they would be able to climb the income gap it is children that put you in poverty,2,NOT
woah a balanced pov how refreshing,1,NOT
just fyi mens rights activists are pushing for more fathers rights if feminists just helped out more to push this type of thinking perhaps you would not have such a problem but right now fathers are more conerned about even takeing their children to a park and being a parent incase they get called out for being a pedo ,2,NOT
this video didnt really prove a point or make any points at all out of the men and women who took that business degree the men probably would have gone on to take jobs such as a stockbroker or a corporate investment banker while the women would have taken more casual jobs such as supply chain managers why because they choose to on average most women just arent up to working the same hours as men wether or not they have kids to look after women also get sick more than men what most feminists dont know is that it is completely illegal for a boss to pay two workers differently for the same job but is it the same job at the mcdonalds i work at the male workers keep the shop running while the female workers mostly talk and take really lengthy bathroom breaks this video also didnt consider that even after the test subjects completed their business degrees not all of them would have gone on to work careers in business the video just said the income they are making why feminist news sources like buzzfeed and the abc keep making these type of videos is completely beyond me all the comments are negative,2,NOT

i quit listening at the women earn  less comment   vs  is  less or  as much but not  less if they cant even understand gradeschool math can we really trust anything they have to say concerning the law of supply and demand in a freemarket economy,2,NOT
but what causes that small difference in pay we know it cannot be gender discrimination because we have the equal pay act which makes it illegal to be paid differently in identical circumstances so are the men being paid more because they have more education or job experience human capital that was not talked about in this video,2,NOT
dont scroll down the comment section is antifeminists who didnt watch the video and are copy and pasting their revolutionary wagegap arguments despite the video kind of addressing the wage gap different jobs and earnings issue you have been warned,1,NOT
aside from any political affiliation and any issue in particular if you cant do math dont do it,2,NOT
number  it doesnt even exist,2,NOT

was ready to dislike when i saw this title and bam vox is actually on the right side here,1,NOT
i notice child support wasnt mentioned,1,NOT
if it is possible to hire women that add the same value as any man on a significantly lower salary then surely free market forces would ensure that no men are hired because the leading company in every industry would be the ones which exclusively hire women due to their wage bill being the lowest and therefore before being able to drive out all the competition with lower prices just a thought or maybe the patriarchy doesnt want its firms to be run in the most costefficient way because they love oppressing women too much clearly that is the more likely explanation,2,NOT
its a salary gap not a wage gap,1,NOT

a month ago i was a sexist pig for saying that the wage gap has nothing to do with equal pay for the same work marginal progress,1,NOT
theres a little bit of a misstatement at   men make  more than women when you compare the ratio of one value to another the primaryoriginalbase value  that is the one being compared to  always goes on the bottom of the ratio so while men at k do make  more than women at k women at k actually make  less than men at k or stated conversely those women make  of what the men make written out women compared to men is  for men compared to women its ,2,NOT
the reason women do almost all of the work of looking after babies is that feminists have brainwashed the world to believe that men are incapable of nurturing and gentleness you wont entertain the possibility that a man has any good characteristics or else feminism would collapse in an instant the other thing feminists refuse to consider is the first thing any man ever does with his pay whenever he gets it he hands it straight to his wife,3,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap the gender wage gap because it doesnt exist,2,NOT

you adjuste for diffrent jobs good girl now lets also adjust for hours workedexperience frequency of asking for a raiseetc and there you go no gender pay gap ofcourse i would love to hear what femenists solution to the mythical gender pay gap is  the  solutions i come up with to the nonexistent paygap are as follows  everyone gets payed the same regardles of work hours worked experience and skill socialist solution  get rid of jobs completly and just have robots do the entier thing then give people a living wage rbe variant solution  force men and women to work jobs so that everything becomes  equity selution  money is done away with entierly communistrbe solution,2,NOT

she cant eat chicken when shes sober minded aka she can eat chicken almost every day of the week,2,NOT
all you people dancing with joy that the wagegap does not exist and feminists are wrong should rethink this whole situation women dont talk about this because they want the same pay for the same job cause that has been already dealth with and i mean sane women not idiots featured in buzzfeed videos reading the scripts theyre given they just want equal treatment in the workplace that is the problem and the main reason why women are flagging up the disproportion in total earnings of men vs women the inequality exists because of women being expected to engage in the family life more than men that is one of the reasons imo its the biggest factor in todays society success is measured unfortunately but its the truth by how much money you make and how great of a professional career you have it applies to both genders women feel like they will have a tougher time with accomplishing that kind of success than men and it is rightly so most of us men and women want to have children one day but for women having children means that their professional career will take a hit just to make this a bit more real one of my friends asked her boss why her colleague was given a promotion although shes been working for the company for a longer time she left out the fact that hes not as good at his job and the fact that he is a man she didnt expect that would be the reason and the answer was well you have two children at a young age so we thought giving you more responsibility right now could be damaging to your private life fun fact  the guy also has two children at a very similar age of course my friend left that company thank god obviously that inequality is not mens or womens fault its how our society is built but we should look at possibilities of dealing with that problem as increasingly women are just giving up having children completely the ageing society is already a huge issue that is progressing something needs to be done and as of now there are many people  again both male and female  that are not even acknowledging that the problem exists wake up people i tried to stress that no one who is a sane human being is blaming men for this its not all of the men of this planet that should get together to fix this its a problem of the society as a whole and we should try to deal with it thats all,1,NOT
she totally blew past the fact that the bar graph showed just as high numbers of shared equally vs mothers do more so yes fathers do more only had  but isnt that the goal to have shared equal responsibilities isnt that what the feminists want oh wait thats right though they want it to be men do more work,2,NOT

up in  the wage gap doesnt exist its basically what job you have and if what kind of position you have at that job such as manger or co manger or janitor or cashier an pc men or more willing to do overtime if your not on salary and most of these points are when woman were allowed to be paid less so the wage gap is just another bullshit feminist reason to start problems yes you are right it did exist then but now its impossible or if it happens its most likely jail time i but tbh i just want triggered femnazis saying the wage gap is still that thing in the comments lel,3,NOT

so basically its not all about a gender gap in pay thats the problem its flexibility gap between genders that causes the phantom gap in gender pay interedasting thanks i will distribute this message around,1,NOT
if companies could pay less to hire women then why would they ever hire men or is it actually based on average time worked vs our social stigma of men have to work more to support their family or they are not a good husband or how each gender has tendencies to pick different jobs,2,NOT
i have many female friends who chose to get into different fields and made the same money as men the problem is they fall in love and want to have kids they get emotionally attached as a mother and take breaks which forces them to either stay in current position or take a break from their current job while the men who still shoulder most of the expenses continue to compete for higher wages which makes it appear men make more then women on average the simple truth is it is life choice decisions that affect income on the opposite end of the spectrum i have seen female coworkers who are extremely career oriented and they make higher income in higher positions then other men because they dont care about having kids or have a male partner who works in a lower paying position and is the house husband it all comes down to choices but feminists and gender inequality advocates dont want to hear that also evidence shows that men on average dont live as long as women so go figure,2,NOT

theres still a huuge gap if you look up how much the employees earn per hour pluswomen also dont get promoted as easily as man and the wage gap during their child rearing years just shows how the market is unfriendly towards mothers who want to work and take care of their children at the same timeim talking about what they learn per hour working mothers are seen as women denying their responsibility of child rearing however its the opposite for working fathers they receive empathy from their bosses and have a higher wage than average men but what if the working mother is a single mom how is she supposed to raise her children alone and earning half of what a man earns per hour this video is also very misleading and disappointing even if you say that its only temporaryin other developed countrieslike japanthe wage gap actually widens even more after the thirtiesand reaches its peak at fifties and years of reduced make a huge difference on a womans life we should stop trying to excuse ourselves and start working on solving the problem we created,1,NOT

i dont really think there is a wage gap in the way people think i think men earn their increased pay compared to a woman unless its an exceptional case of a boss or manager who is truly sexist butthere is a deeper problem women are led to believe they are weaker too emotional and too volatile all their lives women dont just compete against men but they also compete against women lots of women in power seem to see themselves as an exception and supporting another woman is threatening to their perceived special position as a woman so the wage gap ends up being because women are not striving as high as men but a lot of it is because of psychological manipulation to believe they arent good enough,1,NOT
so basically women arent paid less rather they work less hours and therefore earn less than someone who can work more hours seems fair enough  why does this need changing,2,NOT
there is no wage gap men do harder more dangerous and physical jobs therefore men get paid more you ppl cant be this stupid,2,NOT
if i would write a research paper at my university like they researched in this video i would have to do the course again for sure,1,NOT
all dislikes are feminists in denial,2,NOT
this is actually a good explanation thanks vox,1,NOT
never change vox,1,NOT
for  minutes vox shows that the wage gap is actually an earnings gap but somehow still calls it a wage gap throughout,1,NOT
ummm excuse me but what business school are you talking about where people have an average salary over k just after graduation,1,NOT
thw wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked and sick days it has nothing to do with the same job or discrimination,2,NOT
the wage gap exists but not due to sexism women work less hours choose less demanding jobs and are less aggressive in negotiating salaries,2,NOT
theres a wage gap because of the different choices men and women make not because of discrimination ,2,NOT
what age gap,1,NOT
comparing salaries for people who earn over  cry me a river,1,NOT
can you please upload source link,1,NOT
yes there is a gap between your legs american women are worthless good for nothing spoiled twats,5,ABU
lemme answer that question it doesnt exist,2,NOT
funny that i just saw a video of prageru saying exactly the same which i love we rarely see the right and the left agreeing on issues,1,NOT
vox actually reported on this issue honestly once im shocked pleasantly shocked but shocked nonetheless,1,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist though,2,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap white women make much closer salary to men while latina and black women make much much lower on the dollar and asian women usually make close to or higher than white women any discussion of the gender pay gap that ignores race is incomplete at best,1,NOT
now i know why people say i shouldnt look at the comments,1,NOT
what about trans genders,1,NOT
its insane how many stupid people watched this video and missed the entire point it really is sad,2,NOT
why focus in the fact that women need to have jobs with schedule flexibility man can increase their contribution with children too,1,NOT
statistics on wage gaps are almost usually manpliated to make it look like its a real thing but the reality is that when you put all the factors in and not just add the occupancies and wage per hour you can make a clear deduction that the gender wage gap is in fact horse manure and on par with the flat earthers who believe the earth is flat,2,NOT
interesting video but it neglected to mention that men typically work longer hours and are as a group more economically productive over the course of their lives this means they contribute more to maintaining social systems than they get out of them because they pay more taxes so things basically even out in the end,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
honestly what bothers me is treating the men as the bad guy in this statistic i mean the use the fact a lot of women want to have kids as the big reason for the gap or the fact many women would just stay home with the kids however there is sth that doesnt get adressed mainly  well if a woman stays home who do you think needs to earn more to support that yeah a man i swear it like this statistic tries to frame men as these greedy bastards cheating women out of their money but if the woman stays home with kids that leaves the man responsible to earn money for that woman with kids so this horrible image of a man cheating woman out of her money is in fact earning money for the family why is this never brought up,2,NOT
i found a solution to all of this men will help close the wage gap and women a keep the thigh gap problem solve,3,NOT
she is talking about an earnings gap not a wage gap,1,NOT
damn i though i was going to be able to tear some hippie liberal bullshit apart after watching this video but you proved me wrong this video is extremely fair and balanced unlike most other vox videos hopefully they will stick to videos following this format and not regress,1,NOT
make a feminism joke plz,2,NOT
video came out  minutes ago and people already disliked,1,NOT
also people in the comments blaming the women for choosing to have children are missing the point it takes two to make a baby yet our society deems it to be the womens responsibility to raise the baby causing them to be seen as less reliable workers it is discrimination and sexism exploring the roots and causes of sexism does not disprove that sexism exists expanding your world view will help you realize that people face discrimination that you cant understand and you should try to empathize in order to fight it,1,NOT
men are wired to be vicious aggressive  protective that is how humans survive thousands of years ago with those sabertooth tigers lurking just outside your backyard apply those alpha male traits in the business and you get those male dominated ceos in business the big boss cannot wink fold and be weak otherwise the competitors and even business partners will eat himher alive testosterone makes a big difference as well,3,NOT
the main reasons theres a wage gap between men and women  women have more paid time off work compared to men when they have children this creates a debt to the companies that pay them  more women leave work or reduce their hours to spend more time in a homemaker role compared to men making it difficult for firms to earn back the extra debt that women create compared to men meaning that women are taxed as a gender to pay back the debt that is created by the entire gender which is also why the wage gap closes towards their later years because they can put more time into work instead of homemaking  men are more competitive and aggressive due to our naturally higher testosterone levels which means men are more likely to take risks apply for the higher paid jobs more productive in highly stressful work environments more likely to have the skills for senior level positions and are wayyy better at asking and negotiating pay rises not saying women cant do these things just a higher proportion of men are capable of it than women,2,NOT
i cant stand these comments though if this happens to be one of the first you see dont scroll any further,1,NOT
i dont care how small the gap is as long as there is a gap we arent done,1,NOT
my husband went to work while i stayed home how dare he wage gap me wagegapmetoo,2,NOT
who makes k,1,NOT
people see a set of data notice an inequality and immediately scream sexism what they miss is that the wages are exactly the same between genders but men usually work longer hours than women,2,NOT
cant believe vox made a video like this,1,NOT
if a man makes k and a woman makes k thats not  less thats  less maybe the gap can be partly explained by men being better at arithmetic and english,2,NOT
is someone willing to talk to me about why it is hard for some ladies to understand that there will be the wage gap for men tend to take risks and the jobs that go along with the risks are rewarded with a higher pay if majority of women do the jobs that are secretarial oriented they shouldnt expect to be paid more or equal to the man climbing a ft tree or digging out sewers and of course you forget the electricians who have to work themselves through the wires and some get electrocuted therefore women and men can not make the same because men tend to go for the jobs which are high end risky and jobs that involve a lot of mental capacity put into them and men do very good at them thats my take on the issue,2,NOT
yes the wage gap seems real and this video makes a good explanation that the women usually spend more time on the children thus they would get less money for work with specific hours but i dont get how this is that big of a problem as some people make it out to be when most women with children also have a husband who can use that extra money he makes to support the whole family,2,NOT
hot take from vox mothers do more mothering stop the press,2,NOT
how about man take on the same number of household chores than woman that way they are both equally affected by nonflexible hours seems easier and more natural than forcing every job to a flexible schedule,1,NOT
women are typically higher in agreeableness and being agreeable doesnt normally work well in business,2,NOT
what are you even talking about here what economists what happens in mids to s women child rearing surveys i know you mentioned a woman from harvardbravo still doesnt explain not only whatever your point actually is but you essentially explain away not counter any socalled gap pharmacists what btw simply saying the research means nothing good grief thanks for nothing,2,NOT
im so happy for trisha,1,NOT
i guess the wage gap as represented here not caused by active discrimination but work time choices does exist between the sexes i just dont understand why it is always put into the perspective of sexist discrimination i wouldnt deny there to be still some issues with that but just concentrating on this factual wage gap here i do not see why it is seen as such an important cause to close it by force as presented here it seems that the wage gap is mainly caused by the division of parenting tasks partners choose in which women still often do more of the unpaid work at home and therefore earn less careerwise surely our society will change so i guess work at home will be seperated more equally and i dont think this is a bad trend as it promotes egalitarian principles and so on this however is a cultural issue as this wage gap is mainly based on this choices and not structual discrimination its comparable with the single mom single dad ratio maybe yes there are essentially more single moms than dads and maybe it would be nicer to have this more equally but it is not due to discrimination of men but rather because of the still existing sex models children stay with their moms so it would be nice to dicuss this topics without always putting things as discriminative,2,NOT
show me  company in the us that pay men more than woman for the same job and i will stop saying that feminists are liars and i will donate every year to any lying fembots out there just  in  that pay men more than woman,2,NOT
so u r trying to find out how make as much as money while working less awesome count me in,2,NOT
mayb if u stop bla bla bla and start working harder it wouldnt be the case,2,NOT
and most of these people researching this are wait for shocker its women,1,NOT
my ears are bleeding,2,NOT
i cant believe there are still idiots believing this bullshit we have already debunked this myth,2,NOT
i can see how in some cases its unfair and unreasonable for there to be a gap however there are other reasons for it reasons im not gonna write an essay for but lets say alimony that seemingly only men get stuck with or in a good majority where the man is the main bred winner and the wife is doing it as a way for a few extra  or a way to get out of the house it can be similar to how a single mom gets special social treatment vs a single dad ie the mom needs money to help get a car fixed the sympathy is real but when a single dad needs to get money for a car he tends to be left to his own devices but hey im a white male millennial and we are apparently the problem to some people so what do i know,2,NOT
if a woman did the same job as me from day one and worked the same hours and we both had promotions at the same time she would earn the same as me end of talking generally is irrelevant and there will always be a difference in earnings much like there will always be a difference in time taken out of the workplace and time spent shopping for clothes it all comes down to a difference in life decisions which is evident between men and women peoples decisions are neither right or wrong nor good or bad but either way they will affect statistics,2,NOT
so because i work  hours and my sister works  hours im an evil person because i make more,2,NOT
oh no facts as a feminist i need to ignore so i can continue my agenda,2,NOT
girl howwww you gon make this video and not be intersectional and not mention that its the white woman who makes   to the white mans dollar this video flops,1,NOT
simple way to get rid of the wage cap change your major from liberal arts to engineering,2,NOT
this was almost a good video almost the points were good but you cant keep saying wage gap when you are so clearly explaining an earnings gap,2,NOT
the one glaring issue with the wage gap hoax never addressed,2,NOT
hahahah the feminist narrative of wage gap is slowly falling apart thank god this lie has limited time left for vox this was actually a pretty fair video they touch on the main topics of why women on average earn less,2,NOT
more people should be listening to christina hoff sommers on this topic not milo yiannoupoulis she says brilliant things without feeling the need to bring every ounce of attention to herself ruining the legitimacy of her arguments with the inflammatory nature of her ego  which is what milo does guess what dude when you say things like if women had been the predominant gender in the world throughout history instead of men wed all still be living in grass huts you arent really going to get very far in an argument about equality,1,NOT
well over  of work place deaths are men now let me ask you should there be a earnings gap or not,2,NOT
if i could pay a woman  less to do same amount of work as a man then all men would be unemployed end of story,2,NOT
fun fact wage gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
the incredible thing about this video is that it promotes making hours more flexible to accomodate mothers  needs but never questions the basic premise that it is up to women to take hours away from work to look after the kids  im deeply disappointed vox furthermore why does your only solution seem to be in the increasing liberalization and deregulation of businesses like pharmacies is this really the only way forward ,2,NOT
i respect this video much more than others covering the issue which typically makes my blood boil the reason being that instead of making a victimizing video bout how woman are so oppressed she attacks the issue by looking in to why it is that women tend to have lower salaries and its not because employers are paying less just because you are a woman its because most women bear children and mothers tend to their babies you cant be the best at work and have a all the time most people want in their families,1,NOT
its simple the wage gap doesnt exist why because if it did then companies left and right would be hiring females exclusively to save  of money from paying their workers income meaning that rather paying a good number of their male workers  theyd have to pay their allfemale workers  saving that extra  it doesnt take extensive research nor rocket science to debunk the wage gap myth however the point about women being also busy at home and how it relates to their wage is also a good example of why women also earn less in jobs than men great video,2,NOT
the outright denial of reality that some people show in these comments is disturbing,2,NOT
is there a gap in these fields i dont think these were studied bricklayers roofers aircraft mechanics plumbers road surface repair workers heavy equipment operators hazardous waste disposal technicians compressed gas delivery techs pallet jack operations tree trimmerclimbers firefighters chemical processors dockworkers drillers explosives handlers petro yardworkers pipefitters field laborers power generation containment cable riggers forklift operators for hazardous materials hvac service technicians fiber optic installers toolmakers lathe operators underground construction crewmembers coal miners loadersunloaders fuel station monitors utility maintenance techs welders window installers yard laborers elevated concrete laborers wastewater treatment operators machinists truckloaders iron workers bridge iron workers tunnel iron workers elevated construction ironworkers rebar  structural these are all fields that are overwhelmingly male and this is hardly a comprehensive list i get the distinct impression that nothing hazardous or dangerous ever comes up when discussing this fictional gap because in the west women have it so good they retain the luxury of not even having to think about jobs that can kill them in this issue im suspicious that is the case when the gap comes up hazardous jobs are never mentioned show less,2,NOT
vox this is why i love you,1,NOT
ughhh vox was so close to admitting the wage gap doesnt really exist for sexist reasons so close,2,NOT
wage gap is  cents on the dollar within the margin of error,1,NOT
this is a wonderful video can we get it more views that any of stupid lacy greens videos,1,NOT
so work less get paid less hmmmm,1,NOT
well doesnt that show that the wage gap is not based oh discrimination just job choice and different hours,2,NOT
 ice cream taster sign me up,1,NOT
if women want to close the wage gap become educated in more valuable vocations work as many hours as the highest earning men and dont have children just like how men have no guarantee to have children its solved now do it and stop complaining,2,NOT
its still an indiviual problem if you get less money its because you earn less it dosent matter what your gender is,2,NOT
this gives the information that is needed i am glad that for once vox has given some context to this subject with this proof that they understand the reasons i dont know how you can claim that there is something insidious behind this phenomenon,1,NOT
women are choosing to raise children and thats what is increasing the gap so its their fault yeah ill believe that when paid paternity leave is a thing i guarantee most women who choose to leave their jobs because of giving birth do it because the husband cant get paternity leave make paternity leave a thing and i guarantee the gender wage gap will decrease right now american society basically forces women to leave their jobs unless they already have enough money for private child care and most dont,1,NOT
this conveniently leaves off how men often are demanded of higher hours more risks more time away from family etc the parts where you complain about woman taking more household roles and losing hours tends to be where the men of the family pick up extra hours and more responsibility at work the messed up part is often time woman expect men to do this in families so the men start making way more than the woman and then when there is an apparent pay gap this kind of video gets made saying oh the poor woman are getting paid less complain all you want its just simple woman do less and get paid less and men are being worked to death for that higher pay maybe sometime vox should do something about how men are getting shafted by this trend too,2,NOT
its not factually correct if you have to give so much context its far less deceiving to say that men and women make the same amount per hour on the same job whoops thats wrong too women are being paid more in some jobs on that equivalent scale now but im glad vox gave context even if the video still keeps saying wage gap when there is none when you factor in everything,2,NOT
the devisive thing that people put upon these statistics is that the descriptor and defining factor of wage gap is gender which is completely unfounded this video helps denote that there are so many factors that create such gaps they are logical and make total sense just based on the structure of society,2,NOT
this is correct very good explanation vox but dont call it a wage gap because its an earnings gap two different things,1,NOT
i would watch the whole video or consider it relevant if it wasnt a woman talking,5,ABU
anyone else annoyed by the way she ends every sentence,3,NOT
if there are  genders what wage gap are we talking about,3,NOT
no one mentions the gender spend gap women love to shop and flash hubby  s credit cards while hubby is slogging his guts out at work,3,NOT
female thats a feminist in the raf because they want to enforce equality oh my god this is madness i just joined and im already noticing wage issues im being paid much less than that flight lieutenant whose been in for  years,2,NOT
most women go to collegemost men dont go to college it take a lot to go to college then youre in debt,2,NOT
the weaknesses of the video are as follows they still insinuated that discrimination was a factor as they failed to mention otherwise they didnt talk about wage negotiation they neglected to mention that most women choose to raise children and yes there are studies that give a clear indication that both men and women prefer this to working so it is indeed a privilege for women to do so and perhaps most importantly they failed to mention that these industryspecific differences are literally everything to do with specialisation and earned promotion,2,NOT
jesus its so painful to listen to her vocal fry,2,NOT
youll get paid the same if you do as good a job,2,NOT
this is a very simple explanation of the wage gap i had a hard time understanding before but i can see now how it does exist,1,NOT
good informative video i think something that wasnt mentioned that could affect a womens wage is the likelihood of them taking time off or quiting their job all together i think men get paid more because they are much less likely to be out of work for children for maternity leave from a companys point of view its just more reliable to pick a man to do the job and in a general sense they are a more financially sound choice,1,NOT
feminism is bullshit in my opinion,2,NOT
tldr its not unequal pay for equal work,2,NOT
so sad that women putting children first is now considered an inconvenience and a burden but it does explain part of why the country is getting so messed up,2,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist,2,NOT
there is no wage gap due to sexism if you work hard enough youll make the same,2,NOT
wage gap is more fictional than the sword of sharnana,2,NOT
that footage got lost from both sides maybe a meat industry paid spy stole it,2,NOT
i go through periods of subscribing unsubscribing and resubscribing to you just resubscribed i dont agree with a lot of your motives which is more on me than you due to my severe ed background and mental health activism so any type of video commentary on anothers body sets me off still i always wind up coming back to you because there really is such a sweetness and kindness that just radiates from you i really believe that this is why so many people watch you youre the kind of person that just draws people in i think it would be cool to make a video on junkier vegan foods andor meat alternatives for trisha i know the goal is partly health but i really believe that if she is exposed to just how many delicious vegan chips and pastries and whatever are out there  she may begin to see just how sustainable and restrictive veganism is just a thought  ,1,NOT
thats awesome finally,1,NOT
you dont need to like me you just need to hear me the truth ladies and gentleman,1,NOT

i cant believe it this is amazing,1,NOT
the best way to transition is by purchasing all fake animal products at the beginning then slowly transitioning into the starch solution,1,NOT

freelee you should link her video in the description box ,1,NOT
to the negative vegans in the comment section youre the reason alot of people refuse to go vegan stop assuming stop judging and stop picking at every little thing just shut up and be positive about people being open to veganism the moment you judge little things is the moment we lose people away from veganism be helpful nice positive and encouraging and youll have more wanting to follow like the saying you attract more bees with honey so bee that honey ,2,NOT

im newly vegetarian and going to be making my way into being vegan hopefully within a month some video ideas i would find so helpful is maybe doing an eat this not that video where instead of the classic switching out a high calorie meal for a lower calorie do a classic non vegan meal or food item for a vegan mealfood item also maybe do a video on things that are surprisingly not vegan i never know with some foods thank you,1,NOT

every day we stray further from god,2,NOT
also this entire video is fucking stupid,5,ABU
how can having hair on your lip mean you as a kid look like a man a female child cant look like a manboymaybemanno,2,NOT
okay trisha you identify as a female you literally said you identify as your naturalborn gender which is female shut the fuck up with your transphobic bullshit oh no you had to wear sports bras  bitch shut up that doesnt make you trans at all youre a tomboy you literally have no dysphoria you have your fucking tits out the entire fucking time you have more male characteristics oh you dont wanna be the center of attention  that doesnt fucking make you trans girls dont have to wear makeup or do their hair to be a girl im a trans guy and i fucking hate this video so much just because youre into gay guys doesnt make you a guy let me say this again you are not a man so many people have opposite sex envy and they arent trans im sure a lot of girls especially ones going through puberty envy men because itll make their life easier thats not what dysphoria is dysphoria is not opposite sex envy dysphoria is wanting the opposite sex because itll match their gender gender dysphoria is a legitimate mental thing genderfluid doesnt exist some gay men date ftm people and dont have a problem with having sex with them despite their female parts because they dont have gynophobia some gay men do have gynophobia but thats not my point my point is that you are not transgender you are a cisgender female coming from a real trans guy you experience little to no gender dysphoria i apologize for being so rude im normally not and i normally try to have a rational and respectful conversation but im so pissed at this a lot of people dont like their given name not all of them are trans you really need to get the idea that youre even remotely considering being trans you were happy with short hair because you dont like the responsibility of having long hair most real trans guys want short hair because thats typically masculine masculinity does not equal male femininity does not equal female you can be a feminine boy or a masculine girl your attraction does not have anything to do with your genderidentity unless your attraction to men being ftm but not knowing makes you feel gay or vice versa that would be the only instance that attraction affects identity when youre trans ftm you dont have a male side because you are male you are not male you are not a gay man seriously dont identify as trans or come out unless youve seen a licensed gender therapist and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria yes you actually have to be diagnosed in most places you need an official diagnosis to go on hormones or just medically transition in any way but of course you cant medically transition because youll just develop dysphoria because youre transitioning to something that you think you wantare but really you dontarent please spare yourself the time energy hate and dysphoria and shut up get the idea out of your head that youre even remotely trans please,5,ABU
why cant u just be a girl that likes gay guys and big butts on girls i dont see a problem there,2,NOT
support my page please much love,1,NOT
gurl ure not trans,2,NOT
trish do you always gotta be an ass,3,NOT
theres a huge difference in acting masculine and being more comfortable with men and being trans this is glamorizing being trans who go through actually social and mental dysphoria this is taking one of the dudes too far trish i think your confusing attraction and personality with being trans,2,NOT
ive supported you through a lot of stupid shit but you lost me with this please educate yourself youre about to get dragged,2,NOT
sooooooo youre a tomboy i think society has worn you down with you have to do your hair and makeup to look decent to the point where you just want to be you which i understand but to say youre transgender because you dont want to do your hair and makeup is insane,1,NOT
please see a doctor who can help you,2,NOT
i dont know why youre all so shook the other month she was an opiate addict and somehow made an overnight recovery from withdrawal tomorrow she will probably say that shes related to the queen and that she had an incest relationship with prince harry,2,NOT
hey trish its the trans community picking up the phone were disconnecting the line bitch,5,ABU
whats the big deal just let her say or be whatever she wants  dafuq you dont have to understand,1,NOT
wait  trisha is transgender,1,NOT
okay girl thats called being gender fluid and the only thing you are relating too as a guy is ur lack of hygiene,2,NOT
well congrats you got the views you wanted,1,NOT
this is probably my favourite video youve ever made,1,NOT
gender fluid definitely not transgender im sorry,1,NOT
i support you but im completely lost,1,NOT
what that feeling is called is wanting views money and controversy this so awful to people who are really deeply struggling with actually transitioning,2,NOT
i feel like she just has a borderline dissociative disorder where shes kinda created a male alter but still has somewhat of a grip on her female original identity sense of reality,2,NOT
how to you offend an entire community from your title to your thumbnail to the first second of your video to the last and then say i dont want people to be offended btch what,2,NOT
jesus fucking christ wtf,3,NOT
gets breast implants nails hair extensions etc lol,2,NOT
im transgender and this is super offensive,1,NOT
you say youre trans but then go and say that theythem pronouns are confusing and you associate it with multiple personality issues wtf this video is so insulting to trans people who are just always the butt if the joke and you are contributing to transphobia culture,2,NOT
move to utah theres loads of gay mormon guys hiding as straight men youll love them,2,NOT
i can already feel the backlash of this video,1,NOT
i think she should identify as a cow,3,NOT
nobody absolutely nobody trishaim attracted to gay men therefore im a gay man,2,NOT
the cis white lady privilege and ignorance jumped out,2,NOT
isnt this the same as straight men that fetishize lesbians,1,NOT
u identify as a girl but are a gay man huh,1,NOT
trisha i dont like labels also trisha im transgender,2,NOT
literally the most toxic human being alive,5,ABU
what the actual fuck is she trying to say  girl are you trying to get yourself canceled youre making the trans community look so bad ,2,NOT
i love you mom ,1,NOT
im attracted to only men  min later i have come out as gay and bi me,2,NOT
please dont try and dictate the lgbt community when you clearly just seem confused and make a mockery of trans people,2,NOT
lol okay trisha go play with your imaginary dragon children and be a chicken nugget again,3,NOT
i have never been so confused in my life what the actual hell is going on,2,NOT
what your describing doesnt sound like trans at all sounds more like gender nonconforming or nonbinary,1,NOT
you know what i would call this a tom boy somtimes and a girl girl sometimes because what i heard was you like man hair and being a little more guy ish but maybe thats just me i hope you can figure it out t i really hope you find someone you care about and they care and except you ,1,NOT
     guys what is up,1,NOT
well if you feel girly some days and like a boy other days then you might be genderfluid basically how i can explain it is sometimes you feel like a girl and other times you feel like a boy,1,NOT
i didnt like getting attention from adults as a child so im trans,1,NOT
so your basically non binary,1,NOT
ok i think its safe to say that she is  not going to therapy anymore get back on the couch youre not trans youre just an idiot with a drug addiction and a go pro and that everyone is a dangerous combination,5,ABU
someone should let her go on t and see how she reacts to being a real man,2,NOT
love you girl hope you can figure out what you feel in yourself soon,1,NOT
trish i just dont get theythem also trish uses they to describe a singular person in the same video,2,NOT
yall im confused ,1,NOT
she has too much time on her hands,2,NOT
u can be female and still be a tomboy that doesnt make you a man,2,NOT
i think trisha is trying to figure herself out maybe not the best wayright way but i can tell shes conflicted with her internal and physical self hope she figures it out,1,NOT
second hand retardation hitting me hard rn,3,NOT
maybe you have body dysmorphia  youre tomboy or youre androgynous,1,NOT
as a trans guy myself i think theres a huge difference than being trans and not really feeling like a woman i personally cant speak on your feelings but j think you need to do you reserch so many people who think theyre trans but arent because of other issues that they believe could be fixed my being different gender for instance you being attracted to gay men doesnt mean your a gay guy you just happened to be attracted to some of the qualities they have i think that its awesome to try out new pronouns and to experiment but i dont believe in just going straight in and coming out as a trans guys i think one thing for me that really makes me confused about this is the fact that youve gotten multiple breast jobs to enhance your boobs as a trans guy that would absolutely kill me you can obviously do whatever you want and i hope you well in your transition but i think you need to do way more reserch and figure out if you want to become a man not just a drag queen,1,NOT
sorry to say but a person who uses theythem pronouns are called non binary people i am a non binary person my self and i appreciate people to use my correct pronouns,1,NOT
hunter avalone any thoughts,1,NOT
officially convinced shes loosing it,2,NOT
but also a drag queen drag queen is not a gender and anyone of any gender no matter cis or trans can be drag queens,1,NOT
i identify as male wears acrylic nails wears makeup grows out hair super long and complains about her boobs honey if you want to get it fixed you have the money and your not trans your just most likely a tomboy and i am transgender,2,NOT
just because you had short hair it doesnt make you a man,2,NOT
i choose to identify as a male ,2,NOT
shes so dumb bye,3,NOT
so she said you dont have to identify as female or male but also said they or whatever is confusing they pronouns are valid  please educate yourself  signed everyone watching,2,NOT
no baby no that dont make no sense ,2,NOT
how the hell is shane handling this,2,NOT
shes a human who likes to do drag as a male,1,NOT
ummm so what im getting is you are pansexual and you are not sure what you are in terms of gender,1,NOT
she didnt mention gender dismorphia once,1,NOT
wait i kinda understand this but maybe its bc im high,1,NOT
she needs some milk,1,NOT
fuck you trisha exploiting trans people for views is so fucking low you dont know shit about what we go through on a daily basis this video is really hurtful and cruel for anyone to even think about making this shit makes me sick fucking fuck you  i never leave comments but this time i couldnt stop myself,5,ABU
next week shell be on t,1,NOT
 trisha and i and i me oop,1,NOT
well i dont wear makeup on a regular basis i guess that i identify as a male now,2,NOT
am i transgender yes do i identify as my my birth gender female yes me bitch the fuck,5,ABU
sooooooooo b a s i c a l l y trish is having a james charles type of shishtar scandal and is attracted to gay men so shes covering it up by saying she herself is a transgender gay man so its okay for her to like gay men plot twist her husband is a gay man and so shes making this vid right before the wedding as her explanation for why its okay,2,NOT
this bitch is so full of shit she cant even keep eye contact with the camera  can we just all stop watching this crazy bitch  i feel bad for her to be honest ,5,ABU
coming from a genderfluid person to me it sounds like she might be genderfluid or maybe nonbinary also people using the pronoun they dont have disassociate personality disorder i use theythem pronouns personally for several reasons  it feels a lot more neutral to me and i prefer that sometimes people using her and he make me feel highly uncomfortable and i know its not right so i use theythem because i feel like it fits me more also they is used as a singular pronoun a lot in english when you dont know someones gender you use theythem like if someone said oh its my friends birthday today a perfectly normal response would be oh tell them i said happy birthday ergo theythem can be used as a singular pronoun and a lot of people feel more comfortable with that and thats aokay,1,NOT
actually fuck yourself youre female in every single way you are not trans you do not have gender dysphoria i am so insulted by this as a real transgender man you have zero masculinity which is needed to be female to male ask a doctor educated on the human brain or gender identities and they will say you are born with a male or female brain you were born with a female brain and everyone sees that you are far too old to be doing this shit with the amount of people who know you it is so wrong to be posting this it is wrong to allow anyone to think being transgender is even  a choice jesus please delete your channel,5,ABU
no trisha none of this makes any sense its offensive and gross that u exploit these topics for views stop it,2,NOT
it kinda sounds like non binary  from the way she talks and non binary falls under the transgender umbrella,1,NOT
me explaining something to my mom that she questioned about,1,NOT
trish i have always loved and supported u but this is like so much as a pansexual trans man u cant just claim to be trans even tho  seconds later u say ur cis also singular theythem pronouns are completely valid if u are having confusing thoughts about gender and identity u need to figure ur shit out before u talk about it publicly bc rn u have no idea what ur talking about also someone doesnt have to have surgeries to be a man or a woman the person themselves desides if surgery is a thing they want to feel more comfortable pls do research figure ur shit out,2,NOT
so this whole video shes saying shes ftm but everything she explains is the explanation of a person who nonbinary,1,NOT
people reacted the same way when gigi came out as a lesbian fuck the haters be you,1,NOT
its good youre exploring and finding out who you are but please talk to a gender specialist before doing anything major,1,NOT
wait hold up how do you identify as ur natural born gender and then be trans like ur born a female and you said you identify as that but in every other part of the video you say you dont ,2,NOT
ugh whats next trisha coming out as a person of colour,2,NOT
if i asserted myself i wouldnt be a bitch id be the man i see trisha made it to track  of lover and decided she felt that shit real deep,2,NOT
like i am trans and some transphobic person sent this to me and he ligit said this is why the transgender community is gross and its all just a faze so like wow,1,NOT
im trans and not confused but you sure are sis,1,NOT
being transgender isnt a game ,1,NOT
comments are lame get better jokes,1,NOT
forget the clown youre literally the whole damn circus ,2,NOT
trisha dresses up as troy bolton on instagram trisha i am man,2,NOT
being insecure about the size of your boobs and your facial hair does not make you trans being friends with guys and not being friends with as many girls does not make you trans not wearing makeup does not make you trans not liking unsolicited sexual advances from men does not make you trans being assertive does not make you trans,2,NOT
what a fucking trainwreck sorry to all of the transgender people out there,5,ABU
being a man is just easier being trans isnt for your convenience its not a choice and your demeaning trans people and the use of theythem please educate yourself,2,NOT

what would yall do if she went to doctors and whatnot and got diagnosed with real gender dysphoria,1,NOT
cant wait for the waterworks in the next video bois,1,NOT
i just cant follow im just confused i love trisha and i just hope she can figure her brain out,1,NOT
thats gender fluid sis,1,NOT
take the ads off if you are truly sincere,1,NOT
whatttt im very confused,1,NOT
wouldnt this just be androgynous or nonbinary,1,NOT
i wear sports bras to flatten my chest trisha i wanna look fake with huge tits also trisha,2,NOT
you need to seriously educate yourself before making a video like this unless you have dysphoria you are not transgender not all transgender people got through the whole transitionmeaning surgery most can socially and hormonally transition and that is enough you need therapy and education you are offending true transgender people by saying you are  female and ok yet are transgender this is a joke you dont have dysphoria therefore you are not transgender,2,NOT
trish i love you but i dont think your transgender or whatever like you said you have male energy sometimes just like other women do not all women are girly girls just be trish,1,NOT
i think i got what u got boo,1,NOT
we do not claim her,2,NOT
kalvin garrah where you at,1,NOT
so obviously someones gender identity is not something i can decide for them so i generally give people the benefit of the doubt now if they had said something along the lines of im a demiperson and not i like feminine guys lolz obviously im a gay man it would have maybe made sense as it is im losing more and more brain cells by the second watching this,2,NOT
so shes gender fluid,1,NOT
she doesnt like attention fjcjishfhdjsjd,1,NOT
dumb as fuck,5,ABU
though as a member of the lgbt i was very offended by this video i think its truly immoral to be so negative towards trish i hope to god that she isnt trolling we are all aware of the strength it takes to come out as trans so if this is who trish really is then instead of shaming we should be taking this opportunity to educate and explain why what was said in this video is erroneous i would also recommend finding a new gender therapist if the concept of dysphoria hasnt come up in conversation or the fact that drag queen or gay isnt on the gender spectrum then perhaps that is contributing to the confusion good luck on your journey trish,1,NOT
wait what i mean i support trish in whatever trish wants i hope this brings you happiness,1,NOT
doesnt like makeup guess im a guy i,1,NOT
trish i love you but i think youre just confused if you actually do feel this way then just give it time to be sure,1,NOT
i understand this completely if you dont understand dont shun her its not her fault if you cant rap your head around it,1,NOT
i think gender fluid might be something you should research a bit not saying your current label is wrong or anything just sounds like similar to what you are explaining,1,NOT
is born a female turns into a male turns back into a female god ,2,NOT
this is soooooo wrong take this down,2,NOT
trisha your description sounds like a nonbinary person to me,1,NOT
tbh me trying to understand how i feel about my life,1,NOT
im female but i have a lot of guy friends cuss a lot and i like to tell dirty jokes does that mean im trans foh shes crazy she seems to be pretty comfortable in her own skin,2,NOT
wtf is up with you,2,NOT
i cant believe this bitch got a mermaids ad but actually dysphoric and transition trans youtubers dont get ads,5,ABU
what the actual fuck is wrong with you you have crossed into waters that you need to back track real quick out of this whole video is a fucking mess your explaining is a mess trans people are not confused but by god you are you put on a wig for a week and like gay men so now your suddenly saying your trans what the fuck trisha you explained being gender fluid you clearly have some more thinking to do fuck am i and most likely the rest of the community highly offended by this complete and utter bullshit,5,ABU
dont know why im here but i cant stop watching this train wreck ,2,NOT
someoneplease make it make sense,1,NOT
trish all u said are personality traits enjoying glam stuff doesnt make you a girl or a boy its just you being you,1,NOT
i think shes trying to explain nonbinary,1,NOT
i love the trans community gee thanks cause now this video makes us look bad ,2,NOT
okay but think about ur future partner if you wanna date a straight guy and they get confused about ur gender and you tell them that then theyll get very confused and it might not work out,2,NOT
this is offensive honestly offensive you can be a dominant masculine female and not be trans you need to be educated on what the fuck dysphoria is before you start to claim you have it in reality you do not you dont know how it feels to be trapped in the wrong body you only know how it feels to be teased for being more masculine and accepting that you are your attraction to gay guys has nothing to do with you being trans thats a fetish you are obviously confused and please go talk to a therapist or maybe kalvin garrah because he knows his shit you need to be educated you do not know your facts or what youre talking about,2,NOT
oh honey no please please please educate yourself before making a public video if you really are trans than i support you  but you really need to get your facts straight first maybe seek some council from the trans community i hope your prepared for some major backlash from this video hun not judging or bullyingjust trying to warn ya,2,NOT
so your gender fluid,1,NOT
the language u use to describe relationships with trans people is really problematic i believe u when you say you are trans but please learn some more things and try to not just talk about this stuff in an improvised fashion a lot of your gender theory is based around traditional gender roles which is exactly what being trans is not about look into genderfluid and genderqueer identities please talk to more trans people,1,NOT
everyone is hating and the only reason i watched this is because my friend was hating on it but i feel like i relate to this so much i love you t,1,NOT
youre such a joke,2,NOT
as someone who is transgender i think you are confusing being ftm transgender with thinking that life would be easier as a man theres a big difference you need to go see a therapist to work through these feelings rather than sharing it on social media,1,NOT
the little tiny shred of respect i had for her was just destroyed  wtf is wrong with her,2,NOT
tbh she couldve just done a mukbang and then just poked about this and then never really talked about it again,1,NOT
everyone disliked that,2,NOT
this was handled so disrespectfully coming from a trans person doesnt mean trish has to be cis but this was not handled respectfully jesus,2,NOT
i think i actually understand you not saying that i relate but i understand what you are trying to say trish what youre talking about is called gender fluidity you can be gender fluid it sounds like you are just learning and exploring about this so embrace your gender fluidity and learn more about it you have a lot to learn before you can not offend anyone please continue to educate yourself,1,NOT
t or trish u do u why are people hating when it doesnt affect their lives unsubscribe if its that big of a deal hope your having a great tour,1,NOT
oh no honey,1,NOT
im confusedis she female or male i dont understand,1,NOT
im gay most of my friends are gay hella accepting but damn maybe she just worded this horribly wrong,2,NOT
  take your own advice,1,NOT
to be any gender on any day is basically being gender fluid im personally gender fluid and i go by hehim theythem pronouns but i dont identify as transgender if anything i acknowledge that sometimes being fluid feels like im constantly transitioning because i dont have a fixed gender but i am not trans its just some food for thought but i support you wanting to express your masculinity and whatever way that may be,1,NOT
damn tryna get attention dont even know wtf she says cause the things she say dont make sense at all ,2,NOT
based on the things that she says in this video i believe that she may be genderqueer in some way however this video is in very poor taste and incredibly poorlyinformed i really wish she had handled it better especially since she has the responsibility of having a platform,2,NOT
im not even a trans but this feels too offensive to me,1,NOT
this video is hella problematic transphobic homophobic the whole shebang,1,NOT

as a trans man fuck you,5,ABU
being vegan for  and a half years best years of my life never turn back lets save our planet thank you for such a great film,1,NOT
so if i understand correctly because you dont wear a lot of makeup in real life and youre not overly feminine youre a guy  you are not a male because you do not identify with femininityfemale gender roles female societal expectations and saying otherwise is crazy harmful gender  sex honestly the more i think about it the more im realising radical feminists have the right idea when it comes to understanding sexgender if you identify with a gender thats different to your own so in this case masculinity instead of femininity you should work to dismantle gender norms to make it so a female can do traditionally masculine things likenot wearing makeup without it being weird your sex and identity arent the problem and you shouldnt work on changing either so it matches whatever gender roles you want to follow again the implications of doing this are crazy i dont understand why a right winger saying females makeup is sexist but somehow wrapping the same talking point in leftist mumbo jumbo is all of a sudden progressiveor take use another example you gave i feel male because im assertive progressive im not even mad at you trish we live in a society thats so binary that its very normal to feel the way you feel but i hope you realise soon that you are not a male just because you dont  percent behave the way you are expected to as a female youre just normal noone identifies with their gendergender roles  percent editive just finished the vid and i think the issue here is that the female form is very sexualised by the male gaze and i think in many ways presenting as a male  short hair binding wearing baggy clohes is a way for you to evade that very sexualised perception of your self by men the freedom you feel by presenting as a man makes sense as youve said males are free from the expectation to wear makeup we dont have to do our hair we dont get looked at it or hit on by weird sleazy dudes sending you lots of love it probably isnt at all to feel what youre feeling and i hope all the people attacking you take a step back and realise how normal it is for you to feel the way you feel as a woman in society like oursthe male gaze is toxic af,2,NOT
oh my god shut the fuck up delete this,3,NOT
this is just offensive to everything lol,2,NOT
is is this real,2,NOT
im a gay guy because im attracted to gay guys so if a gay guy is attracted to a straight guy is he a straight girl,2,NOT
only came to dislike,2,NOT
ok im not even halfway through the video yet and i already know that youre just lost and very very confused which is okay i was confused about being trans at the beginning too so i dont wanna jump to conclusions and just criticize you now i just really think you should do a little more research on the matter maybe talking to some trans people as well and see where it goes and how you feel about all of it you know good luck,1,NOT
trishahas a boy haircut in her music vid nobody trisha i am non binary transgender drag queen male,2,NOT
the hell is this clown shit,2,NOT
this aint it sis,2,NOT
im so sorry you have to deal with all this hate youtube is vicious and im sorry theyll never understand you t sexuality and gender is more fluid than you think its okay to explore yourself to try on different labels or even give them up entirely i wish this world was more accepting of differences and nonconformity but its just not and whoever reads this i dont care what youve seen or how youve justified your actions you cant say with honesty that hate and making fun is a good thing belittling someone when theyre pouring out their soul no matter how foolish you think it sounds is a good thing making not only t but other viewers who are struggling with their own identity feel like absolute crap is a good thing when you spread hate and intolerance into this world its on you thats your fault thats your soul being chipped away at and i hope one day you can overcome your mistakes and spread positivity instead,2,NOT
im more confused watching this than she is with her identity,2,NOT
remember when she identified as a chicken nugget,2,NOT
i think i get what ur saying like u feel like a feminine man and that fine i honestly think most of the people are giving u crap cause they dont understand you and no one really understands someone elses dysphoria and them wanting to transition i support you amd i really hope you find your true self without all the hate cause you really dont need that good luck t,1,NOT
looks like hh broke her,2,NOT
conclusion a  minute video of her saying ,2,NOT
ok but wtf,2,NOT
people dont have to understand for you to be valid i hope you dont take the ignorant comments on this video to heart much love and keep doing what makes you happy ,1,NOT
everyone defending her is acting like we dont know whats going on but uh am i transgender  do i identify with my birth gender  thats literally all we need to know to say shes not trans,2,NOT

i understand ,1,NOT
im happy for you ,1,NOT
im confused she says that she was born a female but she identifies as a boy but she looks completely like a girl,2,NOT
i think everyone should just stop saying anything in the comments ya the video is complicated af but shes also human and she should be able to call her self identity or think of her self as anything and should be able to feel comfortable saying anything when its talking about her mental state of mind we support anyone else in the world when it comes to these kinds of things so why can we not support her ya shes know for a lot of scandals online but that shouldnt effect youre output on anyone when it comes to there feelings,1,NOT

trish i had hair on my body during puberty therefore shes a man,2,NOT
yall who r putting out the negative comments your all fake fans  just sayin ,2,NOT
the fact that she made an apology video but left this up shows that she isnt sorry at all the fucked up part is i really dont think she has bad intentions i think she is just selfsabotaging selfinvolved and socially unaware but the road to hell is paved with good intentions and even if she somehow justified this in her mind as meaning no harm there is no excuse for ignorance of this level this video is just so tone deaf it gives me a headache and i truly hope she figures herself out off camera ,2,NOT
my theory is either she doesnt feel like shes getting enough attention or her self esteem issues are so intense that shes beyond confused,2,NOT
so i saw a video were she said she didnt believe egipt was a real place like she really is very stupid geez,3,NOT
this is really offensive in the worse way this is not humor please seek help and think about what youre doing ,2,NOT

um sis i love you and all but this dont make sense im confused like what are you a boy or girli dont think you can be both and what is this saying about jason he isnt gayright,2,NOT
here after the did video my first reaction after watching both videos and after not watching any of her videos in yeaaaarrrs is what the actual fuckbut honestly this makes me so sad there is obviously something really wrong with her she has absolutely no idea who she is or where she belongs and this in it self is a problem  most likely started when she was a child as much as we all want to hate on her the poor girl is literally losing her mind in front of millions and making millions in the process its a vicious and unfulfilling circle and i hope the people who actually care for her will keep an eye on her,2,NOT
anyone else just hate her lips but cant stop looking at them,3,NOT
as an ftm gay man who is also a drag queen this is one of the most offensive things ive ever seen,2,NOT

i think your just confused trish mental breakdown girrrrl,2,NOT
not to force a label on you but it sounds more like you are identifying with gender nonbianry or gender fluidneutral you can feel femminie one day and want short boyish hair the next day and thats fine trans isnt quite the definition i would use personally maybe just gender nonconforming you can identify as those and not use theythem use any pronouns you prefer have people call you heher if you like but trans is a different thing entirely from what you are describing here also saying you are basically a drag queen does not make you trans some drag queenskings are trans some are not some are straight some are gay some are other things drag queen does not always equal trans,1,NOT
sis just because you hate your name and you like short hair better doesnt mean youre a boy cut your hair and chill for a minute,2,NOT
oh no here we go again,2,NOT
having a bad experience being a woman does not mean ur transgender dude being a woman is tuff we get a lot of shit we have to deal w so much that men dont have to so i get wanting to escape being a woman but i think this stems from a place of self hatred and self esteem issues rather than being transgender i think youd feel so sad and lost if you transitioned my  cents xoxo,1,NOT

i think she confused gender roles with biological sex so doesnt realize that you can be nonbinary xd having gender disphoria is a lot different then not wanting to conform to a gender role or not wanting to identify as any gender at all,1,NOT
girl take better care of your skin,2,NOT

this is some transphobic bs,1,NOT

i feel like she doesnt really know what being trans is thought the video she took different stereotypes about women and when she didnt conform to them said i must be a man just bc you try to be assertive and dont like wearing makeup all the time doesnt mean ur trans,1,NOT
everyone bashing her cos shes attention seeking which she is yet its the same people that advocate for people being whatever gender you feel regardless of the reasons she can identify as a man if she wants i dont give a flying fck just find it ironic,1,NOT

fortunately most people are becoming accepting of the reality of the fact that we take life solely to fulfill our greediness though there are still those emotional whiny carcass crunchers that double down in their ignorance lmao those are the people that would have been slave owners back in the day same exact mentality and just like before natural selection will weed those less aware individuals out as society progresses without them,2,NOT

as a new vegan but long time observer of history climate change and veganism being paired together is a dangerous idealism elites have long wanted to establish a technocratic control grid an internet of all things in order to achieve this they have ridden the coattails of the veganism movement to help push it down the pipes going plant based as a protest and shift on mass ag is great but media is shoving climate change a whole other beast down our collective throats tread carefully through this inspired film peace,1,NOT

am  years old and live in texas i live in a household of meat eaters and i personally ive been pescatarian for about  to  months i recently made the switch to vegetarianism and i really really really really really really really really really really want to be vegan i couldve made the switch instantly a yr ago to plant based but it wouldve been too hard on my family which is whats keeping me from it now it is tough considering my family torments criticizes and teases me about my lifestyle choices my family is proud and supportive of me even if it may seem otherwise and helps me afford tofu extra produce and etc along with monthly doctoral check ups since i am an avid athlete both in volleyball and school sports i try to cut out dairy whenever i possibly can i substitute milks cheeses yogurts and etc for the plantbased versions and it is more accessible considering my mom is dairy intolerant so i practically am vegan i am very mature for my age and try toeducate myself on the topic pretty regularly i have seen all documentaries i know of on pbn netflix and a surplus on youtube i dont think my family fully grasps the logistics of veganism i have tried numerous times to get my family to watch documentaries with me but repeatedly have been bombarded with nos and attacks on my lifestyle choices when in reality all im trying to do is to help educate and inform my family about their daily choices and to help them understand my perspective my dad has made numerous comments saying you only eat grass or you need to actually do research when all my dad has done is listened to a few podcasts of biased farmers i eventually tracked my mom into watching the game changers with me on netflix by telling her it was a documentary based on athletes which is partially true but it ended up practically pointless because she fell asleep  minutes into the movie i have tried numerous times since then to have her watch some with me but and i quote  i dont want to watch cute little animals die as an answer which proves she knows what she does on an everyday basis is morally environmentally ethically and for health reasons is wrong it frustrates the crap out of me for goodness sake shes freaking dietitian especially for diabetes which is caused by oh you guessed it the saturated fat and cholesterol is animal products ughhhhhhhhhhh please help me what can i do any suggestions to help me convince my parents my point of view to watch a documentary anything pleaseeeeeeeeeeee oh ps pbn i was literally waiting for so long for this documentary to come out and when i saw it in my suggestionshome page i said skrew sleep im watching this lol,1,NOT

well the only problem is many peoply replace the meat with stuff made of soy all in all good except millions of squaremiles of rainforest gets incinerated to plant soy there and when the soil is deploited they have to incinerate a new piece of forest to get new land for their agriculture and the dead soil they leave behind doesnt get enough time to recover and becomes a degradated forest we cant continue this th rainforest is the biggest carbondioxide storage of our planet and destroying it sets all this carbondioxide free to damage our climate even more if we want to save the planet soy isnt a choice even though of course most of the soy isnt even consumed by the human we still have to care about where the stuff we consume comes from,1,NOT
of course the meat eaters react negatively eating meat makes them more confrontational using the reptilian brain that was not part of our original dna but put there the vegan has overcome that and shut it down we need to be careful to not fuel that divide and conquer mentality we need to stay calm and focused feeding this planet our higher vibrations so in turn we can liberate mother earth,2,NOT

veganismplantbased eating is the only thing that makes sense for health and specity humanity  all living species but to use the climatefanaticism in this is a big mistake as there is not humancaused cobased climate problem worth talking about  we could talk about pollution  all the shit that does not include co  and which seems to have been forgotten completely in the cofrenzy that is a huge problem co is a greenhouse gas in the sense that it makes everything grow faster ask anybody with a professional greenhouse operation and hence greening the planet  but since it is heavier than air  and always will fall down ever heard about gravity  and cannot hold heat it does not cause any traditional greenhouse effect when the grand solar minimum is cooling the planet dangerously and the whole global warming thing is debunked finally  it may take the whole vegan movement with it  which would be a disaster for the reasons mentioned above,2,NOT

im a longtime advocate of whole plantbased diet and im very supportive of anything that gets large portions of the population to make the switch away from animal products however the attitude toward food and diet and what we associate it with needs to change as well food and diet should be viewed primarily as a component of health and hygiene instead we are all too often associating food with pleasure celebration and entertainmentwhich also includes all vices such as alcohol tobacco illegal drugs gambling pornography casual sexual encounters and many other hedonistic obsessions that are all harmful to health in the longrun people eating some of these new plantbased substitutes for burgers sausages and other animal foods are holding on to their traditional sources of pleasure i also agree that we need to eliminate animal farming for various reasons including environmental protection but again it is folly to believe this will solve the problems we face with pollution and climate warming the only solution that will ever have a chance of saving us from ourselves if it isnt already too late is to dramatically downsize human impact on the planet and that can only happen by an equally dramatic downsizing of the global population unless that happens and happens consistently and fairly quickly we are toastall the other efforts to reverse climate change will not be sufficient not even close,1,NOT

not a bad documentary and im really happy that it doesnt only highlights the positive side but also talks about possible arguments against veganism and disproves them afterwards but ive got the feeling that its mostly focussing on the economical part although i think it would be much more beneficial to shed light on the concrete impacts on our environment i see the focus here mostly on famous representatives of the vegan communities and less on the actual reasons why people should go vegan nevertheless i think it is awesome that youtube has now free documentaries as well and that even the ones without netflix can inform themselves about the plantbased diet,1,NOT

vox is propaganda pay gap is myth companies would only hire women if this was true,2,NOT
wait doesnt vox spout bullshit but this is all true,2,NOT
i thought jfk passed an equal pay bill,1,NOT
inequality for rich people so sad doesnt it just break your heart,2,NOT
one of the jobs was lion tamer,1,NOT
within a healthy balanced diet a man needs around kj kcal a day to maintain his weight for a woman that figure is around kj kcal a day so a man earns more money since he has to eat more than a woman makes sense to me,3,NOT
wow it took you years to acknowledge that the pay gap is a myth and that perpetuating lies may hurt your image your arrogance knows no bounds by the way youre not fooling anyone anyone with even half a brain knows youll lie about anything for as long as you can get away with it,3,NOT
im not sure why everyone is complaining about their wages like im triggered because an apache attack tomatoe tomahtoe like me gets nothing   we need money to ,1,NOT
even  isnt good enough its gotta be ,1,NOT
the wage gap is false men are more likely to go to work sick while women are more likely to call in sick and lots of time call in sick a couple days a month because its that time again and men are more likely to work overtime this is statistics not sexisim,2,NOT
you make it sound like all women resent being mothers and its a chore to be a mom,1,NOT
k is not  of k,1,NOT
also you have to look at the total reality who has to buy the house car who pays for the dates and vacations who pays for all the bullshit the woman and the kids want who pays for child support and alimony while the female just gets on welfare and gets free handouts that will further justify the wages gap,2,NOT
wow im surprised vox made a video on this very impressed,1,NOT
  men earn  but women earn  less at  thats  as much not  less which would be ,1,NOT
i liked most of this video it does acknowledge women make more housework and less hours but youve presented this as something that needs to be shrinked thats honestly not true,2,NOT
theres already laws that make paying women less illegal and you can sue companies for doing so so why arent you taking them to court and why do you think another piece of paper reiterating a law already in place is going to do anything dumbass,3,NOT
people have such weird ideologies,2,NOT
thanks for telling me what to think vox,1,NOT
so basically its more of the various inconveniences that come with strict work hours than it is about sexism like the media makes it out to be this is extremely interesting,2,NOT
i honestly believe that a job that requires extreme physical labor should amount to the same pay as a job that requires extreme mental labor both forms of jobs are used to service the world and if one were to not exist we wouldnt have a sustainable world i believe that gaps exist in both experience and that experience compared to mental vs physical i really dont think that a construction worker gets as much as a surgeon however both jobs are important one can save a life or give new life and the other can build homes for that life to live in,2,NOT
so the gender wage gap has nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with personal choices it cracked me up that at the end she suggested we need to change jobs that reward working long hours because women dont tend to choose to work long hours what we really need to do is accept that its ok for men to earn more as long as its simply a result of their decision to be more dedicated to their work,2,NOT
did vox just disprove the gender wage gap vox,1,NOT
more flexible hours two birds with one stone i like it,1,NOT
if the argument is that women spend more time taking care of children the solution would not be to make flexible hours for them its to let men take paternal leave if you give them flexible hours it only incentivizes businesses to pay them less,1,NOT
 says that my old highschool is just conveniently ignoring this video we at one point spent and entire hour talking about how men are payed more than woman and completely ignored the fact that it is illegal to pay someone more or less based on sex race etc if i could go back with the knowledge i have now i could easily disprove them but sadly at the time i still thought the crazy ones were just feminazis and not the whole feminism movement as a whole,3,NOT
wait people still believe in the wage gap myth this has been debunked more times than i can remember and anyone who spends more than  seconds thinking about it will realize why on average men work more hours and work in the higher paying and more dangerous fields omg sexism men make up  of workplace deaths omg omg omgomg sexism if men complained as much as feminists,2,NOT
didnt expect this from vox,1,NOT
on the people who say it dosent exist you are sorta right if you factor out childbearing it disappears the wage gap is evidence of gender roles that negatively impact people,1,NOT
if women want to make as much as men go get a job on an oil rig get a job working on an electoral lines get a job in a coal mine become an iron worker become an electrician become a wielder become an petroleum engineering get into building trade and construction careers become an mechanical engineers become a rocket scientists become a machinist become a brick layer become a roofer study in a stem field etc etc etc this does not happen very often because women make different choices the main reason they become the most important job ever a mom,2,NOT
wage gap is completely bullshit,2,NOT
copied from chris does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didnt watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work eg business this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men  women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesnt account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from    men earned more out the gate  its a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from  all the way back to  i mean really  the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their s and s was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument  if you look at women born  same thing for women    if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument   these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women arent payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument   if you dont show up for work or cant work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesnt have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her  i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in  so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women arent paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they werent but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women the simple answer is no btw i cited every source i could in your video every point i made has your quotes and even the video times you quoted a lot of studies is it that hard too add them too the description,2,NOT
there are a few things not included vacation time amount of total hours worked hard labor and also how taking leave affects ones future pay by the way most of what affects pay in higher end jobs is pay negotiated by employee and employers,2,NOT
so if women would choose to work crappy hours like men choose to work crappy hours theyll make almost the same holy cow what a concept,2,NOT
omg weve entered retardville,3,NOT
its not a question about it shrinking or what it is its still a gap and still is something we have to fix,1,NOT
in this comment section youll find teenage boys who didnt watch the whole video and blindly associate wage gap with tumblr feminism ,1,NOT
why are there so many dislikes lol,1,NOT
back when vox made good videos,1,NOT
women make less because they decide to make less more then men,3,NOT
vox great video,1,NOT
you know what would be nice a video about some form of equality that isnt about the us,1,NOT
to be honest this was boring asf,2,NOT
wage gap is proven biased,2,NOT
maybe shes a venture capitalist lolololoolol,1,NOT
please provide sources to first prove it exists,1,NOT
whwhat people who actually understand the wage gap,1,NOT
i see more triggered men in the comments than feminists lmao,2,NOT
vox is so stupid that they disprooved the myth gap and they dont accept it,2,NOT
its not our fault men work more,2,NOT
i think you are all missing the important issue here where do i apply for professional stick figure artist,1,NOT
there is no gender wage gap there is an earnings gap which is to do with hours job type skill level offtime qualifications etc not gender all it shows is that men earn more because they either have a higher paying job have more hours have less offtime have a larger skill set and thus promotion andor more qualifications,2,NOT
i should stop hating this i feel like i am hating dumb woman because i am being rejected by girls that i hit on and should just go for the ugly ones instead of hot girls,2,NOT
her voice is hard to listen to for very long,2,NOT
so more women should enter science and tech cool why arent they and why do they expect the business fields to change working hours for womens needs instead of planning ahead for children and choosing your field accordingly,2,NOT
it isnt just the hours women retire earlier which is the time in your career you typically make the most money men typically are more willing to take dangerous jobs over safe ones which is why we see more men as ice road truckers and more women as nannies men typically are willing to take more risks move accross country for a better job pish harder to negotiate their salaries etc there is so much that goes into this looking at this statistic is just plain misleading,2,NOT
in the top  paying degrees  of them are men dominated in the top  least paying degrees  of them are women dominated,1,NOT
we had feminism to give women choice we have feminism again because most women didnt choose to go into stem jobs,2,NOT
has no one thought that the wage gap could be because women dont try as hard at their respective jobs as men do,3,NOT
i think this really doesnt express the problem,1,NOT
get rid of the fair pay act,2,NOT
so the earnings gap is due to womens choices is what youre saying women more often choose not to go for jobs if they have to work less flexible hours whereas men more often choose to go for those jobs fair and square no problem there,2,NOT
i know what we miss is that its not real their just saved everyones time,2,NOT
the only way the wage gap is going to be fixed is if men stop being stereotyped to be the provider and start being shown as a care giver like being nurses or teachers more often oh and of course take care of their dam children,2,NOT
i work with a pretty heavy amount of women and they all make as much if not more than i do they also tend to do things like smoke breaks more often constantly using their phones constantly needing to leave midwork to go deal with their children,2,NOT
wait this was actually logical,1,NOT
very hard for men to give birth until that changes this non issue will always be like this,2,NOT
women making that kind of money is disgusting thats way too much for them to be earning,5,ABU
wow vox made a video i actually think is well put together and i agree with,1,NOT
the wage gap is a difference in hours worked on same jobs if a man works  jours while a women works the standard  then the man is paid more,2,NOT
tired of this bullshit am unsubscribing,2,NOT
youtube is suggesting that the next video i watch is called there is no gender wage gap from prageru which implies that this is the type of video watched by many who watched this one thats interesting because this video provides a nuanced understanding of the gap based on research while im fairly certain prageru based on many of their other vidoes does not of course if there was no gap there would be at least some industries in which men are underpaid which do not currently exist hats off to vox for making the argument of those crazies in a noncrazy rational manner,2,NOT
aid agent too advanced,1,NOT
its unconstitutional to require businesses to hire certain people and to pay them a mandated amount,2,NOT
wow this was done by vox i cant believe they didnt ride the same there is a wage gap its because of oppression line that has been projected for decades,1,NOT
equal pay act of  people want something to complain about so they dismiss variables and this is where this wage gap came from if you are a woman getting paid less than a man for the same work in the same job take it to court instead of complaining online,2,NOT
quite sure women of my generation outearn men of my generation  the  graduation rate probably explains it,1,NOT
good thing you had a female presenter otherwise it wouldve been mansplaining,2,NOT
so what youre saying is that women earn less because they have children which then restricts the hours they can work and reduces their relative levels of experience when compared with people who have worked full time for the most part the other gaps are likely due to the fact that men and women are different with men having more physical strength more body mass higher muscle body composition ratio being taller more likely to take risks slightly higher iqs family roles encouraging males to work harder to support the family while the woman is caring for the baby ect until you invent a way for children to be made without the need for a mother and for as long as youre not pumping little girls with relatively huge amounts of testosterone hgh and retraining them to not be risk adverse or perhaps giving little boys drugs to make them more compliant and drugs to stunt their growth reduce their testosterone drastically there will always be a wage gap,3,NOT
if women that are not care givers and single without kids are making less than a man then we have a problem i dont see why its such a big deal that a women or a man can choose to be the one that stays and takes care of kids during early child development kids are important and there should not be shame to those that choose to take care of the children women or men,1,NOT
to fix this gap you dont make jobs more flexible timewise thats just stupid what you do is make sure that domestic duties especially involving children are split equally between husband and wife this way women can have kids and still have a career in a job that demands a lot of time also women are treated unfairly in the workplace theyre seen as less effective and evaluated under harder criteria than a man is in order to get promoted to fix this gap we need to make sure women are respected and seen just as capable as a man is and also make sure that domestic work is something everyone should do and is not considered unmanly because a lot of these things are not outright discrimination and mostly on the subconscious level we do not realize it is a problem but it is and it has shown the consequences,1,NOT
the wage gap is what we call a myth,2,NOT
i was worried that there would be an obvious political slant but im happy to say this is quite fair in its analysis of one part of the pay gap,1,NOT
lmao its funny how   people still think they should get paid more for no reason,2,NOT
i am outraged according to the numbers women garbage truck drivers make zero dollars wtf oh wait thats cuz there are zero women garbage truck drivers sorry my bad,2,NOT
there is no wage gap women statistically work less than men to care for children or take more vacations because woman also will take more time off than a man will,2,NOT
id rather like to see bell curves of incomedistribution rather than merely talking about averages the issue eludes me at large the grand overall gap between the genders is irrelevant as except for this video the grand biological impact of children is almost always glossed over and the mother who doesnt want to focus on her little bundle of cries and diapers is nothing but a bad parent those times are what social security systemspolicies are for the only real relevant part is are you getting the same per hour for the same quality of work and the opposite is illegal in most civilised countries anyway if your quality lacks and therefore you get less than your peers and thats not enough for you look for a job that better suits your skillset a world where everyone is required to work shouldnt exist that is just a tyrannical exploitative hell im completely fine when one partner whoever it is is able to sustain their family alone freeing the other to focus on the family,2,NOT
i disregard the whole video when your first statement is an obvious lie,2,NOT
if the gender wage gap had any reasonable meaning companies would increasingly and almost only hire women to lower their wage costs nobody does that therefore closing the gender wage gap is a target entirely based on ideology in particular the premise that men and women are equal in the sense that they should achieve the same income on average this is equal in saying that a construction worker should earn on avg the same income as a stock analyst because they are both humans and therefore equally capable of earning the same the gender wage gap was and still is ideological bullshit,2,NOT
i does not exist,2,NOT
fake women get treated the same,2,NOT
stop having kids with shitty men then they can share the bearing of the kids equally and neither have to sacrifice their jobs,2,NOT
you live in a free country woman are allowed to earn less if they want they are allowed to earn more if they want if they want to be a ceo and have kids unless the man takes care of them it wont work u cant have it all and thats okay,2,NOT
for thous who say there is no wage gap watch the video before making a comment please,1,NOT
good video but youre using wage gap and earnings gap interchangeably when the reality is different,1,NOT
