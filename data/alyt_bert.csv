"PLEASE do not just eat a ridiculous amount go calories a day, even if it is from vegan food. Eat enough and don't starve yourself. You don't have to be scared of carbs, but don't eat 40 bananas like Freelee because that's insane. Do not believe any of that pseudoscience bullshit!!",1,0

"Check out hotforfood if you want some less ""healthy"" vegan recipes. Gardein ""chicken"" tenders are amazing, honestly I don't even notice that they're vegan, not the healthiest thing ever but y'know, gotta have those cheat meals sometimes. As for everyday things, I personally always keep rice, beans, and frozen veggies around for quick and easy meals. Make sure you aren't letting yourself getting super hungry, that's when you'll end up craving and binging on foods that aren't as good for you. Congrats, Trish! Hopefully this will be the start to some great changes for your health.",1,0
"Next to delicious fruits, you can eat: lots of vegetables (cucumber, salad, tomato, bell peppers, courgette, zuchini, spinach, carrots,...), peanut butter yum!, a lot of nuts: pine nuts, pumpkin seeds, wallnuts,..., lots of seeds: chia, flax, hemp,... Next to that you also have to eat lots of carbs like potatoes, rice, quinoa,... There are a lot of foods and variety that you can eat!! :-)",1,0

"TRISHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Your fucking influence could change so many lives. 1 - Eat the melon alone. For reasons I don't remember, it's better to eat melon by itself. 2 - Vegan restaurants in LA are CaaaaaaRRRazzzy as I am sure you know. Don't restrict yourself. 3 - Look up vegan recipes on Pinterest. Cookie&Kate is my fave blog. OMG I'm so excited to hear this. I really hope it goes well. I hope Freelee gives you lots of advice.",1,0

"Freelee's ""you can eat as much as u want"" isnt 100% accurate...maybe it is if you run a 10k everyday, amd do alot of excersise, but the foods u can really ""eat as much as u want"" of are like carrot sticks (minus hummus) or like apples or oranges, or grapes because those will fill u up fast, bc they have a lot of water, so u wont really have to eat that much to be full. Like the whole eating a ton of rice, or a whole box of pasta, or 10 pounds of potatos or 10 mangos is not really healthy, unless off course, u do a ton of high intensity excersise...",1,0
"Regarding your weight, you may notice some fluctuations in your weight because your metabolism will be changing. 2 weeks is a relatively short amount of time so I would encourage you to keep being vegan even after your music video to see how it affects your body. Also, regarding food, eat as many fruits and veggies as you want and if you are feeling, hungry make sure to eat more potatoes and beans. Nuts are also a very good source of protein if you're worried about being protein deficient. The worst thing you can do on a vegan lifestyle is starve yourself, so just make sure that you are always full from healthy food. Good luck!",1,0
"Awesome! Quinoa is good for you and has protein. Add chia seeds to EVERYTHING! They fill you up, have protein, fiber, omega 3's, anitoxidants. I add them to oatmeal for breakfast, add fruit and cinnamon. Chia seeds are hydroponic, so if you were to add them to a smoothie, drink, or nut milk - they expand, so they fill you up. I am excited for you, great job!",1,0

"my favorite vegan recipe to make is veggie burritos- they're literally one of my favorite foods. you just saute√© onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms, roast some sweet potato (you can use regular potatoes but i like the extra sweetness) and corn, and cook up some rice. I like the make a huge batch of all of that and eat it throughout the week- you just pile all that onto a tortilla with some salsa and avocado and it's BOMB. kbye thanks eheheh",1,0

"Good for you girl!! Ignore all the 'vegan police' out there. The fact that you're even putting this out here as a decision is amazing! You can eat all the food you want...fruits, veggies, potatoes, rice, grains, beans, etc. don't calorie restrict yourself just eat until you're satisfied. And don't forget to treat yourself wth 'vegan 'junk food' sometimes! Love all your videos....I've been watching you for years and your videos always make my day!

Eat a lot of grains and potatoes with your vegetables and fruits <3 Good Luck!,1,0
"Hi trish! I haven't been vegan long, its been about half a year, but so far what has helped me is eating at least one really great starchy or carb filled meal a day like pasta, vegan pizza, or potatoes, something like that, it makes you feel so great and energized and won't send you into like a funk. Eat a variety! Beans, different colors of veg and fruit so you get all the nutrients you need, and that's how you actually feel great. Don't feel pressured to need to fit a vegan structure like raw or hclf in the beginning, it is easiest to just start by eating vegan foods that you like just so you don't feel as restricted in the beginning, especially for these 2 weeks. LA is so great for vegan foods, I live in China and it is way harder here :P Good luck!",1,0

"You can do this Trish! So happy for you and I love the ""I don't even know what's happening to me!"" We all know that feeling lol xo",1,0
Trish I will just say you won't see a difference in just two weeks. Your body will go through so much just by cutting out the types of food you like to eat. You can do it but I'd suggest longer than two weeks. I'll be honest it may do the opposite for you. I know I gained until my body was able to regulate. Just remember that. Also lots of water!!!!,1,0
"Try making noodle stir fry's, rice, pasta with tomato-based sauces and other carby things because to maintain a fully raw (all fruit and veggie) diet, you have to eat sooo much. To start off, you should try eating meals like the above to transition so it doesn't feel like a shock. If you go cold-turkey raw, I guarantee you won't stay vegan :)",1,0
Damn Trisha. Can you please slow down when you talk. I have to play back every time. Are you conscious when you do that?,1,0
Yess Trish yeess,1,0
Get some carbs in you potatoes are easy option!!! Seriously good for you trish,1,0

"potatoes: mashed, fries in the oven, stuffed, etc. rice, beans, fruits, GREENS!!!!!! Greens are a must: spinach, brocoli, letuce, green beens. You can make green smoothies: strwaberry with bananas (frosen) and lots of spinach with a dash of almond milk, or soy milk, rice milk(of your choice) and a dash of whater. If you want a burger, you can try the brand: Boca vegan burgers. They are delicious. if you miss cheese you can try the brand:go veggie cheese its vegan. or rhe falafel balls (there like meat balls but vegan). you can use Smart Balance that is dairy free butter. You can make spring rolls with veggies, potatoes and some soy meat with a sauce. Allways fruits and veggies more than the rest. There is a loooot of vegan foods, just go to whole foods, costco, walmart and youll find a looot, and go to vegan restaurants try it.",1,0

"Hi Trish! I am vegan and I love tofu cooked in coconut oil, stir fried veggies with pineapple and teriyaki sauce, oatmeal, peanut butter and bananas, those high protein vegan cookies your mom gives you, sandwiches (check out ""Just Mayo"" it is a vegan mayonnaise and it's so good). Also lots of fruits, lots of veggies, plain potato chips, chips and salsa, chips and guac, vegan curry and try out ben & jerry's chunky monkey that is vegan, its soooooo good!! :) Lots of rice, potatoes, berries, fajitas, vega protein powder and smoothies.... MMMMM and some Cliff bars! Try the Silk creamer for your tea/coffee, it's so good. :) GOOD LUCK TRISH!!!! YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL AWESOME.

"YES GIRL! okay so go get some almond milk or cashew milk it's amazing, especially if your a coffee person! DO NOT eat as many calories as possible...if your trying to loose weight. I would try to eat and much raw fruits and veggies as possible! Breakfast food that's amazing is fruit of course, nature path cereal or any vegan healthy cereal with almond milk any type of vegan milk..OATMEAL with frozen fruit it's soo good. lunch and dinner ideas are veggies big salads quinoa salads, brown rice , patatoes!(sweet patato and Japanese patatoes are amazing ) I would suggest drinking ALOT of WATER and adding lemon is always amazing. Eat as much FRUIT and VEGGIES as you want. Stay away from PROSSCESSED bleached foods like white pasta and white bread. Try grains like quinoa, brown rice, couscous. Limit your FAT intake, don't put oil on everything, don't fry stuff. add goof fats into you diet like avacado and coconut or nuts but don't over due them! Dont overload on SALT but if you need salt try sea salt or pink Himalayan sea salt.",1,0

"trish i'm so proud that you're going vegan, as a vegan myself, (well i'm still transitioning) i would recommend eating alot because fruit and veggies have less calories than meat and dairy products, if you don't eat enough you're gonna get sick. + take b12 supplement, it's in meat and not in veggies and fruit, but you really really need it. (i would also recommend binge watching what i eat in a day vegan vids on yt) xx",1,0

"You know what, Trisha? This is the BEST thing I've heard this day. :) My tips for you: 1. Mainly eat fruits & vegetables, and aside of that additionally eat carb stuff like rice, bread, pasta, potatoes, etc. 2. Eat enough ! A human needs 2500 - 3000 calories/day. If you feel tired or develop cravings, it's because you eat not enough calories/day or not enough carbs. 3. Drink a lot of water. Best thing: When you wake up, start the day with drinking water, because you got dehydrated in the course of the night.",1,0
why are you going directly vegan? you should try being vegeterian and then slowly move into being vegan. you cant go from binge eating fast food to becoming vegan,1,0
"Yay! I mean you're not vegan if you don't plan to continue this lifestyle, but I'm happy to see you eating plant based!! Pasta, rice, beans, etc! The best sauce I've made is tomatoes, lemon, red bell pepper, one white onion, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes! SO GOOD! And all raw!!!",1,0

But we all know this will never last and once you make a video of you eating meat or whatever your gonna get all this hate. You do this stuff to yourself. I think if you wanna do something positive, just keep it to yourself, so when you fail you wont receive hate from the internet. Just trying to help. Big hugs ....",1,0

There are plenty awesome kickass smaller vegan source youtubers out there! GOGOGO! My fav for simple easy yummy recipees/ideas of what to eat: High Carb Hannah, The Vegan Solution, Simply Quinoa, Cooking with plants. Remember you can basicly eat everything you used to, just veganise it. I eat homemade veggi burgers weekly, they are so awesome. Weight wise, the less processed you eat the better though. Most vegans disagree with you being able to eat unlimited, don't starve yourself by any means, but don't overeat or stuff yourself either. Best of luck :)",1,0

I would recommend you checking out mommytang and high carb Hannah's videos as well because mommytang eats lots of greens and Hannah eats tons of starches and they eat very simple. I know you don't like lettuce so you could try putting a bunch of greens in a smoothie along with some bananas maybe to drown out the taste of the greens. Having 1 or 2 fruit monomeals is great too! Just don't starve yourself! Good luck:)",1,0

"You can still get stuff at Starbucks they offer dairy alternatives. Also you need protein since you won't be getting it from meat and cheese; beans, legumes, nuts. If you make up some rice and beans and then toss it in a frying pan with some onion, carrots, a little garlic and soy sauce is my favourite way to eat beans. You also need green vegetables, there are all kinds of goodness in green vegetables that we all need. Kale and spinach are my favourites, and an easy quick thing to do is have smoothies for breakfast or lunch. I will take some water or some good juice and blend some spinach banana and frozen fruits and it's great on the go for a quick pick me up meal accompanied by a snack, lately I have been pairing it with watermelon.",1,0

"Holy shit haha I'm so happy to finally hear this!! Haha okay, so you are definitely off to a good start with the fruits and veg! I would recommend looking up ""Raw Vegan Not Gross"" for meal ideas. Some of her recipes are raw, some aren't, but they are all vegan. Definetly try eating more whole foods like beans, rice, lentils, fruits and veggies. The cleaner, the better. Smoothies are great for breakfast. There are loads of good green smoothies, and some super tasty fruit smoothies. There's loads of amazing junky food too, like cashew milk ice cream, mock meats, cheesecake, pizza, etc. but try to keep those to a minimum if you're worried about weight and skin. I'm a vegan who eats junk food all the time haha so my skin still breaks out. Maybe look into Lush's Dark Angel facial cleanser and tea tree toner to help with that. I've heard a lot of good things about that stuff. Anyway, good luck with veganism and holy shit, I really hope it sticks!!",1,0

"When I went vegan I ate the same kinds of food just vegan junk food (when i began, it's all a journey) and i lost 14lbs in 6 weeks and I was still eating loads. I educated myself and learnt more and my food has got so much better. I went from 15 stone (210lbs btw I'm 5ft6) I'm now down to 10 stone 4lbs. I don't diet I just eat when I'm hungry and my weight has stabilised and maybe I go down a little bit very slowly.

"It's actually really common for people to gain weight when they first go vegan/vegetarian, because their body is used to being deprived of nutrients from calorie deficiency (dieting/ starving yourself), and is still storing everything as a fat reserve. Your body will adjust within a month or so of normal eating (sufficient calories, carbs and nutrients) and plateau at a certain weight, then you'll start losing it. Best way to combat the initial weight gain is to drink a lot of water and exercise daily (45 min of cardio is a good starting goal). Just mentally prepare that you'll gain a bit of weight before you'll begin losing it because of your dieting habits :] Good luck! Oh and also, Root Chips + Leaf Cuisine spreads = bomb! It's healthy, probiotic chips and dip, and it can be used instead of creamcheese :] It's vegan and dairy free! If you want to substitute soda, try kombucha as well :]",1,0

YESSS!!! im so happy for u trish!!! be sure to have lots of grains also don't be discouraged in the beginning if you gain little bit of weight because your body is getting used to the metabolism from the vegan diet but eventually you'll start dropping the pounds a lot when I went vegan I am lost 10 pounds within the first two weeks so but I was vegetarian first so it was a little healthier than a carniat so just be aware that you might gain a little bit at first but then you'll start shedding off the weight nonstop!! good luck!!!,1,0

Do not be afraid of having bread or cereal or whatever you need to at least help you in the transition stage.whatever will make it easy and enjoyable for you.

"I don't think you'll see the results you want from going vegan in just 2 weeks. I've been on the diet for about 3 months and I've lost 36 pounds, my skin looks clearer, no more zits, I feel a lot healthier in general. It took a long time though to get into a good rhythm with food. I did so much research and watched so many food diaries on youtube. I think it's a good step, but you're not going to reap the benefits you want off of this diet in just 2 weeks, you might not even lose weight. Freelee looks great but she also exercises a lot, she's very active. I do think as a vegan you need to find a balance. Your body needs fats and oils which freelee is against. I use coconut oil to cook with and extra virgin olive oil, I also eat avocados and almonds to get my fats in. I still eat between 1200 calories a day to 1600 depending on my daily activity and because I'm dieting a little, I don't think everyone can just eat as many calories as they like from fruit and veggies and lose weight doing it, everyone's lifestyle is different. Get your veggies in for sure. My food diary usually consists of eating almonds with all natural organic peanut butter, I'll have a smoothie with 2 bananas, frozen berries, hemp protein, almond milk, sometimes a date or 2 then other days I'll switch my bananas for an avocado with spinach and berries and coconut water. For lunch and dinner I usually eat similar things. It could be a veggie burger, pasta with veggies, quinoa or brown rice with veggies. I like spicy foods so if you're like me you'll enjoy this snack. I buy peppers and red pepper hummus and just dip peppers into that and omg it's so good! If I'm craving chocolate I usually buy some organic dark chocolate, put it in the freezer and snap off a piece now and then. Always make sure you read the back of the label with everything you buy! There's lots of information out there, immerse yourself in research and you'll do great. Also if you're craving meat I'd buy meat from Morning Star or Gardien. For cheese always go with Chao cheese, it's the only cheese brand so far that's impressed me. Don't expect the fake meats and cheese to be identical to the real stuff, it's different, just still tasty in it's individual way.",1,0

"Gardein products are great, especially as you transition and might struggle to come up with meal ideas! You can NOT eat as many calories as you want. I've found that to be very misleading in this community. Use an online calorie calculator to get a general idea of what you should be eating, or better yet, get your RMR tested and know for sure how many calories your body burns at rest. Still pay attention to your macros at each meal (nothing crazy, just try to include a healthy protein at each meal). <<This is what has worked for me. You'll get 1,000 different answers, but you'll have to tweak it to find what works best for you. ;-)",1,0

"Yay!! Congratulations Trisha!! The next 2 weeks even if it is just that will save the lives of many animals :) Losing weight as a vegan (in my experience, the Freelee-worshippers WILL differ) is mostly veggies and fruits. A smoothie for breakfast, a brown rice wrap with tomato, lettuce, avocado, spinach, arugula, a smear of hummus or vegan cream cheese (kite hill ONLY good brand) for lunch, and a small pasta (Kite Hill even has ricotta cheese ravioli if you get a cheesy craving) for dinner. We have as much junk food and fattening food as any other diet. If you eat just Oreos and vegan ice cream, potato chips (nudge, most BBQ, salt and vinegar, and original flavored are vegan) you won't lose weight. Dieting as a vegan is still dieting. You just get to feel more full because vegan foods tend to be less calorie dense and more filling. You should expect to feel weird, kind of sick, then kind of good. Digestive changes WILL make you feel weird, it's natural. Good luck girl!",1,0

"Daiya's Mozzarella cheese is AMAZING! It's so delicious, I put it on everything, lol. Silk yogurt is SO good! Chocolate Almond Milk is delicious as well. Gardien makes a bunch of amazing Vegan meals, they'd be in the frozen section. Try not to take stuff out of your diet, but replace them with Vegan alternatives. For example, don't just cut out milk, replace it with Almond Milk, Cashew Milk, Soy Milk, Hemp Milk, Rice Milk, Banana Milk, etc. Say you eat Pizza every weekend or something, replace it with Vegan Pizza. If you don't want to make a Vegan Pizza, I know Daiya has a really awesome Vegan Pizza. Or if you like S'mores, you can still have S'mores, just use Vegan marshmallows and Vegan chocolate (Not all dark chocolate is Vegan) Or if you eat tacos every Tuesday, just replace the meat with tofu or Beyond Beef frozen ""meat"". I've been Vegan for 4 months and I've lost SO much weight! I literally eat whatever I want and how much I want. I'm never hungry!

"***READ FOR ALL THE ANSWERS YOU NEED!*** And to add, ""Eat whatever and how much you want"" is sort of a lie (to me). try to keep your calories still around the recommended 2000 area, and eat foods that are easy to digest for you. Drink lots of water, no soda or anything like that, KEEP THE SODIUM LOW! That will help prevent bloating the most, and try to keep around below 1000 MG a day. 500 MG at most is best, because our bodies aren't used to digesting sodium, so it clings onto water cells, which makes you appear bigger because then that water can't exit your system due to the bloating. You can also eat starches like rice, potatoes (not French fries! baked potatoes or even sweet potatoes are the bomb!) and also oatmeal, pasta (whole grain!) but NO BREAD. Bread has a lot of sodium and it is so hard to digest! pasta has nearly no sodium, and oatmeal has barely 200 per serving. I would also suggest to have melons and fruit as a lunch, like a fruit salad and banana smoothie for lunch after a oatmeal breakfast (make it with water though! and 0 calorie sweeteners aren't as bad as people think, as long as its saccharin and not aspartame) with lots of fruit on top! ( I LOVE pineapple, strawberry and blueberry!) and last but not least, you do need to do the tiniest bit of exercise. Maybe walking around town or around a mall for about an hour a day will help loads! Okay I'm done ranting XD remember, LOW FAT ( less than 20 g a day is when I feel best) high carb ( around 300-500 is what I usually get in a day) and around 1500-2000 calories (which is what I et around) and LOW SODIUM! (I usually have around 500-1000 MG a day) and about an hour of walking, and you'll do GREAT!!!! I really hope you've read this, and if you have, please give me feedback by replying if this has helped! remember, I went from 166 pounds to my lowest of 105, so I know what I'm saying ;)",1,0
but on your snapchat you just posted you eating sour cream and onion chips... which contains milk... so i don't know when you are actually doing this but just an fyi sour cream and onion chips contain milk...,2,0
"Trish, this is so great!!! I myself come from a very eating-disordered past... for years I alternated between extreme starvation and hardcore binge eating... which eventually just turned to binge eating all the time. Food became the central part of my life. My entire life was planned around food. And once I would binge, it would be like ""oh, well, I guess that was the whole point of today. Anything else I do today is pointless, may as well just go to bed."" This all changed when I went vegan. Here are my tips: 1. Eat as many whole foods as you can. If a fruit smoothie isn't satisfying enough for you in the morning, add lots of hemp seeds and almond/cashew butter and chia seeds. Those will give you healthy fats and fiber, increase your calorie intake, and just make you feel fuller and give you a better start to your day. Another important ingredient for smoothies for increased energy and nutrition: MACA POWDER. IT MAKES YOUR SMOOTHIE TASTE LIKE FUCKING MALT BALLS! Mmmm. 2. Stock up on ""emergency"" foods that are high in calories and easy to make (or don't require any preparation at all). Like frozen burgers, burritos, pizzas, but also just nuts and seeds. These will be your best friend when you don't have time and you NEED to eat something. It's good to snack on nuts or dried fruit throughout the day to keep yourself from getting hungry later in the day and then bingeing on something terrible. 3. Try to throw as many greens into your food as possible. You will eventually grow to crave them. And this is coming from someone who was obsessed with bacon and cheese and was disgusted with vegetables, lol. I now crave spinach, arugula, and kale. We humans are creatures of habit. You can literally train yourself to crave healthy foods. (Even if you can't stop eating the bad ones, lol.) It's best to sneak greens into a fruit smoothie, especially one with really sweet fruits like mango or pineapple, because then you can't even taste them. 4. Just Google things like ""easy vegan recipes"" or ""vegan comfort food"" and bookmark a bunch of them for future reference. Get Earth Balance vegan mac & cheese! But when you prepare it (with a plant milk of your choice + Earth Balance vegan butter - although it's fine without the butter honestly), add like 2 Tablespoons of nutritional yeast (you can get it at Whole Foods) for an extra cheesy flavor! Also, look up recipes for tempeh bacon - you can make bacon mac & cheese with that shit. Soooo good. There are so many great products out there. Obviously, the best, healthiest way to eat vegan (especially for weight loss) is to stick to eating as many whole foods as you can, make everything from scratch, etc (for instance, if you have a good blender, you can make your own mac & cheese from soaked raw unsalted cashews and sweet potatoes and nutritional yeast and lots of spices, or alfredo from soaked cashews and cauliflower and nutritional yeast)... but there are so many great products to buy and keep in your freezer. It's good to have them on hand for when you have no time and you're craving something savory and ""meaty."" If you don't have those products as a back-up, you might end up bingeing on something non-vegan and then feeling shitty about yourself. (Although with all the vegan options at Taco Bell, Chipotle, various pizza places, Wendy's etc, you can still get tasty vegan fast food!) Try Beyond Meat and Field Roast meat alternatives, they're SO fucking good. There are amazing nuggets at Whole Foods in the frozen food section, I think they're by that Whole Foods brand, 365 or whatever it's called. Take it from me, a person who used to binge like crazy and was only happy when I could eat tons of bacon and cheese and pasta with cream sauce and burgers and steaks. I couldn't IMAGINE going vegan until I watched a few documentaries (and Freelee's videos too) and decided to just fucking go for it. It saved my life, and now, I don't even eat that healthy all the time (I like meat alternatives, I like frying stuff in oil etc), but I'm still thin and looking good (and I don't exercise). Even when I smoke pot and binge (which happens often lol), my weight stays the same because it's all plant foods rich in fiber! Good luck!!! You can do it!!! <3",1,0

"I'm glad to see this but at the same time, you're not going vegan. You're going plant based. Going vegan implies that seeing and knowing what goes on in factory farms and fur farms has effected your morals entirely and that you have decided to stop supporting the evil. Veganism is not a diet it's a change of perspective , it's not supporting animal torture for the sake of taste and luxury. I hope your plant based diet does make you go vegan though. We need more people with a conscience :)",1,0

"I believe in you Trish!!! The biggest tips I have are to really look at labels and to just find things you like to eat and find vegan alternatives to the non vegan foods you like! Almost everything not vegan pretty much has a vegan alternative! You live in such a good place for it too, LA has so many vegan restaurants and shops! I'm so excited for you!!!!",1,0

"So, since you're going vegan mainly for health reasons (which is awesome anyways, I hope it works out great ) here are some more 'healthy options for food, but if you want anything more indulgent check out the chancel 'hot for food', it has epic recipes. Protein : beans, soy products ( tofu, tempeh - they are best if marinated or quickly in done in a tofu scramble ) quinoa, seating (more complex meat substitute, its basically gluten and more difficult, in my opinion, to prepare ). Don't be afraid of protein powders if that's your thing, try out soy, pea or hemp protein. Another channel with great meals is 'the vegan corner' which provides more healthy recipes . Breakfast ideas : smoothie bowls, oatmeal, tofu scramble, breakfast burritos, vegan yoghurt with fruit (though i don't know any good american brands), banana ice-cream, pancakes Lunch & dinner : salads, pasta, sushi bowls, baked potato with some toppings, soup, sandwiches (chow cheese is the best from what I've heard), veggies and tofu stir fry, veggie lasagne Good luck :)",1,0

"its all about baby steps and im so proud of you for doing something to better yourself and you have to take small steps to stay vegan and not get off track But yes, you definitely need more foods, more greens, more beans and grains, etc. Another thing, you should push your viewers to watch those slaughterhouse videos because it does really show you exactly what happens and makes everyone who sees them understand how horrible the reality of the situation is and it could make everyone change their views just like it did for you. Again, i am so proud of you trish for doing this",1,0

I wouldn't want you to eat too much calories, end up not loosing weight or even gaining it, and then end up blaming it on veganism and saying veganism didn't work out for you. Freelee, That Vegan Couple and most high carbers work out, they have very active lifestyles, so they can afford to eat that many calories! Truth is that you can and probably will lose weight coming from a standard american diet to veganism, but ""unlimited calories"" is an unrealistic expectation.

"Hey Trish! I'm also a new vegan but I have some experience as I've been a vegan for a few months now! I eat a starch based vegan diet rather than what Freelee eats (RAW TILL 4). Basically she eats an all fruit diet until 4 PM an then she cooks a vegan meal for dinner and she's made countless videos on what she eats in a day, definitely go check them out! Personally, however, what I find to be more sustainable is a starch based diet that a lot of vegans thrive on!! Here's an example of what I eat in a day: Breakfast: mango smoothie (I eat a smoothie for breakfast nearly every single day) I freeze bananas and mangos and put them in it for a cool and creamy texture similar to icecream! Lunch: three small brown potatoes with and asparagus, broccoli, and cauliflower medley! I typically put a tomatoey sauce on top or sometimes barbecue sauce if I'm looking for some nice tang Dinner: basmati rice and black beans with an avocado sprinkled with granulated garlic! I usually combine the mixture w tomatoes, red onions, and lime! In addition I have a bit of salsa on the side! Snacks: I ONLY eat fruit for snacks, remember to carb the fuck up! If I were you I would stock up on rice, legumes/beans, fruit!!!!! And vegetables, whole grain breads and pasta, and vegetable stock! Also try lots of lentils and stuff like quinoa, the recipes are endless!! ALSO cauliflower is amazing and is good for a lot of vegan dishes! I find the most of mine on Pinterest, it's amazing! Remember that you must eat in abundance on this diet and stray away from replacement items like daya cheese, HOWEVER, if you crave those items, spend the money on a vegan pizza every once in a while! You will make mistakes but just remember to forgive yourself! This is no temporary fix however, if you want to see true long term results you must continue on a beautiful diverse whole plant based diet! Since my vegan transition I have lost the excess off of my stomach and see it being a lot flatter, in addition, my skin isn't perfect bc I do suffer from acne, but it has become much more manageable and has cleared up tremendously! Throughout this journey, you will see body results but it also teaches you how to love your body, and also a lot about compassion! I encourage to keep researching the vegan lifestyle and motivate yourself to continue! Love you Trish, good luck on your vegan journey!",1,0

"Yay! ALLLLL THE TIPS! I've been vegan for 8 yrs. I know it all. LOL You might feel kinda crappy the first few days after adding hella fiber to your diet. And to be way honest, everybody I know that has gone vegan has had some intense gas the first few days. Just light a candle and go with it, once that old shit gets out of your system you'll feel better and be way less puffy. Drink as much water as you can, that helps a ton too and makes your skin even nicer. Just like there are a lot of ways to diet for meat and dairy diets (low carb, clean eating, weight watchers, etc) there are also a lot of ways to do it vegan. I've seen the most people loose weight (my self included) eating a high carb low fat whole foods diet. the hashtag HCLF will be an easy way to find ideas of what to eat. You can also gain weight by eating a lot of high fat, oily, and processed vegan foods. I know, I've done it. I tend to maintain pretty well doing a balance of the two, but heavy on the HCLF side. Get it girl! Stick with it and you are going to have so much energy and look fucking HOT for your shoot!",1,0

avocado is high in fat and a lot of vegans say to not eat too much of it (it's freaking delicious though) but I would just recommend eating beans (not sure if they are high in fat) and also just eating some really healthy veggies and fruits (everything has a little bit of protein in it),1,0
"You can get protein from many things like nuts, soy, and potatoes with skin. I have been vegan for a couple years now and pasta is really filling and avocado sticks to your ribs so you will feel full for longer. Make sure to buy vegan bread because some bread contains egg.

"Potatoes! Rice! Pasta! Make sure you stay full, Trish. You can eat lots but it needs to be healthy. Vegan foods can be just as processed as meats so be wary of anything that comes from a box (although they taste delicious and are amazing for when you're craving animal products). Be cautious of eating only water-dense fruits. Those are essentially that, water, and they won't help you feel energetic through the day.

"Even if you don't stay vegan after the 2 weeks, much respect for giving it a go :) As for diet advice, ideally you would track your calories so you don't under eat too much or over eat (usually people under eat on a vegan diet). Rice, pasta, potatoes, beans, lentils, chickpeas, vegetables, mock meats, mock cheeses ('violife' etc. not sure what's available for you), non dairy milk, I like almond milk myself. Fruit is also great. However, I disagree that you can eat as many calories as you like. Take a b12 supplement I take 'Veg1' which has vitamin D and others too. Good Luck!",1,0
I've been vegan since May 12th I love it! So proud of you girl this made my week!!!!!

A good thing to try if you don't want to give up milk is Almond milk. It honestly tastes better than regular milk and is way better for you and the animals. And spinach and kale salad with veggies mixed in is to die for. Once you go vegan you will have way more energy, better skin, and you will be happier because your helping out the animals. Love you, Trish.",1,0

"Just letting you know the grapes are full of sugar & baby carrots are normal carrots shaped to look like baby carrots. I don't advise you to go on FreeLees diet, I put on weight with her diet. I advise you to always have breakfast, maybe start juicing for lunch & protein with 3 veg for dinner. And try not to eat after 7.30pm if you get hungry after dinner try eating a couple of dates or date rolls with skim milk for desert or a treat. FreeLees eat large amounts doesn't work.",1,0
"Educate yourself, eat enough calories, and stock up on staples like rice, potatoes, beans, oats etc and if you accidentally eat something not vegan it's no big deal, you already did it just stop if you figured out its not vegan and continue on with life just continue to vegan.

"Yay Trisha!!! Finally!! I recommend Vega protein powder & use almond milk. I also love this app called Yummly, you can look up vegan recipes. I like morning star or Gardein for like little snacks through out the day or for dinner. I also recommend yoplait yogurts because they do offer you calcium and protein or you can eat mixed nuts or dried fruit because those will also offer you protein. Garbanzo beans, quinoa, and couscous are awesome sides to have for any meal because they are super high in protein. And for me I eat tofu quite often bc it's tasteless so you can use any sauce on it and it'll only taste like the sauce, but the texture is like scrambled eggs. It's super easy once you get the taste of all the awesome vegan foods you won't want to go back to eating meet üòä",1,0

"OMG Trish!! I hope you're still reading comments, you have to look up the starch based diet of dr. mcdougall please!! Rawtill4 won't work for fast weightloss (for most people) and can lead to weightgain, when someones really physically active and fit (vegan) then it's good to add more fruit to maintain weight but for fast weightloss definitely try the wholefood starch based diet with no oil, salt or high fat content foods (avocado,nuts,seeds..) it might also make a huge difference for skin (for me it did) but also if you have anxiety etc before shooting a music video then find a way to reliefe stress as that could also cause breakouts. There's tons of ways to eat vegan it takes a bit time to find the best diet for you, just doing alot of research about vegan diets will help (preferably the work of plant based doctors like john mcdougall, t.colin campbell, caldwell esselstyn, michael greger...) remember you don't just want to look healthy but to truly be healthy and minimize your risk for ALL top killer chronic diseases.",1,0

It's really a dilemma I think. It's about making sure the two trans girls are included socially etc. with other girls while doing their sport. But it's also about fair play! My best suggestion of solving the dilemma is making an ‚Äúopen female‚Äù group in which cis girls and trans girls can participate + a group only for cis girls. Maybe they could compete together but when the results and medals are announced the girls would be separated in a result for the cis girls group plus another result for the ‚Äúopen group‚Äù?,2,0

Also eating lots of seeds and nuts, are very good and yummy! I make my own trail mixes for lunch time. Quinoa is also awesome. Don't give up and try your best to continue with this!

U can add tofu too) but YES goodluck babe eat lots of veggies and fruit honestly it'll make u so energized,1,0
get the fruits as they are naturally.. not packaged... do you realize how expensive that will be even over the course of two weeks... I know you're making bank.. but it's the principle... If you're going to go for it.. do it in the best way possible. <3 good luck!!,1,0

"IT WON'T LAST IF YOU DON'T EAT ENOUGH. Listen; You have abused your body for years by going on these crash diets. That means you have something called metabolic damage. In the beginning, Freele gained weight as a vegan, because her body wasn't used to that much food. So yeah, you will gain weight in the beginning, BUT once your body has had time to heal, you'll lose fat (not weight, but fat) And that can take some time, maybe a year. So if you think vegansim is the solution to lose weight before your music video, you're wrong. I still hope you'll go vegan, bc vegansim is the long term solution to weightloss and you will never have to crash diet ever again. ‚ù§ I just hope you are not going to starve yourself in order to lose weight, go crazy bc of the lack of nutrients, and then blame vegansim, like The ""Balanced"" Blond did.",2,0

"For making going vegan a bit easier just check out recipes from hot for food, minimalist baker and Mary's test kitchen. Their recipes will give you a shit ton of inspiration and just so yummy. Also since you live in America it will be so easy for you because 1 their are a shit ton a restaurant and cafes that you can just eat at when u don't want to cook and 2 their are so many mock meats and yoghurt and mock stuff that taste great. If you ever crave anything you can just buy a great substitute or find in a vegan restaurant or just cook it. You have so many options, it should be pretty easy. Biggest tip you have to eat a bit more then usual because vegan food is less caloricly dense most of the time. You don't even have to change ur diet if you don't want to its just the art of substitution. if you had like a yoghurt for breakfast just eat a vegan one or a breakfast sandwich you can make a vegan one or most probably buy one.

"Your ""diet"" choice doesn't matter, vegan, vegetarian, etc, it is about input and output!!! what helps you lose weight is burning more calories than you consume! That's science.

Also if your breaking out its because of sugar so dairy with high carbs (any kind that is low fat) will break you out and its even worse if its dairy that is low fat mixed with sugar. Stay away from sugar and low fat dairy and especially the combination if you don't want to break out. I got rid of my acne like this.,1,0
Yayyyy Trisha! I used to be against vegans and hated that they used you in videos to make you go vegan. But 3 weeks ago I watched knives over forks and I went vegan just like that.

It is definitely a good thing you are going vegan I would suggest that you eat plenty of carbs and many different types of hole plant food beans pasta legumes fruits vegetables and there is vegan goodies as well. There are many different ways to go vegan. Also I would include cooked food. Just know it takes time and do your best and find what works for you and will keep you vegan for life. You can never eat too much. Have fun enjoy your journey.,1,0

"watch ""greatest speech you will ever hear"" it gave me the final push to go vegan",1,0
"Im vegan and ive got a couple of things to say about this (nothing negative i promise) First off i think what you said about if freelee would be nice in her youtube videos, if she would people wouldnt watch, when she does shocking things people do watch. There are sooooo many vegan youtubers out there that are nice but none of them are as popular as freelee. Second, what you do need to realise is that having a vegan diet wont magically make you lose weight, the only thing is that vegan things are generally less dense in calories, although they do fill you up, thats why when people go vegan they will lose some weight in the first few weeks, but then when your body starts craving those calories you will stop losing weight, unless you obviously go high carb low fat like freelee, because thats just a really good way to lose weight slowly and healthily. And third, i would recommend eating lots of fruit and not too much other food for now for these two weeks to lose weight quickly for the video, but if you want to stick with it you should definitely eat more rice, potatoes, beans, legumes, bread and meat replacers, since they are the things that will fill you up most, and they will have enough calories to keep you going, if you eat too little calories you will feel horrible and blame veganism, although really youre just not eating enough. And then last: My favorite thing about veganism, and i think yours too, is you get to eat so much more! Even with processed food vegan things tend to have less calories, so you get to eat more, without having more calories. I hope you'll make the right choice after these two weeks, the right choice for your own health, for the animals, and for the planet. If you want to educate yourself further i would recommend watching cowspiracy, and earthlings (although earthlings only shows animal abuse, as where cowspiracy shows more environmental issues).",1,0
eat lots of greens it will help with the digestion and where you can get your protein.,1,0

If you like how it feels, and you know you want to eventually be a vegan for life, know that it can happen, and that if you go back and eat some animal product, once, twice, a few times, you don't have to throw in the towel. Some people go vegan overnight and stick to it, but many, many people don't, like me: If you really feel how it feels in your heart as well as physically and mentally, you can get there. Never ever thought I'd go vegan either, in the past.",1,0

"FIRST OF ALL - You did NOT loose your SD card! That's a BOLD FACE LIE. I watch Freely and HER card became corrupt and they tried to save the footage and NO video stores could salvage it! SO she said to be fair you can't upload yours. You ate vegan Dog nuts and she showed you slaughter videos. She even has footage of you trying the doughnuts. On her VIDEO she tells your entire conversation about why your not gonna post yours. You get caught EVERYTIME you lie. SECOND- Everything you bought is Fruits = STRAIGHT SUGAR & You WILLLLLL GAIN A TON OF WEIGHT. You HAVE to eat a balanced diet or you WILL GET VERY SICK. You HAVE TO HAVE Nuts, Veggies, rice, beans, avacados, proteins, healthy fats, fiber, Carbs, you name it. Each of those things plays a part in bone density, blood pressure, kidney & liver function, MAJOR ORGAN function. YOU CAN DIE from NOT having a proper diet. THIRD-FREELY works out and rides a bike for 18+ MILES daily. They literally spend 12hrs a day on fitness, so she WILL BURN OFF the '40 Bananas a day' she promotes. Go watch all the other videos of girls who got deathly I'll on her diet, who gained 35lbs, Her man Durian uses steroids to build muscle who KNOWS what she does. She ate like 50 mangos on one sitting, it was like 35,000 callories!! NO ONE can eat that and be so tiny!! Ask ANY DR!?!?!?! I am all for you being Vegan but listen to a REAL Dietician.

There's nothing wrong with being raw, but there is definitely more variety as a vegan than a raw vegan. You're the best Trish ^-^ I hope you stick to the diet for a while, and I know you can do it!",1,0
That's awesome!!! You go girl!!! It's super easy!! But rather than doing it temporary why not do it for life? You should include beans and rice. Brown rice and any kind of beans!,1,0
"Hey trish! I eat a lot of rice with beans (for protein), and pasta. I also like to make wraps or burritos, french fries or onion rings (fried in vegetable oil, not too healthy but good lol). You should also try any kind of veggie burger, they can be hit or miss but most of the ones I've tried have been so good, just make sure you get it with no mayo or cheese and the bun is multigrain/whole wheat bc those are usually vegan as well. Good luck :)",1,0

For protein I make quinoa and brown rice on a weekly basis. Gardein has really yummy fake chicken. Not super healthy but a nice treat if you have a craving. The beauty of a vegan diet to me is that I eat until I'm satisfied but don't experience the pain and exhaustion of overeating food my body struggles to digest. Dairy is a hard one to give up especially cheese. To me the cheese replacements are a bit pungent I personally like saut√©ed mushrooms as an alternative. The most important thing is to remember that we are all doing the best we can and wherever this journey leads you we have to have respect for one another's choices.,1,0

"Ill tell you what i learned from being vegan for 2 years. Im eating meat now because my b12 was heading towards the danger zone. Dont let that deter you though, i just sucked at being vegan lol. As much as i took pride in making the food i was still a pretty lazy chef and was very uncreative when it came to eating out. But these were the good bits. :3 1. The best time to eat melon is either at the start of your day or when you havent eaten in a fair while as melons have a pretty high water content and will run into anything ingested before it. 2. When i was trying i beat a lot of unhealthy food cravings by studying the contents of each thing, identifying what part of the food it was that i was craving and then substituting the unhealthy thing for a healthy option (chocolate craving was magnesium, fast food craving was usually fat and would be replaced with an avocado, nuts or whatever). 3. I couldnt afford vegan cheese so veg pizza with whatev i could find to add flavour was a staple",1,0

"Welcome to the Vegan life! Here are some things that helped me when I transitioned from vegetarian to full vegan: 1) Water. Water, water, water. Your body is about to go on a journey, so be nice to yourself, and keep it clean. 2) Fruit for breakfast! It's the easiest meal plan ever, you can have as much as you'd like, and the fruit you consume in the morning pushes out what you ate the day before. 3) Be kind to yourself. This is a new lifestyle and you will make mistakes. That's OK! Just make a mental note about what you ate, don't buy it again, and move on. 4) If weight loss is your main inspiration for going vegan, check out the Skinny Bitch books! They have a sharp tone, but are also funny and informative. 5) When you can't take it any more and are seriously craving junk food, remember: Oreos are accidentally vegan. :)",1,0

Way to go I'm so proud of you !!!! Don't be too hard on yourself your not gonna be perfect in the beginning especially so if you fall off the wagon get right back on it and keep going. Don't starve yourself if your starving your gonna eat anything. Keep easy foods around the house ready to go so you always have something healthy. Get a rice maker and keep it going with rice in it all the time ( brown rice will keep you full longer but some people prefer white do whatever works for you ). Keep canned beans and frozen veggies around too for yourself and of course the fruit but your already rockin the fruit.,1,0

"Definitely eat more substantial foods, besides fruit to keep you full for longer and give you more protein and fiber. Like, Beans, lentils,whole grains(Quinoa, brown rice, oatmeal, sprouted whole grain bread) and also veggies!! You need veggies to be more satisfied because of the high vitamins and minerals found in them. Definitley gave your greens! If they are hard for you to eat throw them in a fruit smoothie! Spinach is great in smoothies because you can't taste it at all. Try to like saut√© or steam veggies, like broccoli, green beans, asparagus, honestly any veggies you like. Once you start eating the little by little your taste buds will adapt and you will eventually start really like vegetables. Also hummus is really good to dip veggies in :) I hope this helps and I hope to see you sustain this lifestyle and incorporate more fruits and veggies in your everyday life! love you trish",1,0

"I wont be a bullshit vegan guy right now. Not all things vegan are good but the best vegan meat brand is Gardein. There meat if the best. Excluding the meatballs. Also the best meat I've ever had is Morning star Riblets! You have to try them. Best sour cream is Tofutti brand. Finally the best cheeses have to be from Follow Your Heart. The best spreadable cheese to go with a cracked plate is Nuttin' Ordinary plain cashew spread. , it has a sharper taste like stronger dairy cheese does. So Delicious Cashew Salted Caramel ice cream with chocolate chips was one of the best ice creams I've ever had but you have to really like caramel to like it. Here are some tips to save money. Buy frozen fruit more often then fresh because they are much better in smoothies and they are cheeper. Another tip is to look at the ingredients in store brand breads because more often then not they are vegan because it's cheeper to make that way. (writing the rest plus some recipes down below)",1,0

"This video was filmed around June 21. Is she joking by proclaiming veganism or even vegetarianism? Yes, but i think it's based on ignorance. A lot of people who become vegetarian or stick with the vegan lifestyle are cutting out meat or animal byproducts because of vicious deaths of living animals. Cutting out meat and/or animal byproducts can also be very good for the human body if you're maintaining a healthy and balanced meal with other nutrients. But by becoming vegan/vegetarian it really begins with educating yourself on how to do so.",2,0

My husband recently went vegan about a month ago. I went more vegetarian. My first shopping trip I couldn't help but laugh at myself because of how much fake meat I bought. I definitely am not used to cutting out meat yet but I haven't had any real meet in a few weeks. I take pictures of all the products I buy and put it on my Instagram so I can track what things I actually like when I go shopping again. Gardein and Daiya are two of my favorite brands so far.,1,0
"Check out a youtube channel called The Vegan Corner, makes all kinds of vegan friendly dishes like lasagna, brownies, curry, tortillas, cinnabons, etc.You are definitely going to want to make at least one meal instead of eating just strictly fruits and vegetables all day. That's usually what I do, I snack all day on fruits and veggies and make a vegan friendly meal during the part of the day where I have the most time. Also, you're gonna hear a lot about ""smashing carbs and calories"" don't do that when you're starting out, eat as much as you'd like but don't overeat to the point where you're too full, that will just make you end up feeling kind of sick. I have binging problems, I just feel like sometimes I have a void that I need to fill, so veganism is great for me because I can literally just eat and eat and not gain any weight from it, those baby carrots are great for binging if you ever have an urge, same with celery, apples, anything that requires a good amount of chewing, don't be afraid to use some peanutbutter or humus with some of those things too. The great thing about being vegan is you can eat two or three times the amount of salad and it'll make up one little cheeseburger from mcdonalds. Speaking of burgers, try some veggie burgers, Trader Joe's has pretty good ones or you could look up recommendations online. Even when I was a meat eater, I still preferred them over an actual beef burger. And don't think that just because you're vegan means you can't eat junk food, you can still eat chips, oreos, fritos, nutter butters, poptarts, etc, just google if vegan friendly foods and you should get a huge list. Also, continue researching on veganism in your free time, you really do so much good to the world just by doing that one simple thing of choosing something different to eat for your dinner. It's kind of like recycling, you feel like it doesn't do much but when you join a group of people who's goal is the same, it has a bigger effect than you think. Hope veganism goes well for you!",1,0
"I seriously dislike freelee as a vegan, I prefer to watch the Unnatural Vegan instead and other YouTubers who use science and evidence to back up reasons for going vegan (beyond animal rights), and how to make sure you don't have a bad transition.

"@blndsundoll4mj Being vego will make you gain - i gained over 10kg when vego then went vegan and lost like 20kg... struggle to keep it on tbh.. Stay away from the dairy!! its pure fat! baby cow growth formula. Fruit, veg, carbs like potatoes, pasta, rice and like maybe a couple of awesome vegan donuts per week (or day) and you will lose weight.. your body may need more than 2 weeks to adjust though so PLEASE don't be discouraged if its not immediate! - its a lifestyle, not a diet - keep that in mind. If you're only doing it to look good its called ""plant based"".. Took me a couple month to fully adjust so please be patient and don't expect results a) in a couple weeks OR b) if you are still having chicken, eggs or any milk products OOORRR c) if you're not in it for the right reasons (bc it won't last and therefore it won't work). OH also, if you eat unripe bananas you'll be constipated. ALSO the food you showed is like literally one meal!! MORE POTATOES!! <3 Good luck Trish.. please listen to the advice and don't expect results if you don't do it right yeah?!",1,0

"I've been vegan for 2 years, and raw vegan for a month and I love it. Fruit and vegetables are great and entirely sustainable, but you'll crash if you don't eat enough of them. (I eat minimum of 2000 calories worth of them on raw) I find that raw vegan is the best way to maintain a slim figure, I did gain weight on a regular vegan diet. I LOVE raw vegan protein shakes, they come in tons of good flavors and are wonderful in smoothies. For regular vegan, veggie sushi is amazing. Basically anything Thai or Indian is super yummy too just make sure that it is vegan. You'll be surprised how many things are vegan when going out, personally I loved chipoltle's sofritas. Congratulations on trying this lifestyle.",1,0

Pasta with marinera sauce plain or with sauteed mushrooms or squash. Oatmeal with almond milk with bannans and berries inside. Fruit Smothies with almond milk. Avocado toast. Bocca burgers.

"Hey Trish!! Some of my fave vegan foods are: vegan brownies (you can either get the recipe on google or you can buy them in stores sometimes) bean curd/tofu - try the marinated tofu, or you can get awesome chinese meals with bean curd (often sweet chilli/sweet and sour sauce) try spicy bean burgers too- they're filling and imo taste better than some 'fake meat' options I also love vegan bacon but I've been veggie for a long time so it might take a while for you to adjust to! Overall, try meals filled with rice, cous cous or quinoa (they keep you full) and incorporate lots of flavours into your diet (like soy, chilli, etc). I'm definitely not an expert but I've been veggie my whole life so hopefully you might find one of these ideas interesting!

"Freelee can eat a ton of calories because she excersizes like crazy and she's superrrr fit. The key to the raw till 4 diet that she promotes is eating a ton of carbs in the form of fruit, veg, rice and potatoes, and excersizing hardcore for an hour a day and being active. If you want to loose weight on a vegan diet and not excursive that much, you need to lower your caloric intake because your body won't be burning all of those calories off. There's no doubt about it though that whole foods (especially when they're in their raw form) are the best for your body and you will be the healthiest off nutritionally. If you're just eating vegan, not specifically raw till 4 or excersizing frequently, I would suggest to eating so that the bulk of your diet comes from fruit and veggies (cooked or uncooked) with some brown rice / potatoes accompanying it and once in a while adding in some beans and rarely some nuts/seeds. You don't have to worry about protein deficiency because it literally doesn't exist since everything you eat has protein in it. Don't cook with any oil and try not to add salt to any food you're eating. That's to loose weight. If you're going to fall off the wagon and are thinking about stopping being vegan, it's good to educate yourself more on the ethical reasons why a vegan diet is so good. Watching Forks Over Knives, Gary Yourofksy's speech on youtube called ""The Best Speech You Will Ever Hear"", Earthlings, and other things will help. Also as well if you're feeling like you're going to fall off the wagon because you really want to eat your favourite _____ , try looking for a vegan version of that in the grocery store. Lots of times the vegan version of things are really tasty and helps the transition. Or have some pasta or bread (non-whole foods carb options). These things are not recommended for loosing weight though. That's more for the rare treat or once you've reached your goal weight. To loose weight, cut out the alcohol, up your water intake to about 3-4L a day (a big 1L or 2L water bottle really helps with this) and drink 1L of that water with lemon each morning BEFORE you eat breakfast (maybe drink it while you go for a walk first thing after you wake up and then come back to eat), and make sure you're getting adequate sleep and try to avoid stress. Hope this helps :)",1,0

not that you ever read my comments anyways however I will say I've tried the vegan thing just all fruit and you can still gain weight if you're not like freelee riding a damn bicycle 10 miles or more daily you're not working on anything you're eating so it doesn't matter what you're eating so being vegan or vegetarian for that matter does not matter as far as losing weight stopping the dairy not eating red meat will certainly help you but you still should count calories and watch your intake eat lots of protein. you can do this Trish do it for the animals I've always thought of being vegan also why I haven't started and or started and kept doing it I don't know one day I do love those people who are vegans one for what they stand for when it comes to the animals however there's a lot of drama going on in the vegan community and I won't say any names or anything else but I am sometimes scared of becoming a vegan because I'm afraid it will turn me into a real bitch LOL,2,0

Once I started taking freelees advise I developed binge eating disorder. No of course that is not completly freelees fault but her emphasis on ""smashing in the carbs"" led me to trying to eat as much as her then I eventually got used to it. I ended up gaining even more than I lost originally, my triglycerides in my blood test were too high and I was struggling with digestive issues and energy level issues. I am still struggling with binge eating to this day two years later but try as hard as I can to actually eat only when I'm hungry (not out of boredom) and stop when I feel good and satisfied rather than overstuffed and feeling like I'm gonna explode.",2,0

You can eat as many fruits and veggies as you want üçåüçëbut beware of vegan junk food. Try to not eat after 7 and hydrateüí¶. Some meat and dairy alternatives to eat in moderation that are amazing are: Chao Cheese, Gardein Chicken, and almost anything from Starbucks without whipped cream, Java chips and with soy or coconut milk as a substitute. I love you Trishy and I'm so psyched you're joining the vegan family. Keep up your fiber and protein, rice and beans for days, smash in the fruit girl! I hope you love your two week vegan experience and it becomes a longterm thing, it's not a diet it's a lifestyle but it also doesn't have to take over your life! üíïüíïüíïüíï",1,0

"You cant eat 5000 calories of plant based foods and expect to lose weight or not gain weight. Look up people who have gained weight when they switched to a high carb Vegan diet. Also you are not ""going vegan"" for 2 weeks if its for aesthetic reasons. The correct term is PLANT BASED. Good Luck",2,0
"make sure you're not just eating fruit and veg in a day! you need protein and carbs like pastas and rice (wholegrain if you want to be healthier), otherwise your body will cling on to the natural sugars in the fruit and you won't loose any weight. Nuts and lentils are also important. Also those vegan donuts/ original chips are good ideas for salt and sugar in limited amounts!

"Ahhh Trishy this is so exciting! Okay, my favorite go-to is beans & rice. Beans have a good amount of protein and the rice helps keep you full! Pasta is also really good and since you apparently like carrots based off this video, you could do some thinly sliced carrots in the pasta and it would be so good! And if you like avocados, they have some protein too. They also have some fats that are good for your body, and they can be spread on toast and have a relatively similar texture to butter. Protein shakes are another good option, and I frequently have those for breakfast. And if any of your bananas get really soft and overripe, peel them, cut them up, and put them in the freezer so you can blend them up to make banana ""ice cream"" as a sweet treat! Good luck with these 2 weeks and I'm sure they'll open your eyes to everything you can still eat as a vegan!

Okay so some snacks you could do are potatoes, literally potatoes are your best friend. My favorite is Japanese sweet potatoes because yes. Another thing is if you want to make something that requires eggs use flax seed eggs as a vegan alternative which you can get a target (: as far as milk I prefer sweetened almond milk over soy milk",1,0

"As far as frappuccinos go (I mean they're not healthy, but if you want one every once in a while) there are vegan options. The actual base of ALL fraps is dairy free (whether you're getting a coffee base or ""cream"" base) or you can swap out the regular base for soy milk if you want, you just have to focus on the flavour portion and skip anything with dairy (example: nothing chocolate) and no caramal drizzle, and obviously no whipped cream. If you get the ""light"" version of any frap, it automatically contains dairy. So frappuccinos you can still get: coffee, mocha, oprah chai, espresso, green tea, strawberries and cr√®me.",1,0

"Don't be scared of the calories. I know it's hard because society teaches us this calorie-restrictive way of thinking, and that's the only way to stay skinny. I can see that you're in that mindset now. I used to be in that mindset too. But remember that it's not true. It's not about how much calories you eat, but which calories you eat. My biggest tip for you: Always remember to get enough calories. I can't stress this enough. If you undereat you'll end up feeling tired and just go back to animal products. Plant foods are lower in calories so you'll have to eat more amounts to get enough calories. Also know that cravings is your body's way of telling you it needs fuel. So eat as much as you want and crave. You can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet AS LONG as its High carb-low fat! Good luck Trish. Xx",1,0

"here are my tips for you. (1)The most important tip is to eat until you get full, DO NOT try and eat as much as Freelee, you will feel sick. (2) keep it simple & don't try to follow in sort of guidelines. What I mean by this is do not eat a bunch of raw foods because it's not 4pm yet - if following raw till 4. Trust me you will end up over eating because you didn't have what you are craving. (3)Just about everything can be made vegan. If you get a craving have a little bit. For example, I crave pizza, chocolate, waffles etc., what I do is look up vegan recipes/ where to find those vegan teams and eat them. If I crave chocolate, I buy the bar and I eat a square or two and then tuck it away for a rainy day. (4) while any exercise is good exercise, I recommend you do a little more than normal. Ex: taking a morning walk/jog as well as dancing. (5) educate yourself. It well help you build a deeper connection that way you stay on track. If you get off track get back on You're gonna do great!",1,0
Also a quick tip for eating so much fruit. You should add a protein in otherwise your body turns it to sugar. So like banana and apple you should put it with peanut butter which is also a good filler,1,0
"Burrito bowls are amazing! Lots of rice, beans, lettuce, corn ect. !",1,0
"Gosh I hope she will not listen to people who says ""carb the fuck up and eat 3000 calories a day"" NO!!!! DON'T DO THAT! Just eat WHOLE FOODS plant based food like brown rice,potatoes,BEANNNS,veggies (protein),avocado,nuts,fruits and GREENS lots of greens!",2,0
"Oh, a vegan B12 supplement I recommend that actually tastes decent is from Natural Health Goodies (you can buy them on Amazon). Highly recommend so you don't crash. They are small, chewable and aren't nasty. If you are like me and are worried about getting enough vitamins and minerals (we aren't all perfect vegans!), Deva makes a good multivitamin that is quite tiny and easy to swallow (again, you can get them on Amazon). Don't forget to drink tons of water! :D",1,0
"FUCK VEGANISM!!! Saturated fat is healthy. It doesn't clog arteries. Saturated fat is important for the brain and it keeps cell structures strong. Saturated fatty acids are also needed for important signaling and stabilization processes in the body. Saturated fat is required for calcium to be effectively incorporated into bone. Saturated fats found in butter and coconut oil (myristic acid and lauric acid) play key roles in immune health. Excess refined sugar, vegetable oils and smoking are what damages arteries. The body uses cholesterol to heal the damaged arteries since cholesterol is important for tissue repair.",5,1

"Yay! I'm glad you decided to become vegan or at least give it a try. I've been a vegan since may. The hardest thing to give up for me was cheese and eggs since I am a huge breakfast person. The vegan eggs are really gross. However, aside from that, I've found tasty vegan versions of everything else. There are drastic differences in taste between brands as well. It can sometimes be a hurdle trying to find the artisian ( good) brands as I'm from the same metropolitan area you are originally from (Rock-bottom) (God, I hate this city so much, ugh!) lol. Anyway, off topic. It shouldn't be hard to find the good brands in CA. I saw that youtuber Vegan Gains made a video response for you. I think you should check it out.

"that's so amazing Trish! <3 I assume you've probably already seen some of Freelee's vids, to guide and inspire you a bit on how/what to eat on af vegan diet? Lost og fruits, vegs, rice, potatoes, beans, lentils, bread, pasta etc. also there's a lot of fake ""meats"" n stuff, vegan cheeses, plant-milks, soy-yogurts etc. there's a lot of options if you look around, especially in LA.

Eat lots of potatoes and rice and beans,1,0

My tips are if you slip or make a mistake by eating something not vegan don't beat yourself up! It's def a learning experience :) and don't make it a crash diet..

"Freelee's body is the result of over 10 years vegan and riding a bike 60km every single day! It took her YEARS to get that body, you may actually end up gaining weight over the next 2 weeks because of metabolic damage, rather than loose weight. So just be wary of that. I hope you stay vegan after the 2 weeks because you will notice that you will feel better and have more energy and of course you will be supporting the lives of animals. BUT in saying that you might not loose any weight.....",2,0
"get beans, lentils, rice, i suggest a lot of starches so you can get the satisfied feeling that you are use to, then start eating more lighter foods as you become more active and ect.

"Yaaaaaaaaaaass Trisha! I'm so happy for you that you're trying out the vegan life, I myself went vegan for a eek and never stopped because it's just so easy, refreshing and rewarding. My advice would be literally buy all the veggies (their natural delicious taste comes through more the more you eat them I find) and get into home cooking, but if not there are tonnes of vegan replacements out there, way more out there in LA than there are here in Britain. I wish you the best of luck and hope you enjoy and stick with this journey xoxo",1,0

"Yay Trisha, I'm so glad you're going vegan! The grapes are good, but if you want a significant source of nutrients from them then you probably have to eat like one bag per day. So I recommend not making the grapes into a meal but just having a few cups every day as a snack. The bananas are good as well! Very good! Just make sure you eat them when they ripen because the bananas you showed in the video weren't ripe, and that amount was good for like one or two days. If you really want to go seriously then those will not be enough for one day. Technically you are supposed to eat at least 10 bananas a day so take that into mind. Also freely eats like two or three of those bunches for breakfast. The carrots are a good source of vitamin A, but you should use those more in cooking than eating them raw just because it's better to get all of your carbs in, in the morning and then your vegetables are better later in the evening. Steaming the carrots, corn, green beans, and other vegetables you like and pairing them with brown rice tastes very good! Watermelons are a good source of vitamin A, C, and will hydrate you. But again the watermelon is better off as a snack and not a meal. Same with the cantaloupe. Most of the food you picked out is good for snacking, and not really for meals. You are going to want to pick up some dates, mangoes, potatoes, brown rice, almond milk (or any other dairy substitute), pasta is good, chickpeas, and lentils. It is definitely recommended you eat raw in the morning and most of the afternoon and then cooked food in the evening. If you think eating raw is too hard then just throw it all the fruit you want in a blender add a shit ton of water, some almond milk if you want, and some coconut sugar if you want. Also, look up vegan recipes you can have for dinner, and maybe even some desserts if you want. Don't worry about overeating as long as you are eating fruits and vegetables because you can have as much as you want without gaining weight. Of course, after eating you will be bloated, but it will mostly be water and after urinating your belly will go down. It's also good if you buy vegan multivitamins meant for vegans because if you are not very educated in nutrition you could end up with deficiencies. I recommend the Deva One-A-Day Multivitamin & Mineral. I am glad you are taking this step and remember to eat if you are hungry and don't worry about calory intake. You will not gain weight as long as you are eating right! And remember always to carb the fuck up!",1,0
You should eat fish,2,0
"hey Trish, it's so easy to eat vegan! i know you're doing it for health reasons and that's a great start! stick to whole foods the best u can and cut out or limit processed foods if u want to lose weight. also, you don't have to necessarily be an animal lover to be against animal cruelty. so the fact that you have cut down your meat consumption is awesome! and there are so many dairy alternatives that you're basically giving up nothing. you're just eating the plant based and healthier version. good luck and keep doing research on why going vegan is the best thing for your body, the animals, and our planet!",1,0

If you eat pasta with some low fat, tomato pasta sauce with some vegetables and potatoes, it's a really awesome and filling lunch or dinner. Do make sure you're eating enough!

"There's still plenty of foods that you probably eat daily that you won't have to give up, and any time you'd normally eat meat just replace it with a meat replacement like quorn! :-) Lots of crisps are still okay to eat, and lots of biscuits are vegan too. (Oreos are vegan!!) There's also a ton of yummy dairy free/vegan snacks in shops now; in my local store there's a whole dairy free section. (Vegan brownies are amazing, especially after being warmed up in the microwave!) Health stores normally have loads of vegan options too. Also, subscribe to Nature box or Graze box! You have the option to only let them send you vegan snacks, and their stuff is DELICIOUS! (Maybe you can get them to sponsor you too, haha!) Good luck, Trish!

"I've been a vegan for about 3 years now and I'm just gonna tell you it takes A LOT of fucking patience. The first month is gonna be like hell, you have no idea what to eat and you're gonna feel like shot sometimes but after that it's pretty damn awesome. I've lost like 10kg and I can gain and lose weight pretty easily if I eat the right stuff (unfortunately I love fried shit). My tips are that you should start with being a vegetarian and eating less meat, if you cut out all meat and shit like that at once you're just gonna binge on it later (what me and a lot of my friends did). Then you should eat grains and beans so you get stuffed and get used to the calories, oh and don't forget the bananas, you better eat a lot of them. The biggest mistake I probably made was threat I didn't really explore so much, I basically ate the same things everyday and got bored so try out new things as often as you can, it helped me lose the weight a lot faster too ( I have no idea why) Love you!",1,0
omg i never expected this. you go girl!! you'll feel great but don't try to go fully raw the first few days because you'll feel restricted and you'll just crash. good luck!!:)))),1,0
Try imitation meat!! You can season it however you want and it is so good for people who are trying to cut out meat. I've been vegan for about five months and balancing meals have been that hardest part. Carb up every morning!! Eat bigger portions of carbs so that you don't get weak from hunger.,1,0
"you just need to eat a lot of greens like broccoli , salads, CUCUMBERS, celery etc to get your digestive system going that way itll clean your digestive tract. drink a LOT (2 gallons) of water and ONLY water for your tummy to go down for the next 2 weeks and just cook healthy from home with goods carbs and keep the carbs low, and keep your sodium intake low atleast a week before the shoot that way you dont hold water weight and get all bloated. eat 1200-1500 calories a day just for the next two weeks and count them, you can use ""myfitnesspal app"" make sure you get your protein in because it burns calories and just hop on that treadmill for 30- 40 mins a EVERYDAY and your pounds will disappear!

"I really hope you can do it this time. Please remember it's a lifestyle, even if just for 2 weeks. It includes no leather, no animal products at all regardless of if its edible or not. When you are vegan, you need carbs, you need to eat plentifully. Eating small amounts puts your body into fat storing mode, never be hungry but eat the right things. Embrace the carbs, avoid the fat and sodium if possible. Vegan isn't a diet, it's a lifestyle and you won't loose weight in 2 weeks if done properly. First, your body goes through detox from all the animal products, then you may put on some weight as your body ajusts to eating well. In time, you will loose weight. You loose weight slowly but it stays off unlike a fat diet. In 2 weeks though, your skin will glow, and you will feel so good you won't care too much about weight anymore.

"I have never clicked a video faster. I've been vegan for around 2 months and it makes me feel and look so much healthier! Be sure to buy very dense fruits such as mangoes and dates -- water-based fruits have less calories and will leave you feeling pretty hungry throughout the day. Another thing you can make are vegan burritos with beans, rice, avocados, and you can add beefless crumbles if you'd like! I 110% recommend gardein meat substitutes if you begin craving meat -- their chicken tenders, beefless burgers, and pork sliders are SO delicious. Remember to carb the f*** up! Potatoes, rice, and healthy breads and pastas are your best friend (make sure to check the breads and pastas for eggs and milk). They do not make you gain weight but provide glucose to your brain and keep you from being hungry throughout the day. You should do a vegan Taco Bell mukbang!! Everything there could be made vegan; I love the 7 layer burrito with no cheese, no sour cream, and add potatoes and pico!! Xx",1,0

"Veganism is good for numerous reasons but you cannot expect ""a body transformation"" in 2 weeks. Your body might retain some of the food you are eating since you've been starving yourself & naturally more water weight because the fruits & foods you will be eating naturally have more liquid. You will definitely probably see results in your skin. Recommend foods: potatoes - they will keep you full for a long time & don't have any fat. Instead of frying bake them & put spices on it & find a low fat sauce you can dip them in if you'd like. Frozen smoothies in the morning- just buy those frozen mix of fruits you see at the supermarket blend with a bit of water or almond milk & maybe some vanilla I wish you the very best on your vegan journey üíóüíó",1,0

Avocado is very good and instead of dairy milk (which isn't nutritional at all by the way. I know I was fooled too) try using coconut milk, or silk Vanilla (which is soy milk) grilling certain fruits such as mango really changes the flavor and grilled watermelon would be perfect!

I do NOT suggest following Freelee's diet. Her diet lacks in omega 3s and many other things. Plus if you're just starting a vegan diet and all you can eat it fruit and potatoes you're going to get bored. You can't eat unlimited food either trust me I gained weight following her diet to a T. Check out the vegan corner and cooking with plants for some good recipes. I suggest using the website cronometer to make sure you're getting enough nutrients in :) (even meat eaters should do this). Also find a BMR calculator to calculate how many calories you should get in a day. There's also plenty of vegan junk food if you aren't in the mood to be healthy.,2,0

"*YAY! I am so proud of you! This is fantastic newsI It may be difficult at first, but you are stronger than you think honey! I believe in you! You just have to retrain your brain and way of thinking every time you put your fork to your mouth. I highly recommend you subscribe to The Vegan Mojo. He offers alot of amazing helpful tips that will help you transition over to veganism. You don't have to just eat fruits or lettuce. He makes food that you would normally buy at a fast food joint, but made completely from vegan ingredients. You don't have to give up your love for chicken tenders, burgers, pizza, tacos, whatever you love to eat, there is a VEGAN option out there! Just do your research! But I wouldn't recommend following what Freelee preaches. Honestly her diet is ONLY sustainable if you are an athlete who exercise ALOT. You will give up if going vegan if you stick to just what she eats. You want to take baby steps and ease your way into this lifestyle because you do want to be in it for LIFE. If you aren't eating the things you love and enjoy, you're going to want to give up. I know you want to do this for aesthetics, but the bigger picture is to do it for the animals. You know how those videos made you feel. Well it is the cruel reality of what happens every single day in the meat and dairy industry. Again... yea, meat tastes f*cking AWESOME, so for someone who has been eating it their entire life, would find a vegan lifestyle impossible to stick with, because they think they can only eat fruit and salads etc... But it is NOT true at all! Just do your best, and don't beat yourself up if you fail. Just start again fresh the next day. Baby steps. Ease your way into this lifestyle...because once you see how amazing your body is going to feel, you will be hooked! Don't forget to drink plenty of water too! Best of luck sweetie! I am ""rooting"" for you :D*",1,0

"First of all, congratulations! Your body won't magically transform in two weeks, but you'll feel so much better and you'll see differences in your skin and overall health! Before I went vegan, I struggled with multiple eating disorders. I still struggle, but the vegan lifestyle lets you eat in ABUNDANCE... which your body wants because the food you eat is your energy. Stay carbed up of course, but also drink plenty of water. At first I started to replace animal products with vegan products such as: almond milk, go veggie cheese, earth balance vegan butter, bagels, daiya cream cheese, boca burgers, boca chicken patties, gardien orange chickn, oatmeal (with maple syrup & peanut butter) and vegan cereals. Humans are addicted to dairy and cheese so replacing them with a vegan option helps curve the cravings. Although, all the food I mentioned is vegan junk food, I just wanted to let you know that there is literally a vegan option for anything and that you're not missing out! Xo good luck!",1,0

(Maybe she did and just haven't posted them yet) I would be very fascinated to see how she did, what her temptations were, how she felt, and what her modified diet consisted of. Anyway, love you Trish! Maybe consider elongating the two weeks? I guarantee substantial weight loss results and an overall feeling of wellness. Good luck Trisha!",1,0

Very important: Don¬¥t just eat veggeies or otherwise you¬¥ll go MAD! :D Plus: You might feel like a drug addict trying to get rid of drugs. The body isn¬¥t used to it at first...that¬¥s why many people quit veganism fast again,2,0

"Trisha, you do not need to go vegan. Just stop eating so much heavy, processed food and eat a wide variety of fresh, organic food. Eat clean. Drink a lot of purified or spring water. Stay active. Rest. Treat your body well. Focus on health. You can eat a high plant based diet and small amounts of organic, pasture-raised meat, eggs and wild fish. But if you insist on doing a vegan diet, you need to make sure you get enough protein, eat a wide variety of food, get your bloodwork done, and consider taking a high quality multivitamin. There are great vegan foods and also lots of junk food. Stick to mostly unprocessed food. Organic tofu and tempeh, brown rice, quinoa, steel cut oats, leafy greens, fruits, beans, sea vegetables (like nori), sweet potatoes, avocado, etc etc etc. Eat well-rounded meals and check out vegan youtubers who eat balanced diets, not diets that exclude a lot of different foods like raw vegans. There are also good vegan protein powders like Sunwarrior and vegan meal replacement shakes like Amazing Meal which you can mix with vegan milks like almond milk and a little bit of natural sweetener like stevia, coconut nectar, pure maple syrup, or brown rice syrup. It would probably be best to find a dietitian or a nutritionist who has experience with veganism who can show you to do it the right way.",1,0

"When I went vegan I went into it fully unprepared :D I don't know how I survived, and that was 5 years ago when vegan food wasn't as available as it is today (I'm from europe) I'd suggest you to buy a lot of staples. Don't try to go 100% pure/clean and healthy because you will feel like a failure if you slip up. I know I do. So I buy myself a lot of healthy staples, unprocessed food.. but now and then I buy some prepared vegan spreads, bread, veggie burgers etc. So: pasta in all forms - whole wheat, white, from different cereals, beans, lentils (canned), mixed frozen veggies, buckwheat, mushrooms and a looot of fruit, dry fruit is good too when you have cravings for something, DATES, popcorn (if you have a machine you can air pop it), potatoes, sweet potatoes, brown rice, basmati rice, white rice, black rice, wild rice, red rice, oats, some type of plant milk (try them out), mixed nuts, seeds to sprinkle on your salad, soo lettuce of some kind (it's nice to eat salad once in a while). While I don't suggest eating oil.. it's good to have it in the beginning: cold pressed coconut oil is perfection when combining with tomato sauce :D virgin olive oil isn't bas as well but I wouldn't recommend heating it. If you have a farmer's market buy fruit in bulk because if you don't have ripe fruit around you won't desire eating it. Whenever you feel like eating something just google vegan _______ and I think there exist a vegan version of anything. Oh and the best and healthiest icecream out there is banana ice cream or nicecream :) The best thing ever. That is a must. If you feel lost then try a vegan online challenge, you have a lot of pages that you can sign up to and they send you tips on how to start, where to start, what to eat, where to buy etc. Good luck",1,0

Hope you continue this diet!! Also just wanted to say Oreos are vegan in case you want something sweet and Ben and Jerry's and other brands make vegan ice cream you can purchase.

There are a lot of vegan restaurants there, just do a little google searching. Over all when you have a craving satisfy it with vegan food. Eventually you will just want to eat more raw fruits veggies. Yeah and get used to reading all the labels on the package. Please do not do the raw food diet, it's difficult to get enough calories on that diet, and when you o into a calorie deficit you will over compensate and binge eat, it's bad! also not eating cooked food sucks ass.

"For me personally, I love starches more than sweets. Many vegans thrive on a fruity diet but for myself personally I enjoyed reading the Starch Solution, by doctor mcdougall. It resonates with me more. Just try multiple things, as long as you are eating mostly whole foods, you will feel better and be healthier. Make sure you are eating enough!!! Many people arent used to eating so much. But vegan whole foods aren't very calorie dense, so you need to eat more and throughout the day. Eat lots of veggies and fruits!

"Regarding the LGBT community as a whole, not every individual: This is all part of the homosexual agenda. You can be sure if not curbed, it will weaken our entire nation. I'm not at all hesitant to say I don't like them. I don't and it's their fault for overstepping their boundaries. More precisely, for their insatiable lust for children. I might seem to be off-base until you explore an alternate perspective. They have developed an obsession with presumed authority. First they presumed to tell straight people that because we don't understand them, and because we are uncomfortable with their relentless effort to integrate some form of conveying the ""Hey look at me. I'm gay."" message into everything they do, we are mentally distressed and need counseling. Then they advanced to corrupting every television program with some form of homosexuality. For example: I turned on Family guy one day (the last show I watched regularly) and suddenly Stewie was gay! To me, in a modern family the grandparents are ""baby-boomers"" and parents have tattoos and a mind that is not stuck in a 1930s time warp. A boy with 2 dads and no mom is my idea of a ""throwed-off"" family. Television stations do not have show directors to choose the shows they broadcast. They have programming directors who choose the content with which they will program the audience. Children are a large part of the television audience. The entertainment industry has no shortage of homosexuals. There are even radio stations (and probably television channels) that broadcast only content from homosexual performers. But if we try something like that, they cry because we have violated their right to double-standards. Now, their lust for children. They have demanded the children of the nation (which they cannot produce) be taught there are more than 2 genders. Not only that, but they want to tell the [other people's] children they can choose their gender. Leaving a child at home alone is dangerous, but it pales in comparison to teaching a child lies in school, where they go to learn the truth. But, let's go on and tell the kids the many genders homosexuals have created in their minds are 100% as real as the 2 that can be scientifically proven. Give the boys female hormones. Give the girls male steroids. There's no reason a 10 year old girl shouldn't be taught how to put a condom on a life-like latex penis, right? That's how the state of California sees it. (Are you starting to see their lust for children yet?) Do your best to convince yourself that will benefit the child as much as the sexually perverted pedophile. Give them all puberty blocking chemicals to allow them extra time to decide what they are. ""Honey, if you identify as a toaster, that's just fine. Daddy and Daddy will still love you just as much as if you were a pixie or a fairy. "" I believe in equal rights. However, when the population of an entire state is forced to accept the fantasies of the mentally ill as reality and abide by laws that mandate promoting the LGBT agenda by teaching children these people's delusions are reality, while ignoring the majority of the population (who actually produce the children) that is far from equal and ... Rights? What rights? Who gave them the right to lie to [our] children? Oh wait! Silly me! It was obviously their Fairy Godmother. So the result is that a champion female athlete is not only robbed of her status, but robbed of her chance to earn a scholarship and maybe a better education than she can get without it because she has to compete against boys who want to dress like girls. Some girls might rely on a scholarship to go to college. There have already been cases where girls in contact sports have been injured by boys dressing up as girls. What's next? You can be sure the girls are not the only victims though. They're just the first to take a hard blow. Those boys are in the spotlight now, but according to statistics, dark times are just a blink away. And all for what? It is nothing but lust for ""new meat"" that motivates the LGB... (whatever they are this week) to recruit children. It gets even worse. There is a new movement of people seeking to become part of the ""LGB..."" crowd. They have labelled themselves ""MAPs"" Are you ready for this? Minor-Attracted Persons. That's the long way to go about saying ""pedophile."" They believe it should be legal to ... as long as they have the child's permission. There was a time it was different, but today, the propaganda (outright lies), the self-promoting content in every form of media, and the aggressive recruiting campaign of the homosexual community has saturated every aspect of the nations' children's lives, thereby bringing them down to the same disgusting level as pedophiles. They don't care if these kids will become so confused and frustrated that they'll rent a gun and buy a bullet before they reach 40. No, I don't dislike them for their sexual preference. I despise them for the negative impact the children will feel due to their selfishness, lack of respect for the nation's youth, and for their presumptuous attitude and actions.",7,1

I don't care what they transition to. Even with hormone treatment they still have the muscle mass of males. They can identify as females but they are males at the end of the day and it is unfair for them to compete against women.

It's not about identity it's about being fair to ALL of the runners you want to be a woman good for you, but if you're saying you have no advantage you're disturbed. Now I'm about as non athletic as a skinny dude can be. But back in senior year during that pacer test I got to 42 laps and only stopped because I was running in vans (terrible shoes for running) and me feel were hurting. The rest of the dudes, say for one xxl member of the class got at least 22 laps. While the girls were averaging around 13 with only four making it past 20. And that's just endurance we're talking about. We had a girl who ran track 3 different years who reached 38 or 39 and my video game clad self out lasted her.

The sneaky part is how aware they are. They know they aren't girls otherwise they wouldn't have to identify differently than their gender. The minute you have to explain why you don't identify as your gender you simultaneously confirm your knowledge of your own biology. The true sportsmanship spirit would to be compete against your own biology and attempt to prove that you're still stronger than them,5,1
How did it even come to this. Living in clown world here. All the girls on the team must be so frustrated. Why participate when you know you have no chance of winning because boys are allowed to come in and compete in what is supposed to be a girls only sport.,5,1

Gardein is a really good brand. Their seven grain chicken tenders are my shit. They taste just like real chicken and you won't notice a difference.

"You cannot eat as much as you want. I am vegan myself but Freelee's brand of veganism is predatory. You are basically planning to eat straight up carbs and that's almost pure sugar. You will retain water. Make you a salad, girl. Eat some veggies. Bake tofu. Eat black beans. Veggies need to be the basis of your diet. Fruit is great, but it can't be the basis of your diet. Do not be afraid of packaged veggies or fruits- it doesn't matter if it's pre-cut. Eat your veggies, eat some fruit, eat some grains, and get your protein in. It's not a magic bullet- you still have to work toward a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Good luck!",1,0

For a treat the Ben and Jerry's vegan ice cream is sooo yummy. Cashew Milk is Bomb! Please be careful with the ""Raw Till 4"" diet. They promote an unlimited amount of carbs and that is not healthy. You need fats for Nero Health..like brain function and absorption of certain vitamins like K and D. Also you need to exercise TONS to burn up all that sugar. My doctor at the Mayo Clinic said that diet is not ideal for most busy working people. It does work for some people...but one girl Julia Boer gained over 100 lbs in 5/6 months. Eat everything in moderation. Eat as many greens as you want...but don't slam in the carbs like RT4 proclaims.",1,0

You can easily get your protein through beans, oats, lentils, even fruit has some protein so don't even worry about it! Plus we actually don't even need that much protein! There's also tons of Vegan products, vegan meats, vegan cheeses, vegan ice creams, find the ones you like, I already know you like vanilla almond milk ;) hit us up Trish if you need more help!! the only supplement I suggest u take is a small b12 pill, that's it.

"::pls read this lol it may be helpful:: make sure you take vitamin b12 and get all the nutrients you need, and you're probably gonna get cravings, most people do at the beginning of their journey:)) especially knowing you hehe, so i recommend getting fake meat products such as gardein products, they're soooo yummy and make your cravings dissapear:)) eat lots of beans and spinach and get yummy coconut milk ice cream, or sorbet stuff, it's my favourite fucken thing and ugh just yummmmm!!!!! and also, it's not an easy change, it's huge and takes commitment, but if you stick with it you WONTTTTT regret it!!! don't be afraid to eat a chicken nugget every once in a blue moon if that's what you're really craving, cutting yourself off completely at all times especially when you first start out may just make you resent the vegan diet even more!(for some people it's better to just go cold turkey(or tofurkey in this case)and that's cool too:)) you're still making a huge difference with this choice, and I'm so happyyyy:))))",1,0

Our teeth, jaw formation and intestinal length all prove that we were NATURAL herbivores before we adapted into eating meat to survive. (cave man days). I am SO THRILLED FOR YOU! You'll feel amazing. Just EAT A LOT. This lifestyle is in ABUNDANCE. So eat, eat and eat. Also, make sure you get your b12. Humans use to acquire b12 from the soil when we used to eat our produce from the soil. But now, everything is washed off and cleaned/chemically treated. So take a b12 supplement. However, some people don't believe you need b12 because our body makes an efficient amount. It's debatable. 39 percent of all Americans have a b12 deficiency and there's only 1 percent vegans so this definitely isn't a b12 issue! :) ENJOY THE FOOD!",1,0

The only tip I can give you is that in regards to gaining weight is lower the intake in sugar. Also not all sugars a vegan but regardless sugar is s big issues for new vegans who want to lose weight. They think because it had not animal products (which isn't always true) it's healthy but sugar is a weight gainer for sure. You can have sugar but try to stay away from vegan desserts. It's filled with sugar for the most part to make it taste good,1,0

Also, if you like ice cream, frozen bananas with a little bit of non-dairy milk makes the best soft serve ice cream that is delicious and completely healthy and cruelty free.

"Your body will likely not transform in two weeks, but eating mostly fruit and veggies will do wonders for your skin and digestion. That said, somebody else in the comments said not to eat only raw fruit and veg to start, and I'd agree, cause it will probably be too abrupt a change to stick to. If you seriously want to try out the diet and help your health and aesthetics long term, I'd start by going to vegan restaurants and trying well prepared vegan meals (even the ones with fake meats, cheese etc if you're adventurous) and eating fruit and veg at home. Also, it would be a good idea to allow yourself some vegan sweets as a transition. I'm not a vegan activist, and I'm not writing this to you because of your reach. I've been dealing with disordered eating on and off for the last 12 years and since I went vegan some 4 months ago, so much in my body and mind has changed for the better (yes, I've lost a bit of fat too), and I hope it does for you too.

Well Trisha there is a difference between eating vegan and being vegan. Veganism is a philosophy and lifestyle that avoids animals products whenever practical and possible. When you live vegan you stay vegan because you know that eating animal products is unnessary and morally wrong. I'm glad you are making great strides Trish. Keep it up and hopefully you can fully connect with the ethics from after hearing from other vegans! üòÉ,1,0

"If you are going vegan for looks, I would also suggest an hour of workout everyday. There are really great videos online that have helped me lose 10-20 pounds. You don't need to starve yourself, eating many greens are good too. For protean beans are the best way to go. But yes, healthy diet, no fast foods, and veggies and fruit, gluten free pastas, stuff like that. And workout 45 minutes to 1 hour. Will for sure help you loose weight and tone your body. Just remember that loosing weight and all that jazz will take time, but I 100% support I think going vegan is going to help you so much. And I wish you good luck!",1,0
"Also check out Supreme Banana, she's my favorite vegan youtuber. Super sweet and down to earth, not off-putting at all and she has a lot of ""what I ate today"" videos and helpful recipes and hacks that make it a lot easier! My favorite sources of protein are black beans, quinoa, certain greens, sprouted grain bread, and even good old vegan protein powder. If the greens are hard for you as they are for me just throw them in a smoothie or even blend them into pancake batter. So much easier to get them down that way!",1,0

"Hey Trish a vegan here !!! First off if you want to succeed you absolutely shouldn't even consider not eating as much as you want!!! The only way you are going to gain weight on a vegan diet us if you eat oily fatty foods so if you want to lose weight as quickly as possible eliminate all overt fats(avocado, nuts, seeds, coconuts etc. that most of their calories come from fat) also eat as much while foods as possible like ricepotatoes beans lentils, oats and such. Those are going yo make you satiated and full for a looong time. That packaged watermelon shouldn't even be a snack and it is not good a idea to eat it at lunch time bc melons have a high water content so they are best digested if eaten first thing in the morning. Otherwise you are going to be bloated and gassyüôÑ. For example you can eat fruit as breakfast, for lunch/ you can make potato 'fries' that you bake in the oven instead of dunking them in oilüòù, you can make rice stir 'fry' with loots of veggies and rice again no oil... there are endless recepies search around youtube. Also watch Mr&Mrs Vegan on youtube they are from LA and have helped me a looot to understand how to eat properly and have very educational videos. Hope you continue this after the 2weeks aaand GOOD LUCK üòö",1,0

Some tips that I find very useful are to surround your self with food vegan only so if you are ever tempted to go back to the yummy non vegan snacks the only food source you have is vegan food.

"don't eat light weight things like fruit and expect to fill up! u gotta eat potatoes, beans, rice, pasta, grains (this seems so lame and gross but u can make it taste so good) like you said how those brussel sprouts were good - veggies are good when grilled (esp. green peppers) let your body adjust to the new diet, you may gain some weight at first just because you're taking in more calories, but veganism will clean out your body and eventually you'll be down to your body's best weight. it takes awhile! if you're willing to try veganism (or even vegetaraianism without dairy) you will end up with clear skin and less weight! but for most diets to be effective, you have to exercise. that's why freelee is so toned. i don't know if you're even going to read this, but i'm really proud of you! definitely search some vegan recipes on youtube, it makes it so much easier and eating fruit all day instead of filling, fiber-rich foods will leave you super hungry and undercarbed ):",1,0

It is best if you do your own personal research and find out for yourself if this Vegan lifestyle is okay for you.

"I am not vegan or vegetarian at the moment but I have been watching your vlogs for a while and I have a few ideas that I think could help. I have noticed that you don't cook for yourself all that often(which honestly I don't either lol) However, being vegan, I hear that you have to learn how to cook or you will get really bored of the food you eat. I think it would be smart to look at a lot of the vegan restaurants or ""healthy"" restaurants around your area and find out what you like. If you do this, you have somewhere to eat when you go out and you can always post mate it when you don't feel like cooking. Again, I am not speaking from experience but I feel as though finding these restaurants will open your eyes to new vegan foods you might like and you would have no excuse to NOT eat vegan. good luck trisha!",1,0

Just pick yourself and carry on. What matters is that you're trying. Don't just eat fruits and vegetables though! I recommend Morning Star Garlic and Quinoa vegan burgers on a bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup and sour cream! Get some cans of chick peas, they are delicious. and Hummus and pita bread! It's so good. You can make a great meal with hummus on bread with fresh veggies. They also have vegan frozen pizzas that you can sprinkle vegan cheese shreds on it! Make smoothies in the mornings!

Well going vegan doesn't just mean changing what you eat it also includes Beaty products such as lotions soaps (bath bombs) and make up. For example her false eye lashes she uses aren't Vegan.

"My biggest advice is to start by eating ""normally"" meaning continue to eat the food you loved to eat before, eat on vegan restaurants, search for vegan replacement products etc to start with and get used to it, to not feel like something is missing, if you do good without it, don't , but make sure to eat enough carbs, proteins, fiber, calcium etc. Don't listen to supposed healthy diet that won't last long just as raw til 4. This one is made for people who want to maintain their weight or who have a hella fast metabolism, which I guess is not yours, just as it wasn't mine because I have always been ""rounder"" and this does'nt work for that type of body, meaning that even if I'm thin I will still be rounder or curvier. what works for me and people I know is just to continue eating normal and don't go with the extreme healthy vegan diets yet ( raw diet, raw til 4...) good luck üòÄ",1,0

even as a vegan you need to watch the calories you consume especially if you're trying to lose weight. the key to weight loss is to burn more calories than you consume. so if you eat 2000 calories on a vegan diet and don't get off your couch you won't see any results. either way I wish you the best and I hope you see a difference.

Pizza topped with tons of veggies and no cheese. If you want to stick to low calorie foods you can always make tons of salads. Whole foods carries a bunch of vegan salad dressings that are bomb! Vegan Ceasar, vegan blue cheese, vegan honey mustard, etc. There's also vegan grilled chicken strips that you can add to the salad or you can make wraps. Look into veggie burgers. They're usually low calorie and very filling. The Qrunch brand quinoa burger is so good and made of nothing but quinoa and vegetables. Quinoa has a ton of protein. You can made smoothies out of frozen bananas, other fruits and fruit juices. Add some spinach or kale for more nutrients. Good luck! Happy for you!",1,0

Whole Foods has THE BEST vegan desserts.. the Whole Foods by me has amazing vegan chocolate cupcakes that I def recommend if your's has some! i also suggest upping the fruit because it really helps with mental stuff (i got out of my depression on a high fruit vegan diet). Kate Flowers on youtube is raw but she has some super tasty recipes (like cinnamon rolls only made with fruit!) so def check her out! Costco has the cheapest dates which are a must have if you're going vegan. sorry for such a lengthy comment; i'm just super stoked! love you Trish and goodluck! <3",1,0

"OMG I got really excited when I realized you weren't joking. I recently went vegan myself & I will never go back. I wouldn't recommend going vegan right away, I went vegetarian first, while also trying lots of vegan food to find out what I liked & find good meat & dairy replacements. I've been on the road to veganism for about a year & a half & just recently went vegan. Just know you can eat anything as a vegan, there are vegan versions of everything, you just gotta find the good stuff. If all you eat is fruit, you will gain weight, unless you work out a LOT. It was hard for me at first, but once I stopped trying recipes from pinterest it got a lot easier lol. Check out channels like Hot For Food & May's Test Kitchen, they make amazing vegan food. Yesterday I just had my first vegan donuts for my birthday & they were amazing, so don't think you have to give up junk food either. My diet is pretty healthy, but I'm not gonna give up junk food altogether. If I can go vegan anyone can, I never even ate vegetables til I was in my 20's. Going vegan has also helped with some health problems I've had. I just started sharing some of my favorite vegan meals on facebook & you're welcome to check then out. I can't post a link, but it's facebook dot com /22nicolerenee & I have an album of vegan meals that I've been adding to weekly. There's only a few, but I'm gonna be adding a lot soon.

Also on top of that just remember that for a lot of people it does take a while to lose the weight because it isn't a diet that restricts and causes it to melt off quickly, it's a slow but steady weight loss.

The stat says that each person living vegan saves 200-300 animals a year (not counting sea animals). My family of three has been vegan for four years, so just my little family, we've already saved at least 2,400 pigs, calves, cows, chickens, chicks and fish! Imagine the many of us who are watching your videos now, what a difference it would make! When you can live happily and lavishly without harming others, you feel so amazing. I hope you've watched Cowspiracy (really cool to know all the other reasons and how you're helping the world), Forks Over Knives (you'll appreciate the health aspects changing inside), Fat Sick and Nearly Dead (the first season is very promising showing how our body/systems can heal itself of lifelong illnesses if we stop putting toxins in).

"Why don't they want to compete against the boys? There are hardly ever any restrictions that say girls can't compete against the boys, if they can qualify. This is a stupid as it gets. The end result will be 150,000 trans-gender women dominating women's sports and then everyone will just lose interest. If you are a girl, why would you do all that training when you know you have to compete against a boy with long hair? You can't win. Not even on a good day. So you drop out. This is the end of female sports. But I think it will be a good thing, because it highlights how stupid the whole argument is. If you want to wear a dress that is fine, but the dress isn't what makes you a woman, in the same way a suit doesn't make you a man. Those things are just clothes and makeup. Somehow we are now confusing clothes and hairstyles and makeup for ""gender identity"". It's absolutely ridiculous. Skirts never made a woman a woman and they can't make a man a woman either. I think it's all a devious plot to steal scholarships. How progressive is that? We've actually found a way, as devious as it is, to give scholarships that were meant for women to men. This whole thing is absolutely sick. I can't believe that any women especially feminists support this in any way. I've seen how soccer clubs handle it, and they will let the girls who qualify play on the boy's team if they have no place else to put them that matches their ability. But boys on a girl's team? Absolutely unheard of and it doesn't matter how you ""self identify"". Penis? Boys. So we can make this a lot simpler. Until your penis and nut sack have been removed you are a boy. Your hair doesn't matter and neither does your skirt. The Scottish men have been wearing skirts for years (they call them ""kilts"") but you don't see anyone accuse them of being girls because they are wearing a skirt (kilt). And trust me you wouldn't want to unless you are really good at fighting. The Scottish kilt does not transform the angry fighting man into a docile woman. Don't mess with him or he will mess horribly with you, kilt or not.",2,0

"They are great runners with a strong passion, but seem to have the wrong conception of the reality of their own true gender. I cant just believe ""yes"" means no just because I feel that way. Same thing for these two athletes, they cant just believe being born male biologically means they're girls because they feel that way. Feelings are important. But you cant use feelings to block facts. They are male, they have male parts, and have testosterone and they're physical features are male like as well. You cant just put on fake hair and believe that your officially a girl and run girl sports. It's okay to be trans, Its okay to change your body this way, but it is not okay to lie about your true gender if you havent gone through any of the true major changes at the moment. These two athletes have barely gone through any changes. I mean, it's quite strange the fact that I can just go up to my track coach with fake long hair and tell them I wanna run for the girls although I'm biologically male.",2,0

Because hormones (and if not), male bone density, muscle mass, larger frame, more physical force and stamina. There are also factors in our brain-wiring such as men are more risk taking and agressive, which would give them an edge. If you insist that men compete against women in sports, you are actively for eliminating women's sports. That's just what it is.

There's a reason they have the women's record and the men's record in track and field. One of the trans girls mothers commented during her interview, ""It allows her to be who she wants to be and that has more weight than winning a medal"" Not to the girls competing against her who are trying to get college scholarships.

I agree with the state rules of those 7 states. It makes the most sense. However I don't think trans people should be completely prevented from competing with the gender they are transitioning to.

Veggies veggies veggies girl. When I'm vegan I think of myself as a vegetarian with limitations. Eat loads of cooked veggies. You can do soooo much with veggies Broccoli steamed chopped in dishes Green beans garlic and olive oil or coconut oil Cauliflower Spaghetti squash as pasta Garbanzo beans are great they are good in a stew w/ vegatable stock or water beans tomato loads of fresh herbs chili powder garlic onion zucchini carrots etc I find that when you chose a healthy lifestyle like this it forces you to cook all your meals it's much easier that way fruits are cool too but it's really important to eat a veggie or two w each meal,1,0

Rice with steamed vegetables or homemade potato wedges were my go to during the first month of becoming vegan. They are super filling and really yummy! I wish you luck on this crazy journey. Keep in mind that eating vegan isn't the hardest thing. You will feel left out at times because people around you might be consuming animal products. Don't let that get to your head you're doing this for you! I can't wait to hear how it goes c:,1,0

"Don't be afraid to eat too much. Some people end up gaining or losing a lot of weight when starting out as a vegan, so don't expect to loose a bunch of weight in 2 weeks. It takes a while to make progress, so take it slow and be patient. It'll pay off and you'll feel and look great",1,0
"Here are my tips: Don't be shy to eat a lot; eat until you are satisfied! Yay :) Eat your favourite fruits & veg. Bananas, dates, melons and avocados are my staples as they are calorie dense, super yummy and versatile. For carbs, go all out! Rice, pasta, potatoes, quinoa, couscous, bread, cereal, etc. For protein, I love beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, peanut butter but there are lots more options too. You can find great ""meat"" options like the brand Gardein & Tofurky. Delicious! Also, give smoothies and banana ice cream a try; I'm sure you will love it. :)",1,0

"Hey Trish! I just went vegan too and I have a few tips: 1. Eat a TON! I started out counting my calories because I wasn't eating enough calories. I recommend mynetdiary (in the app store) if you want to count your calories. I once ate 2700 calories in one day. Don't be afraid to overeat!!!!! If the food is healthy, you can eat as much as you want! 2. Make healthy foods you don't like taste delicious. I hate bananas but if I freeze them, blend them up in a high speed blender with cocoa powder and almond milk, it turns out like ice cream!! 3. To start out, stock up on dairy free milks (Almond milk is my favorite), vegan butters, vegan chocolates, and vegan snacks to cure those cravings (they eventually go away)",1,0

"another parallel between you and I trish. i am too attempting to go vegan. i hate meat , dont like eggs, the only think im having a hard time with is dairy milk/cheese. I love me some fruits and veggis and nuts and rice and beans etc... my downfall is sugar, which technically is ok to eat when vegan, so i need to find some self control on that front.... The common mistake i am making is just like when you said you accidentally had starbucks that had MILK. You have to break the bad habits~! One good thing is that there is so many channels and websites out there to help you know what to eat..... I suggest before going to any ""food restaurants"" ie; taco bell, starbucks, cheesecake factory etc... You check out their menu ONLINE and figure out what you will order PRIOR to going. I know its easy to be caught up in the whole process, and order things that you used to order, or you get there and you dont want to hold up the line, so you order something without thinking it through. You have to remember that its easy to go vegan and stay fat (trust me, i know this, i too am about 200lbs too, and i too hope to get healthier through going vegan). French Fries are vegan, but when you get them say from mcdonalds or BK, they are soaked in salt, then salted again, and again, and again when being served, then the fried aspect on top of that... I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS, I JUST USED THAT AS AN EXAMPLE ... Usually.. Hardcore vegans arent vegans to be skinny.. they are vegan because they are against all animal cruelty.. then the health benefits are just a plus. You can get vitamins too to help you make sure youre getting everything your body needs. maybe freelee can help with telling you which YOU should take, while doing this 2 week vegan diet. Love you bunches trisha, and i know you can do it! DONT CHEAT",1,0

for going vegan try to stick with Whole Foods as much as possible for the best results eat lots of vegetables like piles of vegetables and eat lots of fruit too a great way to get protein in lentils and beans also edamame pasta or black bean pasta is very high in protein there are also vegan protein powders and tofu and Setian which is a made from wheat and lentlis and red beans. this product is very high in protein there is tempeh too and also nutritional yeast. also high in protein is chia seeds is around 20 grams or so protein for 6 tablespoons even though it's high Protein ist also high in fats it's a good fat but for plant based diet you want to keep your fat low don't consume too much of it. I hope this was helpful and I hope your journey is successful. :) i've eben vegan for 3 weeks now and i keep My Protein High because i lift and want to keep my musle and i don't really low fat.

"Larabars! They're super yummy and they're nice to have as a quick snack through the day when you're feeling peckish. I love eating rice with some potatoes and onions and other stuff, but going vegan is all about getting creative with your meals! The meat and dairy industry is so huge that it makes it nearly impossible to just go to the store & be able to grab some food without worrying if it's vegan or not. Whole foods will be your best friend!! Pasta is yummy and sooo filling, potatoes, rice, and beans are always great. Just be careful! When I started out vegan I got the same advice but for some reason I never thought to add anything in to my food to make it taste better so more often than not I was sitting there eating plain rice and getting full but hating what I was eating. Imagine if you just cooked a burger patty but didn't add any spices or literally anything at all to it and just ate the cooked ground beef. Not yummy. Same applies to vegan food! If you don't spice it up (pun intended) it'll definitely make you start to resent going vegan! I recommend following lots of twitter/instagram/pinterest/youtube accounts that are vegan so you can stay motivated and find new tasty recipes! I know I'm not the only one who's obsessed with those buzzfeed cooking videos so it's the same concept! You see something tasty, you want it! just make sure it's vegan. Good luck girl!! you might get discouraged at times but that's completely natural. Keep your end goal in sight, stay positive, and love yourself!! you can do it! <3",1,0

Educate yourself on the ethical, environmental and health benefits of a vegan lifestyle, so when people try to mock this cruelty free way of life, you know the ACTUAL facts (not the widespread propaganda). Buy in bulk e.g potatoes, rice, pasta, fruit, veggies, nuts, legumes, frozen fruit, plant milk etc. Lastly make sure you carb the fuck up!! Carbohydrates are not the enemy!!!!!!!!!!",1,0

Sugar is vegan, so are french fries... etc etc. You still have to be smart about what you put in your body. Same with amount. Watermelon has got an insane amount of calories and sugar per cup than other fruits. The sugars in fruit are also harder to digest and will turn into stored energy (fat) when you eat too much.

The Peta site helps me a lot with that stuff, they have some really helpful lists of vegan foods, so I'd for sure check it out. You have a huge following of people who love you, so if you do end up staying vegan, you would really inspire a lot of people to make the change as well which would make a huuuge difference!!

Though if you have been restricting for so long, then you might want to eat more than you need, which results in gaining weight, but this shouldn't scare you off since you need your body to gain that weight in order to cure the metabolic damage and increase your basal metabolic rate and eventually you'll be at an optimal weight for your body type Hope this was helpful üíïüíï",1,0

"Nonono, you cannot eat ""as much as you want,"" when you have the mindset of wanting to lose weight. Calories in vs. calories out. You need to be in a calorie deficit in order to lose weight. Eating food will not make you lose weight, no matter what any miracle website out there tells you. Find out what your maintenance calories are (the calories required to stay at your current weight) and then eat under that. There are 3,500 calories in one pound, so as long as your total caloric deficit per week is around there, you will drop a pound per week (which is healthy). Also, do not let these HCLF people tell you ""AVOID FAT. NO FAT."" You need fats in order to absorb certain vitamins and it aids in protein synthesis (which helps build tissue + produce cells). Make sure you're doing this in a healthy manner. Do more research and find out what it is that YOU need to do. I weight lift on a higher carb vegan diet (60-70% of my calories comes from carbs) and it works for me, so I can tell you that doing the lifestyle right will produce great results that you can stick to but if you do this completely blind you're gonna end up hitting a wall because someone turned you onto a vegan fad diet. Understand what macro and micronutrients are, what they do to your body and how they work in sync with others, make sure you're getting what your body needs (depriving yourself will put your body at great risk), understand calories in vs. out, etc etc. Just be smart about this and it will work, Trish! Good luck. <3",1,0

Bulimia.. so please don't aspire to her diet for the reason of obtaining her body. There are several signs on her body that give it away. You can tell she is malnourished. Her muscles are shrinking in her arms and other places. Also. If you eat a lot of carbs, potato chips pasta Etc you will gain weight but then again you're used to eating a lot of high-calorie food so just keep an eye on it with your scale at home. Good luck",3,0
"Oh gosh, I'm so happy to see this happening! Congrats, Trish, so happy for this big step you're taking! Some tips to get you started...don't starve yourself, eat until you're full, no point in over-eating, you can always eat later when you get hungry again. Buy tons of potatoes, rice, pasta, starches to keep you full, fruit to give you energy. Basically that's it. Whenever you want something more consistent, go for the starches. If you want energy and a light belly, go for the fruit, but do never ever starve yourself. Also, googling vegan recipes is a great way to see yummy stuff to eat. Check out Vegan Corner for easy, amazing recipes, aaand if you don't wanna cook, I'm sure there's tons of vegan places there, just ask them to not cook stuff with oil. That's pretty much it, hope it helps. I'm so happy for you and proud, good job girl!

"i hope youre serious trish! i have a chronic disease, a plant based diet was the best thing ive done to help myself. but it takes time. here are my suggestions, i hope you look into them! make fruit smoothies instead of drinking coffees. bulk frozen fruit is cheap and easy to use, full of antioxidants which you def. need. 1c frozen strawberries, 1 banana, 1c coconut water. same formula for anything. make 2, however many you need. couple it with fresh bananas with sunflower butter, add cacao nibs. make an oatmeal bowl with hemp milk and fresh fruit. breakfast is what powers your day, make it count. smoothies, and solid whole foods. fruit in general, bananas especally have been proven to enhance your mood. if you feel good and are thinking clearer, you will eat well. lunch can be large too. mexican food is fine, lay off the corn and gluten though, ive rrad they can cause inflammation in the body which you dont want. beans and rice are your friend. beans, rice, gauc, lettuce, tomatos, add hummus and veggies. like cucumber, carrots, celery, cauliflower etc. eat plenty of snacks. nuts are great, dates with nut better, hummus and veggies. salads are great too, add quinoa for protein, or chickpeas, theres a brand called ""chickpeaots"" (something like that) they sort of taste like crutons. olive oil, pink salt, and apple cider vinegar is a classic house dressing. keep it simple, and dont go hungry. this diet is not limiting, youll have things youve never had before and feel great too. if you wanna keep going after two week, look into detoxing, everyone if full of toxins and your body needs help getting rod of them",1,0

"I've been vegan since last May. It took awhile to convince my mom, but packaged food is OK. But don't be afraid to explore carbs and vegetables too. I also prefer to have protein shakes with almond milk in the morning. If you're afraid you'll be lacking some vitamins, it's a good place to start. I'm also lactose intolerant, so I will say that I haven't gained any significant weight since I was 13 (when I stopped having dairy) and I also stopped breaking out in acne. In the past 3 years I have gained 5lbs but I will also say that I'm much more muscle dense than I used to be. Also, take multi vitamins and possibly fish oil if you'll allow yourself.",1,0

Remember that you can have everything you loved before as a vegan! you can still eat waffles that are vegan (My fave) and almond milk lattes are bomb. Side not : oreos are vegan so if you really need something processed go ahead and eat them oreos haha. Just know that there is literally a vegan version of everything... Almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk, vegan eggs, vegan meat, vegan waffles, vegan burgers, and vegan SANDWICHES YESSSSS so you can still have amazing goodies as being a vegan.

Try adding more satiating carby foods like potatoes, rice, etc. Fundamentally looking at our basic animal cell, these cells get their energy from carbs- so don't be scared!!!

Try eating some sunflower seeds and other seed for protein, avocado for fat; when i make my fruit smoothies (add whatever fruit you want) I add kale or spinach to them, and i throw in 1 tablespoon of chia seeds, and I cook with flax seed oil instead of butter or other oils.

Sure the estrogen treatments will bring the testerone levels down. But even with that they're still going to have a lot more testerone in their bodies than the average female walking around. A lot more. And then of course you have the difference of bone structure. So of course they have an advantage. They're men. Saying they're transgender or taking estrogen doesn't change that. Their chromosomes are still xy and always will be. God bless them and I hope one day they come to the truth.,5,1

Whenever you struggle just remember this "" happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony"". If you have even a small amount of compassion for animals( which clearly you do) this lifestyle will make you appreciate all other species so much more and appreciate life in general. Just try to listen to your body, if you aren't hungry then don't eat if you are hungry then eat even if you just ate a meal. Don't expect to lose a ton of weight initially, your body (like mine) has a lot of metabolic damage caused from restriction and starvation that will take a little while to reverse. Be patient with the lifestyle and most importantly remember that it is a LIFESTYLE and not a diet. üòä",1,0

"Yay Trish!! I would recommend getting Vega smoothies. They are vegan, and when you're busy you can quickly drink one and they have 30 grams of protein and taste good! Morning Star Burgers (vegan type), you can try different vegan cheeses (they are getting way better). A lot of Cliff bars are unintentionally vegan, those are good especially if you are craving sweets. Almond milk is tasty. You can make vegan curry and vegan chili pretty easily. If you're having trouble sticking to it, just try to focus on reducing dairy and red meat.",1,0

"Yes Trisha I'm so excited for you!!! The tips that I have are definitely get in those fruits ands veg ( they contain mostly water and they are low calorie so you can eat a lot of them and feel full for a longer amount of time), but don't for get about your rice and potatoes!! To get protein I would recommend lentils, chick peas, tofu (you can season and cook it all sorts of ways). Oh and you need to try nice cream, its a must. All that it is, is bananas and non dairy milk; just put 5-7 bananas in a food processor with a splash of milk and blend it up! My last tip you just to look on youtube and the internet, search for vegan meal inspo! hot for food is a great channel to look at! and if you're scared of gaining weight just really listen to your body, eat when you're hungry, and then don't over eat and make sure its still clean foods!

When I get bored I switch it up. Lunch I typically do fruit and if I'm super hungry a bit of pasta and salad.

I'm not always eating them but When i make them I give everything a taste. Even with the junk in my diet I have kept my weight under control the last 4 years.

Experiment with tons of different foods and remember it might take a few tries to find ""cheese"" you like and other foods. Don't eat JUST raw fruit and veggies because you'll feel tired and run down and make sure you're eating a lot. Fruits and veggies don't have tons of calories (Freelee was right about eating tons of food with no guilt). Give veganism time. It grows on you. You'll feel amazing after a while.

"A *BIG* reason for you to go plant based, Trish, would be your mental health. I cannot STRESS how much it helped my mental health. All this processed foods and animal products you eat really do damage inside your body which has an effect on your brain chemistry. And because you barely eat REAL food (fruits and veg) your body doesn't get the nutrients it needs to be healthy. And because you often starve yourself your brain doesn't get the energy it needs. Truly, eating mostly real food and plant based foods will do SO MUCH GOOD for your mental health because your brain will get the energy, your body the nutrients, the inflammation in your body will lower. This all has a HUGE effect on your brain and thus your mental health.",1,0
"Trish, one thing that could help your new vegan lifestyle could be going on walks. I know one thing is, i joined a cross country team in 6th grade. I used to run a 30 min mile. But now i run a 10 min mile. Walking is a great step to running. Running has so so so many good things about it. Anybody can do it, no matter the size, cause i know i wasnt the skinniest in cross country. It can also improve your mood, and lastly it is a very effective way to be healthy. I know that if you do want to work on this and be able to continue it. You have to start slow and be patient. I know that i NEVER was near the front even when i was improved, but that doesnt matter. What matters is that YOUR time improved. If you do want to start this activity. I recommend first walking maybe half a mile every day for about 5 days. Then you try to run/jog a FULL mile. I remember running my mile for the first time, i would stop every 5 mins probably. One way to gain back energy but not stop and take a rest is just by slowing down. Even if you have to walk to gain energy back, your still going somewhere and continuing. Anyway, if you do want to do this practice walking, THEN you need to try your hardest to run/jog a mile. when doing the mile you need to have a timer going. When you are done with your mile and have your mile time, write it down somewhere you will always see it. And then when you go on more runs you can easily figure out how fast you've gotten, how long it would probably be to go an extra distance. I also recomenned getting a certain type watch (fitbit orsomething like it) or getting a app on your phone. One thing that gets me motivated to run, is getting new running gear. i recommend not ordering online the prettiest one by a over the top brand, but instead find a local running gear store near you and get you walk checked and feet checked to find the perfect shoe for your feet that will help so much! I hope you get to see this advice! Love you!! +blndsundoll4mj",1,0
"Some great vegan sources of protein are beans/lentils/legumes, especially in combination with grains like rice or buckwheat. Tofu is a good protein source. Seitan, or wheat meat, is also great. If you have time/interest you can make it at home very cheap and easy, but you can also get it at most health food stores. Eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables. Most of which, for the record, also have protein in them. I wouldn't worry too much about protein in general; most Americans actually eat close to twice the recommended amount in a day. It's pretty easy to get enough. Definitely do some research on getting the nutrients you need, because at first it can be difficult, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. If you're having cravings, there are some good substitutes for meat and dairy products that you can get, and vegan desserts are definitely a thing. :) There are so many great vegan recipes/recipe blogs online. You can find recipes for everything from super healthy raw food to vegan triple chocolate cake. Some of my personal favorites are chickpea salad sandwiches, stir fry, and fajitas. (And don't feel bad about getting stuff in packages. You don't have to o everything all at once. Start with what's easier for you.)",1,0

if u dont want to cut out dairy a good way to get rid of a huge pimple is to rub ice on it and then put some eye drops that are for red itchy eyes on it and the ice will make the puffiness go down and the eyedrops get rid of the redness this is a life saver cause on the day of my choir concert i was singing a huge solo and i got a pimple i used this trick and it went away,1,0

"Hey Trish. Dietary pointers from a vegetarian of 4 years and a vegan of 3: - Beans. _Beans_. Beans are high in fiber, essential proteins, other nutrients like iron, and amazingly low in calories. There are a wide variety of beans, the most recognizable probably being chickpeas (used in hummus) and kidney beans. Despite having a poorer stigma, kidney beans are absolutely delectable prepared right. I actually have images of kidney bean tacos on my IG ( L3ehind ). Anyway, be sure to explore the beans! There is inevitably going to be at least one that you find enjoyable. - Nuts. Though high in calories, nuts supply essential fatty acids. Walnuts are known to boost neuron activity in the brain. for example. - Pasta! Eat pasta. Pasta is extremely high in protein and caloric. It is a grain of course. Buying a pasta with the least amount of ingredients displayed on the side is recommended (the simpler, the healthier). Will facilitate finding a dairy-free product as well. Also a note: gluten-free pasta is actually calorically lighter than regular pasta. I don't require gluten-free products, but I enjoy the taste of gluten-free pasta. - For _dairy free_ cheese products and the like, look at brands like Earth Balance, Daiya, and all the others. Search ""Dairy Free cheeses"" and ""dairy free milks"" on Google. There's a wide array of milks for example, all differing in taste and consistency: soy milk. almond milk, cashew milk, pea milk, hazelnut milk, oat milk, flax milk, rice milk, hemp milk, etc. - Commercial sweets I know of to be coincidentally vegan are: vanilla oreos, nutter butters, etc. Look that up, too-- ""mainstream vegan sweets / products"" or even ""vegan junk food"". Obviously best in moderation. - Most chips are vegan.",1,0

"it's also okay not to put a label on your diet if this doesn't work out. instead of saying ""shit I'll start tomorrow that had dairy"" or ""I ate meat by mistake guess that's it"" it's not about winning an award for the longest streak of no meat or dairy it's about making healthier choices. I cut out red meat like 5 or 6 years ago and yes I've had a few slip ups by accident but honestly my body is so much healthier and happier when I'm fueling it right so don't worry about a specific label of vegan or vegetarian live in the moment eat what makes your body feel good and that will make all the difference",1,0

"The thing about vegan is that it's litterally no animal type food whatsoever, like no eggs, milk, ofcorse chicken, hamburgers etc. soups n tbings like that, and because you arent eating eat you definitely have to find a good source of protein, so like LOTSSSS of beans, and sometimes vegans will have to take protien supplements but have to watch what they are, other than that, just making sure you are balanced then you could probably eat as much as you want. There are also other ""diets"" like the ""kill, catch, grow"" method which is if you don't kill, catch or grow it then don't eat it, or there is paleo, or vegetarian, plenty of things to try, just really have to find what works for you so that if you want to then you could have it be a life style instead of just a few weeks type of thing :)",1,0

"So proud of you Trish! Its so great that you want to eat healthfully instead of starving yourself to loose weight. Please remember though that you might not loose weight within two weeks, and I hope you'll stick with veganism anyway. We all know that weight loss doesn't happen overnight and takes months or years, so please don't give up on being vegan if you don't see fast results. My tips for being and staying vegan are: 1. Fuck all the vegan 'diets' like rt4 (sorry Freelee), fully raw, etc. All you need to do is eat whole plant foods. By this I mean basically anything from the produce section of the store. Also beans, legumes, lentils, pasta, rice, oats. 2. Try new things. Find a recipe that looks yummy and make it, try to veganize your old favorites. Try the vegan meat/cheese alternatives. Know that there will be things you love and things you hate, but that's just a part of the process. 3. Prepare food ahead of time. Make sure you have something to snack on, or have lunch prepared before you get hungry so you don't give up and get fast food or something. This also applies to going out to eat. Research the menu ahead of time so your not flustered when you get there. 4. Read ALL the labels. Every single packaged thing you buy please read the labels. Never assume that something is vegan, companies love to sneak milk fat or skim milk into everything. 5. It's not just about you. I know you are doing this mainly for health reasons, which is completely fine. But it's so helpful to remember and think about all the lives you are saving by eating this way. When it gets tough, just know you are helping animals and the earth :) I really hope this helps you, Trish. I'm so happy for you! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,0

Gardein ""meat"" products are always delicious. Most realistic taste and texture in my opinion. Makes it easier to transition. My main advice: make sure you're getting enough calories!! Eat until you're full! You can literally never eat enough fruits and vegetables. Also, vegan junk food is a thing. Enjoy it, but don't make it a staple in your diet. :) Good luck!",1,0

Trish my advice would be to eat many meals a day to increase your metabolism and to eat a lot of fruit for your digestion,1,0
"hey! i'm a vegetarian, but most of the time in practically vegan. (I eat dairy maybe twice a week or so). And I looovee vegan food because you can get socreative with it! It's really hard for many people to transition, especially whn you're a meat fan and stuff. You were asking about other foods besides fruit that you can have on a vegan diet and I can give you some ideas whicha re totally delicious and most people who eat meat love these as well and don't realize they are eating a vegan meal when they eat these: pasta (prepared vegan in a million ways) bread (whole wheat is so much better for you're health and physique) sorbet (this is a great replacement for ice cream) Vegan Ice-cream (yup!! there is vegan ice cream made with vegan milks that taste just as good) rice (You can make veggie-fried rice) vegetable curry (my personal favorite) Quinoa (which is an AMAZING and super delicious protein packed meal. It can be prepared in different ways as well... cold, hot) Peanut butter (make sure to get all natural, or make your own at home by blending roasted peanuts w/ no salt. Don't add water) almond, rice, soy milk FRAPPUCINOS WITH SOYMILK (putting caps so you know you can still drink those fraps girl! just ask for soy milk, or rice milk!! nuts (walnuts, peanuts, pistachios, almonds!! These are great PROTEIN packed snacks. They also have healthy fats) cereals (check the package says vegan. and low sugar is the best option Vegan cheese (almond cheese resembles mozzarella) vegan yogurt (made with almond or coconut milk) acai bowls papaya bowls (with no yogurt) pitaya bowls hummus (great for snacking with crackers, carrots, celery, cucumber.. etc) mashed potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, etc (With no cream!!) oatmeal (cna be prepared in so many delicious ways. use almond, coconut, or rice milk, or water) .....So this is all that I could think of at the moment. I really hope you can get back on track with veganism because it's not only great for you, but also for the environment. My recommendation is checking out some vegan restaurants near where you live (do so through Yelp, or google it), so you can see how many different delicious options are placed on the menu and maybe you can get some ideas to cook yourself at home. Believe me, veganism is great and fruit is not the only option you have for food. And what i love the most about it is that you can get so creative with everything. Quick head's up: marshmallows, gelatine, and gum are made with grenetine, which comes from animal bone marrow (NOT VEGAN OF COURSE.. and quite disgusting). But there are vegan marshmallows which actually taste pretty good (vanilla-ish) and there's vegan chewing gum as well. There are infinite vegan desserts that you can make too. It's all about looking for recipes online (unless you are the most creative person on earth at the kitchen). I hope this helps a lot!! And I hope that you can last as a vegan now knowing that fruit isn't the only thing we eat haha:)",1,0

The most important thing to remember is to limit as much fat as you can and load up on carbohydrates. You'll have to get over your fear of carbs such as pasta, breads and potatoes and rice ( and of course fruit too, but that won't be enough calories for you long-term).

I would eat lots of carbs try to use no oil or if you do use any or vegan butter use very little (best brand is earth balance) but just try and eat simple like a bowl of pasta with sauce and some veggies or rice and veggies or you could home make sushi with jasmine rice and avacado or cucumber and it's so fucking good just keep it light and simple and if ur starving then eat!

"Sigh...Trish. You say you're done with trolling and want to stop making problematic videos and yet here you are. Going vegan isn't the same as a diet where you say you're gonna cut out red meat or carbs. It's a lifestyle. The lifestyle you like to live is quite honestly the opposite of everything vegans stand for. You literally just unboxed a bag made from dead animal skins the other day. The majority of your makeup, skin and hair care products aren't cruelty free. You're wasteful and harm the environment because of all the plastic cutlery and paper plates you use. If you want to get in shape guess what...you gotta work out. You gotta eat veggies and healthy proteins. You gotta cut back on the alcohol.",2,0
"Hi I'm a vegetarian. Here's some tips. Protein: nuts, nut butters, beans, lentils, veggies like broccoli and spinach, tofu.

"Always always be smart and ask questions when you go out to eat, don't buy animal products just because the rest of ur friends are. You have to keep motivated! And with veganism your have to eat a larger volume of food to get more calories because plant foods are less calorie dense... Which is sometimes the reasons why you can get full easier since ur stomach is much more filled up than with a small piece of meat at the bottom of your stomach. And also keep track of vitamin intake. You're most likely going to lack in vitamin B12 so maybe purchase a supplement or fortified foods to help overcome that. And also a lot of plant foods contain non-heme iron, which is harder to absorb than heme iron(in meats) but to fix that you need to keep up your vitamin C levels ( orange juice, vitamin gummies) in order to absorb it more efficiently. And protein should be fine if you eat more lentils and quinoa(especially quinoa because it is a perfect protein).That's my advice for u good luck!",1,0

"Alright, I feel like this needs to be said. I never comment on her videos, but I see more hate here than on any other channel. It's annoying because most of you don't realize that 1. she LIKES the hate. It's attention. 2. The hate she gets is perpetuating the ""on the kitchen floor"" videos, and anything similar. Trish reads the comments and sees the views and then she does whatever it takes receive that same amount of attention. 3. Most of you think that she's just a stupid blonde, but look at her. She will soon be approaching 3 million subscribers and she gets tons of views. She lives in LA in an extremely nice house, drives a G wagon, and has designer everything. Despite what you think about her lifestyle, the only thing most of you have to complain about her is her ""weight problem."" I'm not saying she is healthy by any means, and she clearly has an eating disorder, but she's at least aware of it. She clearly has some psychological issues with attention disorders, anxiety, depression, and she gets attached to things and people, which indicated an addictive personality (not to mention her past drug use). She has issues. So does everyone else. However, she works harder than most other YouTubers I watch. She posts consistently, and has a hugely wide variety of content. She's open on the internet, and if you actually listen to some of the serious things she talks about, she's more intelligent than you might initially think. I'm not saying she makes the best choices, and I don't agree with everything about this girl, but I can appreciate someone who takes this much time toward something. She works hard on her music/dancing, which isn't my favorite, but I still applaud her for keeping up with it. Anyway, what have most of you done with your perfect lives?",1,0

"Baby steps. I feel like you're doing it all in one go, and you have a lifetime of habits to change in order to fully transition. Give yourself a chance. I think that making good lifestyle choices like picking the right products to consume over food that is bad for your body is a great thing. I wish your reasons were less superficial, but then again, we are guilty of that. In my opinion, changing your diet around like this, should be more about what you enjoy eating that is good for your body and soul. Which doesn't always mean that you need to become vegan. It is entirely possible to live a vegan lifestyle, but the lack of nutrients that you get from animal products may affect you in the long run. You should consider yourself lucky if it happens sooner than that, so that you can try something else until you find something that works for you. Lastly, the argument ""we were never supposed to eat animal product"" is bullocks. Honestly. Just look at the structure of your teeth. Front teeth are sharper-edged to tear into meat easier, the back teeth are from grinding your food until you are able to swallow, which also aids your digestion. Herbivores, AKA vegans of the animal kingdom, have flat/dull teeth because flora and fauna do not require the shredding action of sharper teeth. I hope this is helpful in any way, and if I may ask, please do not follow all of Freelee's dietary advice, especially not because it works for her and she's super skinny now. She has no training or education on this subject at all. Please consult a physician and a dietitian to figure out what foods you should eat and which you should avoid according to your body type and the current state of your health. I highly recommend this last part. You should always seek professional advice from certified practitioners. TLDR; Freelee is full of shit. Eat the health foods that you genuinely ENJOY. Talk to an actual doctor AND an actual dietitian.",1,0

"Yeahh girl <3!!! Good luck. Going vegan changed my life in so many ways. If you remember me like 10 years ago I was a mess, although I photoshopped my pictures (lol), in person I looked like I was falling apart. I didn't realize I had a toxic effect from meat, I just knew it always made me feel lethargic after eating it (now I know I have a gene that gives me DNA damage from smoked and cooked meat when certain chemicals are released), I am also lactose intolerant, but was drinking milk anyway, and have bad reactions to simple carbs, processed sugar, and preservatives... I was 50+ lbs heavier, I had sleep disorders (paralasis and nocturnal panic attacks), ADD, mood swings, cysts, and a bunch of other issues.. I had no idea how sensitive I was till I started eating clean. I lost 50 lbs, and I felt better than I have ever felt in my life. No brain fog, so much focus, energy, and people were telling me at 25 that I looked younger and better than I did at 21.. It literally changed my life..beyond the little good karma vibes from knowing i'm doing a good thing for the environment/animals : )",1,0

"Dear Trish, I also come from the eating disorder and believe me since I am vegan - 1,5 years - no bingeing, no vomiting - nothing!!! The guilt feeling is totally gone. My advice: eat loads- raw fruits in the morning so you feel awaken and don't need coffee anymore (smoothies are great - dates and bananas will give you so much energy), and later (at whatever time you care for) cooked food: vegetables, rice, grains or potatoes - whole foods. Don't binge and overeat but eat as much to be satisfied. 2 weeks in very little, don't worry if you gain pound or two the weight will come off at some point if you eat well. I eat mostly whole foods but I eat junk food still around once a week or even more sometimes and I am keep on loosing weight anyway! It is a slow process but worth it cause you don't think about the food 24/7 anymore. Work out: but do not over-train yourself, even a walk is better than nothing. Watch Cowspiracy, Earthlings, Forks over Knifes and any other documentary you come across (on yt there is a new great one called SWINE ) - they will help you make an ethical connection. They work on your subconscious so you won't have to force yourself to stay vegan - you will effortlessly stop craving animal products - so it will be very easy to stay on that lifestyle. Last tip: if you make a mistake and eat something that had some animal product in it (like milk etc) don't beat yourself up!!! Learn from it and move on. And don't listen to people that will criticise you for what you are doing. You're amazing brave women and I support you completely! Fingers crossed for your journey to last longer than just this 2 weeks. I hope you will feel fabulous and change your life like I did. Loads of love and support from London ! xx Ula",1,0

"If you were interested in trying some fake meats I personally really like the stuff from Fry's Family, I'm not sure if they sell those where you are. You just have to make sure you check the labels for things because sometimes fake meats have like egg or dairy products. Just remember to try not to beat yourself up too much if you do accidentally eat something that is non vegan, you'll just know not to get it the next time round. Going vegan, even for a short period of time can be difficult for people who aren't used to it, so just do the best you can really. We're all here to support you. Good luck xx",1,0

Go to the doctor after two weeks and have a blood test and a check up and see how you're doing! Good luck!",1,0

"When I went vegetarian at 22, it was only gonna be for a month. After that I did NOT want meat anymore. I went full vegan at 25 and it was far easier than I expected. I suggest that you buy some of the faux meats and cheeses to help you transition. Don't eat too much of them though cuz they are high sodium. But it makes it easier to not miss meat and cheese. Lots of fruit and veggies! Don't be afraid to try things you haven't tried before. Broaden your fruit and veggie horizons. Just have fun with it. It is SO do-able. Good luck. Upload any questions you may have. I lost a lot of weight when I went vegan.

some of the best food ideas Ive found since becoming vegan were from FullyRawKristina,1,0
"Ok, I'm vegan. So here are some tips: 1. Make sure to eat enough calories, because what you have there isn't enough. 2. You can get vegan burgers or vegan meat and it's really good. Amy's is a really good brand, and their vegan mac and cheese and burritos are amazing! 3. Most of the time, Ingredients lists will say Contains: Soy, Milk, Wheat etc. at the bottom so look at that. 4. Look into the different meat, egg, and dairy ingredients. 5. Trader Joe's has AMAZING vegan options! They have really good dark chocolate and ""meat"". 6. Look up vegan versions of your favorite food. I really like pancakes so I looked up vegan pancakes and they are by far the best pancakes I have ever tried! Lastly, a vegan diet is a very nice amazing diet. If you eat enough calories, you won't be hungry at all, you have a sufficient amount of protein on a vegan diet, and you also learn a lot more on how to keep your body healthy and strong! If you don't want to quit completely on animal products, do it a little slower. I went vegetarian for 5 months and then vegan for a week, then back to vegetarian, the finally, to a fully vegan lifestyle! I hope you enjoy your vegan journey and make sure to keep all of us updated! xoxo, lexi",1,0

"Well done Trisha on going vegan!! It will do wonderful things for your body inside and out as aesthetics and health not to mention the environment and will be keeping your new feelings and actions in aline with each other towards animals. Here's some tips to help you. 1. CRONOMETER - This will help you keep track of your protein, carbs, fats ratio, calorie count and nutrition 2. Don't be afraid to eat! Eat, eat, eat! People who eat low calorie on vegan diets normally can't stay on it because they can't stay satisfied. 3. Wholefoods, fruits, veggies are you're friends and will improve your health however rapid change in diet, ex fibre and things like that can make the body go through a detoxification - be prepared for that! 4. If the veggies, fruits get's boring or your craving animal-products try vegan meats, chocolates, or vegan restaurants. Plus there are some amazing vegan youtube recipes. All you gotta do is look. It'll keep your creativity and tastebuds alive :) Might be best not to go hardcore for your first 2 weeks but to transition from junk food vegan to health food vegan. It will make it easier. Or at least find the right balance for you. 5. Veganism is a progression not a perfection. Just keep trying and the longer you go the more natural it will become :)",1,0

Going vegan is a lifestyle change so it will take a bit of time. Cut things out slowly so you don't go cold turkey and end up reverting back to eating animal products. Grains such as rice and quinoa and fruits and vegetables and beans are my go to's. But there are so many vegan fake meats out there so if you're craving it go for that. Also Oreos and diary free Ben and Jerry's are always there if you need a sweet fix!,1,0

We have a shop called Holand and Barents and you can get vegan butter and manny things that are vegan and if you want protein I recommend you getting wheat grass and there are manny things that you can get and by being vegan you will feel more energetic and fit . And there are a lot of vegan thins that you can get From Holand and barrats,1,0
You shouldn't be worried about over eating! you really need to make sure you get all the vitamins and nutrients that you'd normally get in dairy and meats such as proteins and vitamin B12. I recommend getting some nut/oat/soya milk with no added sugar and also non dairy butter to make the diet easier! also make lots of lentil/pulse soups which are really yummy and filling! good luck!,1,0

"I did the same thing you're doing about proclaiming it out loud. I was stuck in a pescetarian phase for almost a year, really struggling to make the commitment to veganism. So at work I told everyone I was vegan from that day on, and so I was. It definitely helps to put it out into the world. I lost 30 pounds in the first four months of going vegan, and even though it wasn't my goal to lose weight during this process, it is a SUPER bonus. The first two weeks is a bit of a struggle, but after that as long as you eat well and nourish your body, it'll be the BEST decision you've ever made! The best advice I can give you is that if you mess up, allow yourself to move on. A lot of people feel like if they messed up once then it's hopeless and they want to stop being vegan. You just have to accept the fact that it's an entirely new lifestyle you have to get used to, and you will accidentally eat things that you wouldn't even think weren't vegan. Just take each moment as a learning experience and enjoy your journey!",1,0

"Trish this is so amazing! I'm so excited for you! From one vegan to a now vegan, in my opinion, any reason to change your diet to veganism is a good reason. I went mostly for ethical reasons but losing weight and toning up happens regardless. If you're trying this out for two weeks in order to feel a little slimmer for your shoot, try to only drink water. Lemon water will help a ton to lose bloating that might occur when increasing your vegetable/fruit intake. EAT WHEN YOURE HUNGRY. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT RESTRICT. Freelee is RIGHT you can eat as much as you want if youre eating a plant based diet, raw or not. The first week you might be a little gassy or a little bloated but don't let this discourage you!! By the end of week two your body will have adapted a lot more to the new diet, so you should be waking up looking nice & tight. I hope you see this as I want you to be successful in this as it can be a total and complete game changer. Quinoa & beans and any dark green vegetable will be high in protein, I encourage you to look up vegan recipes to play around with! It's fun. And don't be afraid to try different vegan restaurants in your area! They can open your eyes as to how wonderful food on this lifestyle can be.

"Good for you, girl! - tips; be open to the fact that the vegan version of foods isn't supposed to taste exactly like the animal version. ""Chicken"" nuggets are their own delicious treat. As is coconut yogurt, soy milk, soy cream, vegan cheese, vegan cookies. Also most bread, pizza dough, crackers, etc are vegan. If you want delivery pizza, order it with sauce and veggies and add your own vegan cheese or toppings. At Starbucks ask for soy milk or coconut milk instead in fraps or any drink. Sorbet ice cream is dairy free. Oreos are vegan. There is a vegan version of just about any food- and it's fun to try. ALSO- there are so many vegan tumblr blogs with a ton of ideas and simple recipes- that really helped me when I went vegan. Finally, do it at your own pace. If you have a set back and eat an animal product, don't condemn yourself and let it turn into a binge. Forgive yourself and continue on! Hugs xo",1,0
Make sure to get some actually satiating foods like pasta and beans so you're not only eating fruit. Also you can add TVP to things for more protein. Also make smoothies with lots of greens.,1,0

If you get a craving don't worry you can veganize anything!! Trust me cauliflower chicken wings are life changing!! Remember most of the weight you will be loosing will be water weight so don't worry if you don't see much of a change. Eat what you like!! Sometimes I eat 3 potatoes in one meal. Eat until your full. Buy vegan substitutes like earth balance butter, you can get vegan hamburger patties, vegan mayo... I even got coconut milk whipped creamüòÇ and it was amazing.

"Wow... This is great! My tip would be to eat as much as you want within a meal (avoid snacking between meals), and don't be too fanatical about exactly what it is you're eating (i.e. how ""healthy"" it is) - as, if you can find things you enjoy and also make you satiated, the longer you're going to stick with it, and actually become less obsessive about what you're ""missing out"" on. Also, don't worry about what others think or say about your choices, just know within yourself - and be happy within yourself, that you are doing this for the right purposes. :)",1,0

Freelee lost all her weight when she was totally Raw Vegan.. She got slim as a Raw Vegan. Then mentained her slim body with RT4. But now she is not necessarily doing RT4 but she is still vegan.. No No NO you can't eat as much as you want on a vegan diet you will get FAT. So many people have got FAT on RT4. You need to eat less on to lose weight and you have to do cardio. You will gain weight if you follow RT4. You need to find a vegan diet that helps you to cut. look for a vegan body builder and follow the diet they use for cutting. You need some professional help. Check our Jon Vegus he is a vegan body builder his girlfriend Katherine is a trained Nutritionist and does meal plans and coaching for people like your self.

"THE ONLY REASON WHY FREELEE CAN EAT AS MUCH AS SHE WANTS IS BECAUSE SHE HAS A TON OF LEAN MUSCLE MASS. THE MORE MUSCLE MASS ONE HAS, THE MORE CALORIES THEIR BODY BURNS NATURALLY. THIS IS WHY BODY BUILDERS HAVE TO EAT SO MUCH. TRUST ME. I WENT ON RT4 AND A REGULAR VEGAN DIET WITH NOT VERY MUCH MUSCLE MASS, ATE AS MUCH AS FREELEE RECOMMENDED, GAINED 20LBS. FREELEE CAN EAT HUGE AMOUNTS OF FOOD BECAUSE OF HER LEAN MUSCLE MASS. MORE MUSCLE MASS=MORE CALORIES BURNED NATURALLY BY YOUR BODY WITHOUT EXERCISE INCLUDED. DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE BY STUFFING YOUR FACE AND THINKING YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE WEIGHT. EAT WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT UNTIL YOU FEEL FULL AND SATISFIED. SIMPLY EATING LIKE SOMEONE LIKE FREELEE, WITHOUT AS MUCH LEAN MUSCLE MASS AS HER WILL DEFINITELY HAVE YOU GAIN WEIGHT. I'VE BEEN THERE, AND LOST ALL THAT WEIGHT BY EATING HOW MUCH I ACTUALLY NEEDED TO, ACCORDING TO HOW MANY CALORIES MY BODY BURNS ON ITS OWN. PLEASE STILL CARB TF UP, DON'T STARVE YOURSELF, EAT SNACKS THROUGHOUT THE DAY, AND YOU'LL BE SURE TO LOSING WEIGHT AT A HEALTHY PACE. DON'T STRESS OVER OIL OR FAT OR SODIUM. BABY STEPS.

I hardly ever get stomach aches and feel bloated, only when i eat a lot of candy or whatever. It was honestly such a fantastic idea and there are meat alternatives sold in so many stores, like trader joe's and such made from plant protein that i eat, it is so good for cravings you might have at the very beginning of this life style, there's vegan chicken and beef believe it or not, some have eggs and dairy but others are completely vegan and you can find vegan foods in organic type grocery stores like sunflower market and stuff like that.

"This got me thinking about intersexed people.... have they been allowed to compete? I mean, if someone is born both sexes, then they might have an unfair advantage or not, depending where they get placed to compete, men's or women's sports. I believe what used to be done in this situation was to just throw them into women's sports. I do remember some news stories about this and I have to say, it is rather unfair. It's not only unfair to the women but to the intersexed as well. It would seem a solution would be start another division for intersexed, but with so few births being so, who would fund it? On top of that, it wouldn't be fair for transgendered to be thrown in with the intersexed division because of who's taking what hormone could have an unfair advantage. So would a fourth subset for transgender athletes be needed? Again, who is going to fund it? It gets kind of crazy. The transgender thing is one issue, but what about those who are intersexed? This idea of sports competition seems more legit because intersexed people aren't ‚Äúchoosing‚Äù to be another sex like how it is said about transgendered. Should sports be off limits to the intersexed and if so, wouldn't that be unfair? So technically, this is the same problem, different issue.",2,0
"It is truly fair to exclude them from competing in women sports. People that say men can be changed into women are plan idiots. They can take all the hormones they want, in the end they are still male. Their natural default is male. They were born male. They should not compete as women. It come be the only way for them to win. It's likely they were losing to makes, so hey let's identify as male and compete with women. This generation is full of depraved idiotic people.",5,1

Males and females have completely different bone structures. Males have larger hearts, lungs, arteries, veins, tendons, etc. No amount of hormone treatment can neutralize all of these differences.

"This is unfair, i have participated in provincial track and field meets and this is simply unacceptable. Firstly, they started taking testosterone suppressors in 9th grade, which means they had a male muscular and bone growth for 14, the majority of their lifes. Secondly, the ¬´ girl ¬ª who came first in the state championship 100 m dash had a 12.66 s run which is easily 1 to 1.5 sec over the average qualifyers for state (male). This clearly demonstrates that if they were to participate in the male races they would not even come close to qualifying for state and on top of that taking the 1st and 2nd place.",5,1

"Maybe the cisgendered women should boycott competing until transwomen get their own race. Then there won't be a competition to race in anyways, for anyone until something changes. Cis gendered women need their own category, period. I also find it disgusting that people have reduced women to the level of estrogen or testosterone found in the body. It takes much more than just hormone levels to create a woman. After puberty, everything from bone density to size and other important changes happen. Oh yeah, remember the menstrual cycle? That too. Women athletes often have to train so hard that they can even lose their periods which is unhealthy. And transwomen who have not been through cisgendered female puberty say that if they just make sure the testosterone in their body is at a low enough level, that they are biologically women and should compete with them? This is madness. Hormone therapy is there to help someone FEEL like they are a woman, it cannot actually turn you into one biologically. It will not make you turn into the woman you would have been had you been through a FEMALE not MALE puberty. I think trans people should be protected against violence, but they are still not technically the women or men they feel that they are and do not need to be in the same category for sports. Why can't there be a transgender competition. This is not like getting to use the ladies washroom. That helps transwomen feel safer, far away from potentially abusive cisgendered males. This is about competing with cisgendered women. Scholarships are on the line here. Biology matters.",2,0

"I subscribed after the 2nd video I watched... just to make sure it wasn't a one time deal. In the late 80s I found myself with many gay friends. And I would have considered myself a strong proponent for the gay community and for transgender people. I served in the military for 20 years and I have met many gay sailors. This was before don't ask don't tell. I didn't agree with a lot of the rules etc. I really don't think that a persons sexual preference is anyone's business and the gays that I knew ... everyone knew and no one cared. They were professional and were every bit a sailor some better than I was ... a hetero fem. one of my best friends was drag at night. Like I said no one cared. In the 90s I used to get really pissed off at women in bars who would dance and make out with each other in bars to pick up men. Of course this was my opinion but lesbian and gays have fought the good fight for equality and here are women playing lesbian just for a one nighter. I never asked a lesbian how they felt about that but for me I felt like it was a slap in the face of lesbians who have been locked in the closet but now it's cool to act lesbian. To me it was making a mockery of the being lesbian; like playing lesbian as a convenience to get what you want is ok, to me it wasn't. I may not be entitled to an opinion as I have not lived as lesbian or trans. Skip to the bathroom situation, I am not sure about how schools handle it so I can't comment. I fully supported same sex Union. I felt it was bad judgement for the LGBTQ community to force the world marriage on mainstream. I more than likely did not fully understand why they needed to use the term marriage. In my opinion had the LGBTQ community asked for something that should be legal for everyone to engage in a civil union for legal reasons like insurance custody etc., thing would be better for the LGBTQ community today. Then the focus on transgenders, and public bathrooms. I think this whole mess really put the transgenders back to square one. Now society has the opinion that transgender = some of the crazies I've seen in your videos. Like I told my friends back when Obama was threatening Roy Cooper and the crap that went down in North Carolina, transgenders have been around for many many years and they have been using the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù bathrooms and no one knew. I honestly don't thank any truly trans woman has a beard or any facial hair. From what I know about a trans male to female, that facial hair would feel like acid on there face. It just wouldn't be there. Miss White I had no clue you were trans, just another beautiful girl. I know there are some trans folks who have not had access to some of the medical treatments you may have had access to but if there are males transitioning to female there are many no medical things a person can do to alter your appearance. I used to have a very short hair cut and I'm not for everyday very feminine so I have been mistaken as lesbian a few times. I know this is a rant but I guess I'm writing because maybe someone will read this and understand that most main stream people don't hold hatred against lesbian gays and transgenders; but the problem is that this has become twisted and perverted and this has became forced on the country. And from experience I don't and I don't think anyone else wants to be forced to accept some of the things the LGBTQ community is pushing. Anyway love your show and I wish you all the best and I appreciate that you have your show to educate folks like me and folks not like me!",2,0
"I agree with you. I'm a born female and I dont wear makeup or do my hair every day. I'm literally sitting here in sweatpants, a tshirt I bought from the men's section and ugg boots with my hair yanked up in a ponytail and no makeup. So according to Miss Trisha over here I must be trans and a drag queen. Other people have told me I must be gender fluid or something because I like certain things and act certain ways so I must want to be a man. Which isn't true.

"I've been watching Trish for like, a long-ass time. I'm just really, really concerned about her mental health. Like I was already concerned, and now I'm doubly concerned. To me, that's all that's really going on here. Someone needs to intervene and get her some serious help- and she needs to stop hanging around enabling people who just go along with whatever she says or does. Real-ass people tell you when you need to shut up and tell you when you're full of shit (nicely but firmly). I don't think she has that person and she's left with her mind- and for someone who's really mentally ill and untreated, being left with your mind is a terrible, terrible scenario. I really hope she gets help and that big youtubers don't CONDONE this by automatically agreeing with her statements to get some kind of clout for being a trans-ally or whatever.

It is always entertaining the mental gymnastics the trans YouTubers present. Males impersonate females and want to date males ... the shortcut is they are actually gay. Females impersonate males and want to date females ... the shortcut is they are actually lesbians. The idea that children are born with an innate ‚Äògender identity' which develops pre-natally and is impervious to environmental influence is not supported by any credible science. Body and brain are interconnected; scientists have found no separate innate ‚Äògender' area of the brain which is fixed at birth. Children's brains are very plastic; they develop through interaction with people and the environment and they are constantly absorbing information and influences which shape them.,2,0

I think you should perhaps rethink what her message was. I don't think comparing it to being transgender or your transgender experience is entirely accurate just because I don't think she knows exactly what the term is. But regardless she is struggling (has hinted towards it for years) and it does a lot more harm than good by invalidating someone else's difficulties just because it doesn't ‚Äúseem‚Äù to make sense.

"Serious question: If gender is a social construct then can't she say she is transgender? Wouldn't we have to believer her? Because gender can be anything. If she were to say she is TRANSSEXUAL, then I understand that she is crazy and trolling. My understanding is that transgender is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and maybe dresses or acts as such, but transsexual is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and takes steps to medically transition. Just trying to learn! Thanks :) Edit: so is transgender even a thing then? If you are just changing behavior/clothing/style/personality that doesn't have to be a change from one gender to another. If it were a change from one gender to another, doesn't that just prove that masculinity and femininity are linked to sex. Idk. This entire community is confusing to me.

As someone who has struggled with opiate dependency due to chronic and deteriorating issues within my spine that was negatively impacted by this hocus pocus bullshit narrative spun by the government across media increasingly so over the past six to seven years in addition to losing several friends and family member because of overdoses because they were strong armed into illegally sourcing opiates which ended up being this imported Chinese super fentanyl fancily made to appear like their normal medication that had previously helped them have any sort of quality of life but was ripped away from them because of a god damn government experiment.

Also, the point about men and women's common major choices is irrelavent because, as confirmed yourself in the beginning of the video, the issue is getting paid less for the SAME JOB. - her final point, men are more likely to work more hours, doesn't debunk women getting paid less for the same work for the SAME HOURS, now does it? thanks for pretending you're going to address the issue for what it is and then dancing around it.",1,0

"*This isn't sexism, it's just common sense.* My new favorie quote.",2,0
"I have never taken into consideration the gender wage gap that seems to exist today. So when the discussion came out during of our classes, I was most definitely caught off track and honestly bothered. In the YouTube video, ""There Is No Wage Gap"", it gave us a bit of sense of why men are paid more. Due to education, occupation, position and hours, women are paid 0.77 in comparison to every $1 that a man makes. Women are seen to have to juggle being moms, with responsibilities inside and outside of work. Basically, women are viewed as weak. The video made it seem that women aren't as capable as men when it comes to working long hours especially at a last minute timing. Women however, are not weak. I know that they do take more responsibilities than men when it comes to their children, but just because women are capable of taking on more roles, doesn't mean they should have to face a wage gap. When it comes to education, I strongly believe everyone should be paid equally. Yes people get paid more for their seniority at a job, but that is due to them having worked their way up there either by being their for such a long time or simply because they do their job right and get promoted. In the end, everyone should start off by getting paid the same in any career they have. The YouTube video and the reading we had assigned for homework, ""Sheth and Gould (2017)"" includes a graph, and tries to use that the excuse for this wage gap, is due to women choosing low paid college majors, leading to low paid jobs. In a sense, I see how it is true. Women go for ore of the ""motherly"" careers and I think that's how we women are seemed to be. This gender wage gap does exist and some of its reasons provided in the video, seem reasonable. In the end however, the wage gap shouldn't exist no matter the circumstance.",1,0

Mostly because of not willing to work long/graveyard shifts, pregnancies, prioritising family over ovetime, the difference in pay if you work for the private or official sector, and people under 35 tend to earn less than their peers, no matter the gender. There is still a big gap though. Taking the electricians in Norway as an example, with the same age, education, employer and work hours, there is still a gap of 6300kr (750USD) per month.

It should be a factor, but combined with aptitude, interest, benefit to society, etc. to ensure people are contributing to society to the best of their individual ability. If the data given here is correct, the question still isn't ""why do women choose lower paying jobs?"", or ""why do women value more things over their job?"".

"I found this video very interesting. I know that in class we discussed how the wage gap is ""77 cents to every dollar"", according to the statistics in the article written by Equal means Equal. However, that didn't necessarily specify how these came about. For example, Chrisitna Hoff Sommers breaks it down in her video, ""There is No Wage Gap"". She says that this is just based off the median income of women and men. I liked that they used median, because this gives an accurate representation of the situation. Using an average would just mess this certain statistic up. However, she did bring up a statistic from an organization that is feminist that says the wage gap is only about ""6.6 cents"", when all factors are included. These factors include things such as what job they have and how many hours they work. I liked how she pointed this out and set the record straight on this statistic. However, after reading the article ""What is the gender pay gap and is it real?"", by Elise Gould, Jessica Schieder, and Kathleen Geier, the wage gap is looked into further. The article has numerous statistics but ""Figure K"" really stand out to me. People always argue that there is a wage gap because of the education level between men and women. However, this chart showed that even at the same education level men make more than women on average. This statistic is very useful because now men and women are in the same level and men still make more than women. Overall, all these sources are helpful. I think that there is no doubt a wage gap because there is just so much more evidence to prove there is a wage gap then to prove there isn't one. I did find the video interesting because she does have solid claims to back up her point.",1,0

I think some of the gap can be down to how well men & women negotiate. I have a totally awesome & strong female friend who recently negotiated salary for a new position and she just couldn't push hard on the salary.

"This video proved to me that there is a gender wage gap. In the example of the Georgetown University 5 top paying majors and 5 least paying majors, the 1 out of the 5 top paying majors dominated by women was pharmaceutical science, and 4 out of 5 lowest paying majors dominated by women were counseling and psychology, early childhood education, human services and community organization, and social work. I think one of the variables that needs to be taken into account is a female's NATURAL APTITUDES and their value to society. For example, the history of stenography and secretarial work demonstrates the history of how a once male-only profession became available to women, but at the cost of lower pay. Because they could. Secretarial work and stenography was only a male profession. Colleges that taught these subjects only admitted males. Historically, this is the recent past. If you go far back in history, the work of scribes, a once highly honored position, was also the work of males. From the book, ""Out of the Kitchen and into the Office"" by Lynn Peril: A Case History of Poaching Jobs from Men Unlike typing, stenography had a long history of male practitioners. In 1906, the author of Starting in Life: What Each Calling Offers Ambitious Boys and Young Men warned his readers that, save for the as yet mostly male bastion of the newspaper office, the woman stenographer had ‚Äúbecome an office fixture and necessity.‚Äù Women had even infiltrated the ranks of court reports, where they had been long considered too delicate to hear the litany of greed, murder, lust, and corruption, not to mention the occasional indecency of language, they might be subjected to when taking trial testimony. The reason for women's success as stenographers was ‚Äúobvious,‚Äù the author concluded. ‚ÄúSo long as the woman continues to work at a lower price than is paid to the man for a similar service, the man cannot compete with the woman on what may be assumed to be the woman's ground.‚Äù He thus warned boys ‚Äúto pause and reflect, and then to pause again, and to continue to reflect, for several days or weeks, before entering a profession which has comparatively few prizes to offer, and has very little substantial reward even for those who draw a prize.‚Äù The women, it seemed, had devalued what once had been a man's noble calling.‚Äù I hope the above provides a good example of how ""women's work"" has been devalued historically and why I, as a medical transcriptionist for 15 years with a 40-year work history in the field of ""just secretarial"" work, am presently paid the same wages as a garbage truck driver would make at the start of his career. If it was up to choice, why would I not have chosen to be a garbage truck driver? Could it possibly be because of the strength requirements, i.e., a male's natural aptitude?",1,0
"This video misses the point! Ok men DO work in jobs that pay more and sometimes this is due to danger or time worked, BUT it doesn't explain WHY a skilled but feminised profession like nursing (which is both skilled and difficult) pays fast food wages! Looking at the caring professions in general (even skilled and important ones such as day care, social work and nursing), professions which women gravitate to and..... by coincidence they all PAY low??? The argument that businesses would employ women if it were true??? WTF try and find 80 women oil rig workers.....or plumbers.....or engineers STOOOPID argument but industry happily DOES underpay in the professions that women prefer? Too complex to work out the reason? Nah!!! In the past when women started working and moved into these fields MEN payed the wages and undervalued their work. The present situation is a result of the past. So we can say that the reason for this difference is complex (which it probably is) or acknowledge that it IS UNFAIR (regardless of how complex the reason for the present factual situation is) and rather than forcing women to move into jobs they might not care for PAY them fairly where they predominantly can be found!!! Lastly I'm a guy....I don't believe in the premise that this is all down to toxic masculinity but I'm also not going to deny what is right in front of me! My sister is skilled and works with brain damaged adults getting payed 27 dollars an hour.....I work as a night attendant at a university (opening and closing doors, requiring no skill or care)....I get 38 dollars.....happy I don't care.....and thus get payed a living wage!",1,0

"You can use similar ""conflating variables"" to explain away the racial pay gap.

Unconscious biases, which affect hiring & promotion & evaluation, remain things that show up in serious studies time and time again, in spite of claims ""based mom"" make here. Toxicity in too many education and professional environments often leave only the women who are willing to ""tough it out,"" often at great costs to their minds and hearts, as the Weinstein revelations show. And on the based mom thing: Why, PragerU, long after the revelations that have come out about fellow gator hero Milo, after the gator conspiracies and hand-waving excuses have been exposed for what they are, are you continuing to be affiliate with and promote in your ads anyone even remotely associated with that alt-riech terrorist campaign masquerading as citizen-journalism, nevermind ""Based Mom"" of all people? She thinks mentally ill kids should just tough out harassment and physical abuse in public schools. We see the fruit of such policies on that which is swept under the rug as ""bullying.""

I asked her what specific jobs she meant then and she said ‚Äúthe jobs they do studies on‚Äù. That drove me nuts. You can't just read a study and not even look at where they got the information. Like seriously, what do people think happen? That women just get handed a 77 cent check at subway after their shift and men get handed a dollar. You can't pay people differently just based on their gender. Anyways, I should show her this video.",1,0

"If men truly did make 23% more than women then that would be a truly raw deal for men. 1. Men die on the job 13 times more than women. 2. Men are 20 times more likely to work two jobs and work over time. 3. Men have a much much higher injury rate and burn out rate. 4. Men have less perks. a lot of companies don't have paternity leave. 5. Men by far work more dangerous jobs and more remote jobs. 6. Men see their families far less. 7. Men are the vast majority of combat deaths. And for all that men ONLY get 23% more? Its should be 2 or 3 times more. Now if the gov forces salaries to be equal then its clearly men who get screwed. Yes when we hear 10 women and 10 men died in a coal mine accident THEN talk about equality. Until then, men are screwed.",1,0

"I've operated, consulted for and owned various businesses. Like most entrepreneurs, administrators, consultants and executive, my focus was; hiring persons who were smarter than I was (less for me to do) and maximizing profits. If I could have hired women and paid them less than men for the same job, I would NEVER have hired men. The fact that men have these ‚Äòoverpaid' jobs and are even hired is contrary to any bottom-line consideration. And that is the big lie in all this.",1,0
who would expect a conservative group to consider every fact? Right! Me neither. All the arguments that try to explain why there isn't any wage gap miss out one thing. Of course you know that but you constantly manage to ignore it. Women have to give birth and therefore: 1. need a stable environment 2. can't just be available 24/7 3. can't just move around the world as firms want them to I consider a loving father to say the same things but as workers need to get more flexible because the companies are outsourcing their risk to the employees men have to addict to such injustices The real problem is the worker unfriendly workplace,1,0
"I have been tortured for 30 years by the same old tired arguments of gender pay differences.

Nonetheless, in summary, I encountered example after example, company after company, where in general females were paid more than males. Go figure.",1,0

Did you make this video to test the conservative point of view? I've been in the work force for 30 years and yes there's a gender wage gap. To use an argument such as men are willing to be on call at all times etc is why they're paid more is not valid. Women who work the same long hours and are available at all hours get paid less period. Companies wouldn't hire just women to save the 25% because they still believe men can do a better job even if it costs more.,1,0

"I mostly agree with this video, although I think there are some things one still has to consider. As you mentioned there still is a wage gap between men and women for the same work, which you explained as being the cause of men being more willing to do long hours. But why is that? Biological differences between men and women aren't that big, so that they would allow us to say that the reason is biological. No, it's the way how men and women are raised differently in our society. That's also the reason why most women work in lower paid jobs as you mentioned at the beginning, because we raise them to work in these jobs. That's the core of the whole gender wage gap discussion.",1,0
"No, that's not how it works. These are all reliable facts, but these have all been already considered. It's still true, that women often earn less for the exact *same* work over the exact same time.

There's a wage gap (as tiny as you want it to be), and there's a clear difference in how jobs are distributed. There's also a ""habit"" from males to work longer hours or night shifts, while women won't. These are all correlations telling you something, you can't deny their existence. And that's why we are all saying there's sexism involved. The reason behind sexism? Well, we have to figure it out. That's science. Awful video. Really.",1,0

"You know I am not a fan of what every single thing feminist say, but there is a wag gap. It is a fact that the wage gap exist. It just is a FACT. The wage gap, and if you talk to people who understand the wage gap they will tell you this, takes into consideration or account different choices men and women make, such as job position, total hours worked, also number of children, and the frequency at which unpaid leave is taken, in addition to other factors. They do take into account the type of degree one receives in college. Every feminist knows this. But what feminist also bring up, that people hate hearing, which is a real factor that exist, is discrimination, which accounts for 40% of the wage gap. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) the U.S. has the 12th largest gender pay gap overall, and the gap in this country is bigger than the gap in most European countries. The Economic Policy Institute says ""In simple terms, no matter how you measure it, there is a gap."" Also the reason women make the choices they do, get the college degrees they do, could be the result of a sexist culture, maybe, not saying that is the case.",1,0

"i personally think that a good portion of the actual wage gap comes from men being more aggressive when it comes to requesting raises and are willing to over compensate when wanting the raise. my wife for one was fine with just being a crew member. i encouraged her to work harder and show her employers that she is worth more than what they are paying her. within 6 months, she was offered shift lead, and i continued to boost her confidence and pushed her to stay on top of things, giving her advice on how to prove herself. she pushed and worked harder, she out shined most of her co workers. with in a year, she was made management. i helped her develop the tools needed to excel and succeed in the job she liked. i encourage her and stand behind her whenever she feels that she isn't doing good enough and help her reach the stars because she means so much to me and i can see that her success makes her happy. she never would have accomplished so much with out a man's outlook to guide her. not saying she would have eventually gotten the position on her own, but she would have taken much much longer the way she was handling it. she is strong without me, but she is even stronger with me. we are partners and she outshines me now, and i am so proud of her.",1,0

"...I guess what makes people get negative the most is also the fact that she monetized all those videos including this last one today. First one has two ads (2mil views, aka at LEAST 5-10k) second one has three ads (1mil views, aka around 3-5k) and this last one has FOUR ads (which will no doubt reach a million views at least, so all in all with those last three vids that's anywhere from 10k at the MINIMUM to 30k+, all this in three days). That's why people, amongst other things but mainly I feel, took it as ""oh just another clickbait troll stunt from Trisha the chicken nugget"". She is who she is, and usually id tell her she doesn't need to explain anything but this time it def got icky somehow and she HAS to take serious action to rectify the damage she's done. I think she should be demonetizing those videos OR BETTER donating ALL the money from them to the LGBTQ+ community, with proof. Despite all, I truly believe she cares about this community and that she didn't intend anything bad....the only thing that could make me question that is her keeping that money üí∞ I think she is just a very dependant person who absorbs the personality of whoever is in her life at that time and who then has an identity crisis when that person gets out of her life. It's not necessarily a bad thing (she could DEF turn this around be an award winning actress with what is originally a more negative personality traits lol), but the girl needs to go away for a while, alone, on a vacation, and concentrate on finding herself once and for all.

totally agree with you blaire. I am very fluid and indecisive about my gender expression. As a kid one minute id be rolling around in mud playing with toy trucks and army soldiers the next id be covering myself in my mums makeup and doing fashion shows with my girlfriends. (at 19 not much has changed lmao) these things dont make my gender any different ive just been raised in s household where it was encouraged to express yourself as long as it was safe and appropriate. BUT I am 100% comfortable with the fact that i have boobs and a vagina. I am a woman and a proud one. im very assertive and dominant in situations BUT I FULLY IDENTIFY WITH BEING A WOMAN! ive had some of my leftist friends try to say that im trans or genderfluid who couldn't accept the fact that i am a woman. these are the same people that advocate for womans rights and preach that you can be masculine and androgynous and still be a woman and yet also preach sexist stereotypes to indicate that you are one gender or the other like bitch?!?!?! im so confused???,2,0

I'm a girl, I love Blaire but that still doesn't make me trans.

"So, she's clearly nuts and is extraordinarily unbalanced, mentally - with all of these little admissions of her's, that much is obvious. Looks like a woman, acts like some women, thinks like some women... clearly a woman - and she even knows she was born female, has female biology and everything, outward indicates an identification with this... but thinks she transsexual but also, or has in the past, thinks she's... you know what, it doesn't even matter. You get a person saying certain things out loud and they just lose all credibility - the chances of a person coming back from that and ever, mentally, being capable of handling more or being more are slim-to-none. She's not ever going to get more intelligent, she was an idiot then and is still, clearly, an idiot now. This is the problem with insular thinking, particularly when you're not even remotely intelligent or capable of honest self-analysis or self-awareness - you think stupid things for terrible or non-reasons and then you start to believe them, because this stuff never came out of your mouth in the presence of intelligent, honest, critical people (if it ever did at all) - Trisha was never set straight and had it explained to her why she is wrong and will likely never be right for the rest of her existence. Best case scenario, she's a troll that thinks this is somehow a good idea and that just makes her an asshole and an idiot - worst case scenario, she actually thinks this way and she's many neurons short a coherent thought and she's a different kind of idiot. Why are the available options *never* good? All that saved me in this video was Blaire - Blaire and that adorable nose-scratch she did.",5,1

"Gigi's video was... well. Hmm. Confusing. Because her end conclusion was how we have to accept Trisha's assertion and therefore fight against ignorance while she ignored every ignorant thing Trisha said, like how Trisha identified as trans because she wanted male privilege while still identifying with her birth gender. That seems like the kind of ignorance (hypocrisy?) that Gigi might want to poke at. Just a bit.",2,0

"Men shop themselves around more often, especially early in their career. Women are far more likely to stay i their first job for longer. While men are more likely to check the Help Wanted sections, or hire a headhunter to try to find a higher paying job, Men are also more likely to ASK for bigger raises at the end of the year. (The company isn't going to just give you a big raise every year if you don't ask.) When you compare men and women with similar EVERYTHING...similar education, similar years experience AND a similar philosophy on work (either both men and women who shop themselves around and change jobs frequently, or both men and women who are content with their first job) then the wage gap disappears entirely. In fact, then, women get a few cents more.",2,0

"Ah, my daily dose of logic and reasoning for the day. : )",2,0
"Uhh, No, the facts you showed actually revealed that the male dominance of the high paying jobs, which happens because the society and our culture encourage boys about having such job a lot more than girls, creating the wage gap.(no, it's not because boys are better at STEM. The science itself already proved that girls are just as good as boys at math and science and etc.) Also, since our businesses were run by mostly males since the beginning of the word business, the culture actually IS more fit to men. Which also is the big reason of the wage gap. Women are discriminated, just look at the facts",1,0

"I disagree. I know a true, real life example of a wage gap. I know a professor who got a job in a southern college and was paid less than her husband who was hired a year later. He has less education and less experience than she does and yet she was told that he earns more because he is head of the home and that they both receive the money, so why does it matter how each of them get paid? They quit and got a job at a college in the north instead. She now gets paid more since she works harder than her husband and has more education and experience.",1,0

"*Title: There Is No Gender Wage Gap* Goes on to talk about how there is in fact a gender wage gap, but don't worry, if you make good choices then you can shrink it all the way down to a 6.6 cent difference. Which essentially means that, even if you play your cards right, you will be paid 6.6 percent less if you're a woman than if you're a man. Also want to point out how this lady goes and talks in a video about how bad boys are doing in school and getting worse grades than girls, mainly because they spend too much time outside, and therefore we need to change the system so that it can benefit them. Basically, when it comes to girls, it's their job to adjust their choices to adapt to a system clearly built against them. But when it comes to boys, it's the opposite, since even though their poor performance in school is solely due to their own decisions, we must change the system to benefit them. Yeah, these guys basically just tell right-wing people what they want to hear. Friendly reminder that Prager U is predominately funded by an oil tycoon and then comes out with a video called ‚ÄúWhy You Should Love Fossil Fuels.‚Äù",2,0

"This intro is kind of dumb. The reason businesses don't only hire women is because 1). the women will know that they are being paid less than if a man worked there and that's incredibly disrespectful. 2) if a business hired only women, men would be absolutely pissed and boycott all of the businesses and they would lose money. before watching the whole video I believed in the wage gap, now that i have other statistics, i dont! Other than the fact that the information is dated, its a good video!",2,0
2000 butthurt feminists who deny facts disliked this video,2,0
I wondered how they calculated the wage gap but if they do it that way it's not proving except that men earn more on average. Feel like showing this to my form tutor who always goes on bashing about men and how we're the bain of all evil,2,0
The thing I dislike about these videos is the fact they name a source (such as the US Department of Labor studies and use it to prove choice is to blame) and don't link it anywhere in their videos.,1,0
"But isn't that the point of the wage gap? To show that there is an OVERALL difference in compensation. Yes, of course that is not because some evil managers want to pay less money, but because of personal choices which are a direct product of influences from our society. There is a wage gap, though it is not a matter of paying more or less but of a social issue that makes woman and men tend to different carreer choices. I guess some people manipulate everything, it's just a shamr because the concept behind it is nice and would help both woman and men.",2,0

"'Counselling and psychology' welp, looks like I'll have to find a new career then :/ it's what I've stuck to for years now but since it's one of the least paying jobs, I'll probably have to do something I won't enjoy to be able to afford things. I wish my high school told me sooner because now I have to start all over again",1,0
"As usual feminist want equality without responsibilities and want to earn more without working or less work. These days feminist don't even understand that man put more efforts to earn more, man doesn't sit in comfort zone, he take risk, he takes more pressure, sit long hours in work.",3,0
So many angry woman screaming at their screens right now.,3,0
"I thought about this for a min, in particular the first question. Especially bc this logic would then apply to other wage-gaps: whether it ethnicity, disabilities, age, and even something as small as employee physical appearance. Tall, attractive people are statistically paid more, so why not hire only short ugly people? The reason is, people inherently believe that the short, ugly, female, etc. person is worse at their jobs and deserves less pay. Or, much more often, they believe that the tall, attractive, white, male will do a better job and therefore deserves more. Basically, favouritism. So, to put it another way, the first question implies that the hiring manager *knows* that a man and woman will perform the same task to the same ability. But in reality, prejudices impact how they perceive someone completing a task; so the hiring manager will *believe* a white man will and does perform the job better and deserve more compensation.",2,0

"I'm confused. Doesn't this help prove that there is a gender wage gap precisely because men are in the high paying fields such as engineering and computer science while women are in more low paying fields such as education and social work? Yes, it is each individuals choice to be in those fields, but only because our society encourages them to go into those fields and still sets women up as the carers and teachers, while setting men up as the brainiacs and scientists or athletes. Most of us don't do this on purpose, but we all do it indirectly by supporting gender traditions like, Barbie vs. Hot Wheels or the wife taking the last name of the husband. And we have gender traditions for the worforce too. For example, picture an airline pilot and a flight attendant. I always picture the pilot to be male and the flight attendant to be female. Same for me goes with chef/server, doctor/nurse, manager/receptionist. I always thought this is what was meant by the gender wage gap, (which this video proved to be true) not that companies are so sexist they literally pay men more than women. To say that so many women choose these caretaker jobs over men and that so many men choose these intellectual jobs over women is all based on each individuals choice seems to be ignoring our gender defining culture. Right now we are still a fairly sexist society. Wouldn't that affect everything? Especially the workforce?",2,0

"This video is misinformed and misconstrues a Georgetown study titled, ""Women Can't Win Despite Making Educational Gains and Pursuing High-Wage Majors, Women Still Earn Less than Men"" to manipulate its audience. One main finding of the study is, ""Discrimination. Even when women do everything ‚Äúright‚Äù‚Äîchoose a high-paying field of study, pursue a high-paying major within that field, and get a job in a high-paying occupation‚Äîwomen still get paid less than their male peers. If a man and woman who are equally qualified get the same job, the woman still only earns 92 cents for every dollar the man is paid‚Äîmore than 81cents, to be sure, but a far cry from earnings equality."" To not include this principal finding of the 68 page study is disrespectful to the truth of the gender wage gap, which might not be that every woman earns 77 cents to every 1 dollar a man earns, but it still exists at a 8 cent deficit according to the sited Georgetown study. Shame to PragerU for disrespecting the truth and mission of this study, spreading factually incorrect data with conviction, and manipulating its millions of viewers.",1,0
"Sorry, but I have to point out a mathematical error in this video.

"The gender wage gap is foolish, you get paid for what you do. Just because you are a female doesn't mean you can do easy jobs and expect a high wage.

"When evidence contradicts your theory ‚Äì your theory is wrong. As the video acknowledges ‚Äì THERE IS A PAY GAP. An Australian study of OVER 1,000 occupations showed that ‚ÄúWomen earn more than men in only one high-paying job in Australia‚Äù and that women only out earned men in jobs that were low paid anyway (data from Australian Tax Office). As the Australian study found ‚Äì ‚Äúthere is no such thing as a job where women are taking home large pay packets but men are not‚Äù. The median income for jobs favouring men was up to ELEVEN TIMES higher than the median income for jobs favouring women, And it does make a fundamentally flawed assumption - that ""Corporations"" do the hiring. They dont -individual managers make hiring decisions - and rarely are their incentives aligned with corporate objectives. A corporation may claim ""equality"" but individual managers have to handle staff absences when women are off having children - consciously and sub consciously there is an incentive to hire and promote men ‚Äì and thus pay women less to discourage them from accepting a role. The final flawed logic is that ‚Äúwe cant explain why there is a discrepancy, therefore we cant claim that there is one‚Äù. The claim was that women were paid less ‚Äì and the data shows that this is true ‚Äì whether or not one can explain the reason; if police used that logic they would never investigate murders because ‚Äúthey cant explain how it happened therefore they cant be certain that it did happen",1,0

"As we are talking about common sense. Let's really use it. About occupations and choices I have little to say. Of course it is about choice, about a choice that is influenced by more than one varible, by education (which women had no opportunity to receive years ago, and which in under-developed countries still don't receive) and by society and stereotypes. But acknowledging what you say and leaving this issue aside let me use common sense to answer the question you stated at the beggining. Why won't bussinesses hire all women? Simple answer: what we call in Spain ""El techo de cristal"". Women just for the condition of being women are underrated, just because of the fact that they may have a baby are under appreciated to the point where businesses won't hire them because they will have to leave due to their maternity. And I am talking worldwide. So please let's stop being a society that can see but is not looking, let's stop ignoring the undeniable reality.

And as the video clearly states, this gap exist more due to the career choices men and women make, than an evil men conspiracy. There will always be a gender gap, and sometimes it will swing in one way, and sometimes another. Because we are all individuals. Are women stupid for choosing a career they enjoy?

So the case is that the entire concept of a gender wage-gap was established from a misinterpretation of a statistic regaring average salary of men and women?

"This is a very misleading video and clearly has a lot of the people in the comments confused. First off the title of this video is clearly wrong. Within the video it states that there is a wage gap but that it is produced by choice. From this position you must then ask why women are ""choosing"" lower paid jobs? There are multiple answers to this. Firstly the patriarchal society in which we live has tended to pay male dominated industries more. This is not necessarily because these industries are of more value, it is due to unions and wage debates over decades. Secondly women are told from a young age that they will be a nurse, teacher or any other female dominated industry. This is through all kinds of life. Also the idea that women should be the ones looking after a child are outdated. This is a joint task for both parents.",1,0

"Despite the actually narrow wage gap between men and women in western industrial societies, there is still a tendency of women to call on traditional female privileges (where in marriage the male was the sole breadwinner) when they say to their spouses, ""What's mine is mine, and what's yours is ours."" It makes a man want to go MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way). I could make an exception, as Christina Hoff Sommers would make an interesting date.",2,0

"She didn't talk about the reason why women go into lesser paying jobs. Why do women choose these less paying jobs? Why don't more women choose higher paying jobs? Women want to work regular hours because they are usually caring for children...they have families. It's not that they ‚Äúneed to get to work‚Äù. Though I am compelled by the no wage gap argument, there is still a stigma, though less prominent than it has been, about where a woman should be placed in society.",1,0
Real good video. I almost thought Ben Shapiro wrote the script,3,0
"Okay, so you normalize for job title and years of experience. But that's the problem. Men are much more likely to have roles in Management and high paying job titles, than women. Women are burdened with having to take care of children AND work a full-time job at the same time, while the majority of men can just focus solely on their career and be home just in time for dinner to be ready while not contributing much else to the household. And I could bet you that my male coworker who has worked there less than I have gets paid more just because he has a ""Masters degree"" next to his name and because he's a male, even though I have much more work experience in total than he does. Because our Indian boss comes from a culture where there is a huge bias of gender and education title.",2,0

"In my job as an executive director of a non-profit, we pay men and women equally, but women end up making less because they take more time off, exceeding what we allow, which means they aren't paid for it. A couple women scream 'equal pay for equal work' but I remind them that also means 'equal work for equal pay'. If they aren't there to work, they won't get paid for it. Unfortunately, for women, women take time off not only when they are sick, but also when family members are sick, or when someone in the family has a school consultation or school play or Dr's or Dentist's appointment. One woman in the office would leave every day at 4:00pm, an hour before everyone else because the bus would drop her kids off at school at that time. When she complained about me docking her pay for that, I explained that why would it be fair for me to pay her that hour when the others in the office were actually working to be paid. (I had suggested that she not take a lunch or come in early, but those didn't work for her either. I felt like she was lucky I let her go home early every day; she felt like I was robbing her.",2,0

"If after factoring in choice the wage-gap shrinks to only 6.6 cents for every dollar, that means that choice isn't responsible for a small wage-gap. The 6.6 cents/ dollar is the result after accounting for choice. This means that women are paid less on average. Some women are likely paid significantly less than male peers working the same jobs while in other companies women are on par with their coworkers. Yes, a large component of the lager wage gap- 77 cents for every dollar is due to job choice, however it does not fully account for the wage gap. And 94 cents to every dollar is still a significant gap.",2,0

"Lady. You forgot to mention how women still lag behind their male coworkers by 7%, rather than 22%, after controlling for age, education, and years of experience, and there's a 27% difference in total pay between men and women. Also, When you separate income data by occupation, the gender wage gap becomes even clearer. The biggest gender wage gaps, due to occupational segregation, are seen in jobs located in business, finance, law, and health-care occupations that are primarily self employed, such as chiropractors. The smallest wage gaps are seen in technology and science industries, and health-care positions with a small degree of self-employment, like pharmacists.",2,0

It's a choice. That men and women both make. On call = missing out on a lot in life Dangerous work environment = high risk of death or serious injury Work long and late hours = sacrificing time with loved ones and personal time for yourself. No disrespect to women but 95% of them are not willing to do any of that but will complain their not getting paid as much as the person who is. Men don't do it because it's fun we do it because someone has to. If you was a employer and had a employee working late hours on a short notice. Willing to be on call. Willing to come in on their days off. Willing to relocate and go out on dangerous work environments. Wouldn't you want to pay them a bit more then the person who isn't willing to do any of that?,3,0

"They do not hire only women for the same reason they pay women less than men. Sexism and prejudice. They think that even with paying less for a female employee it would not be worth it.

"0:04 - 0:22 Sexism, maybe? 0:32 - 1:19 Alright 1:19 - 1:27 so there's some bias right there. You made the bar say ""77 cents"" when it should have said ""23"" cents. Or, you could have made the bar say 77 cents, and then say ""93.4 cents"". I'm willing to forgive it, but bias is something one shouldn't forget about. 1:27 - 1:39 That's one way to interpret it. There is the idea that certain jobs are paid less because they are traditionally female, and because women tend to gravitate towards them. 1:54 - MAY BE. That's the key term in that sentence. 2:00 - 3:09 See, this is where the interesting part is. Do those jobs pay less because they're traditionally female? The one job where women dominate men (the second highest paying one, I mean) is still TRADITIONALLY considered a male dominated job. Perhaps the pay for these jobs is low becuse they're traditionally female. 4:03 Okay, so men are overrepresented in dangerous jobs. But women are overrepresented in jobs which help the social classes, and keep the country turning and people in need happy. Men are overrepresented in business jobs, which pay too much, and contribute little enough to society that if a few went out of business, it wouldn't really effect most people in a major way. Women should be paid more for jobs like pshychology, education, human services and social work, which is essential to our society.",2,0

Whenever she talks about the wage gap topic, she brings up the fact that her mom, who was a doctor, was payed less than other doctors in the same field (I don't remember what kind of doctor she was). I just couldn't agree with her with this example as her evidence. I knew for a fact that there were way to many factors that went into an individuals pay for the reasoning to just be, ""women aren't being treated equally"". Im sure there are other true examples of inequality but they must be very rare and small cases that are also probably resolved quickly. I don't see why people have to assume all the statistics correlate or have anything to do with each other. They just show what's happening, not how its happening.",2,0

Well right but the problem is her boss! , from 2k she is getting payed a lot less than she should (about 1200‚Ç¨) she is scared do ask her boss the reason that she gets a low payment because is a little bit hard to find a job in that City, i dont know if her boss is sexist or an asshole or even both but that is a huge wage gap and indeed is happening in some reare cases.(i dont disagree with the video i just want to say that this happens some times and i got as a explaination my friends mother that is based on a reall story oh and sorry for my english )",2,0

I know we love this idea of the Mary Sue characters like Ray from star wars... No practice, no effort, just instantly a master of whatever she tries to do. That's not real life. Unfortunately the person that tries the hardest usually wins. Men care more about making money, so they try harder to make money. Because they try harder, guess what?

"There is still a gender wage gap. The video is very good. The conclusion misses something however. The ""best-paying"" specialties often require flexible hours, in business for instance a high paying career is one that requires you to have a lot of meetings outside of your 9-5 routine. Given that women tend have more commitments at home than men, they are not as free to shape their lives around their work like men. So are there less women in high-paying jobs? Because they consciously dislike high-paying jobs and prefer lower-paying jobs? No. Because we expect women to take care of the kids. To make dinner. To wash the clothes. To take care of the house. As a result, men are more flexible than women. As a result, you wouldn't hire someone who can't be as commited. And if you are expected to not be as commited, you won't even consider these jobs. This explains why in science and research careers for instance, which don't require as much commitment outside of 9-5 hours, women do just as well as men. Is it fair? It's a different debate. In my opinion, yes, it is. See ya",2,0

This is disgusting as a female track runner I'm so upset you can't deny the FACTS THAT YOU ARE A MAN! We will support your change of sex but it doesn't change the FACT that you trans are physically stronger,5,1
"The other side of it is this. In Texas, a young transman was forced to compete as birthsex female. This person was hormonally transitioned into a male, and it's stupid and dishonest to say hormone therapy doesn't change your sex characteristics. Everything will change. What you ended up with was the image of a young man with a young girl in a chokehold. This young man had begged to compete against men, and was not allowed. They made him wrestle girls. You can LOOK at it and see it's wrong. This is also very clearly wrong. Neither side has this right.

That is a man, still a man,no matter the surgeries and should not be able to compete against women. Men have testosterone, women have estrogen! This type of stuff makes me mad. It is not fair. Men were made to protect women no matter how people try to swing it they can get the f*** over that s*** it's disgusting!

As soon as that happened he came out with this wannabe woman s***! Still has no sex change and got woman of the year that is disrespectful at its finest! There is definitely something wrong with men and this world!",7,1
How do they have an advantage They're running,1,0
"People keep wanting to put feelings first. Yes, I understand you're a transgender girl and that's your gender identity, but you must understand that there is an obvious biological advantage that comes with being biologically born male. Like the woman said in the video, men produce a lot of testosterone which increases the production of red blood cells that absorbs more oxygen, enables men to develop larger skeletal muscles, and develop larger hearts. These give men a larger aerobic advantage. So no, transgender girls who are biologically men, cannot and should not be allowed to compete with cisgender girls because of the obvious unfairness.",5,1

"At first, I found her video hilarious, but then I got a migraine. See, I'm ftm myself, and in the past I've watched Trisha's videos, but only the ones where she hung out with other YouTubers like Shane Dawson, Jeffree Star, etc. That being said, I never thought she was a bad person, just a bit on the dramatic side. Now, when I first viewed her... video, I was like cry-laughing, choking on my drink and shit, but when I really began thinking, and began seeing others getting offended by it, I rewatched it. I can see why everyone's flipping shit. Trisha is literally using the transgender community to stay relevant, because showing her tits on camera as a 37 year old woman is not working for her anymore. That's... that's *bullshit.* I remembered all the shit I had to through just to get to wear boxers or a binder, or cut my hair, etc, and the shit that I still do go through being a Freshman in High School. (Class of 2023 ain't lookin' too Open-minded... yikes) and that got me thinking: *What the fuck?* Like, she's making us look worse. The transgender community is already a hailstorm essentially, but she's really dragging us through the mud. Her ""apology"" video wasn't even an apology. Like most YouTuber apologies, it was just a video of her trying to defend herself and make herself look like the victim. (I suggest you view that next, sis... but bring Asprin) She drags us through the mud, but when we knock her ass down into the puddle she dragged us through, she cries about it? She's almost 40, and I think she needs to get the fuck off the platform really. She's mistaking a midlife crisis for a gender identity dilemma. Luv u, Blaire! You always do such great reactions, and you're hella good at debating people and explaining situations.

"You can be an ally without being trans, trisha. I get it, its hard to know what is the right way to be supportive, but that's why we watch channels like blaire's. Blaire, thank you for educating us and clearing up things that are difficult to understand. I kinda get how Trisha got confused though. Personally, I did go through a phase where I wondered if I might be trans when I was a young teen. But eventually I realized that I just don't like dressing in girly clothes or wearing make up. That doesn't make me a trans man. It just means I like being comfortable. :)",1,0

Like you've dealt with this pain yourself....the hate of your own body, feeling so uncomfortable, the mental toll it takes on you and have experienced what life is like...so wouldn't she be able to see Trisha is trolling..? I personally feel like Gigi is letting down the whole trans community for standing by her. She is her friend and she should explain to her that she is not trans and that what she is doing is hurting people.",2,0
MY opinion: 1. Troll video for views 2. Gender shouldnt be a big deal like using Jonathan van ness - he came out and that's that we shouldnt be shoving things in people's faces -- i am a strong advocate for lgbtq rights and it's sad that blaire thinks non-binarism is a fad :( 3. Trisha is crazy so we shouldnt be really caring too much about her but rather for trans rights 4. 0 gender dysphoria i see 5. She just wants to be masc and fem in her gender EXPRESSION NOT identity,5,1

"Trisha really seems to struggle with her identity. I don't know her or her content that well (only hear about her a little from Emelia Fart and Shane Dawson) but from what I've seen, I'm thinking she might have Histrionic personality disorder - as I can't comment on BPD, seeing as how I don't know how much she fears abandonment. Maybe someone can inform me on that? Trisha definitely shows signs of radical attention seeking behavior and seductive mannerisms. She covers quite a few of the symptoms of a Histrionic. Can't take criticism well (had a breakdown because Ethan from H3H3 goofed a little bit on her), seems to make rash decisions (now she believes she's trans, which isn't something anyone should take that lightly), being overly concerned with physical appearance (even though here she claims she walks around wearing no makeup, but that's moreso when she's alone, which is different), etc. Can't say for sure though since I don't watch her content directly nor do I know her personally. She does generally give me a bad vibe, like I can tell I wouldn't want to meet her in person ever.",3,0

I've some out to people I thought were friends and they said I was faking and I'm not and people have said that I'm faking having anxiety for attention when I actually go to therapy and have real problems. Also the part when you said that celebrities just come out to get more famous. One person I can think of that didn't do that is Brendon Urie from Panic! At the Disco.

"Shes just on the same thought process that leads sjw's to invent another sexuality to describe themselves, and of course not understanding that gender and sexuality are two different things (seriously, it's like none of them get that) is part of that process.

"I kind of understand Trisha. I always was interested in guys that are femine. I was also attracted to this one girl who was really masculine. Basically I am attracted to people that are between genders. (Although I like masculine guys also.) When I was younger I always was gay guy in my erotic dreams, still to this day I sometimes have a dick in my dreams. However I don't think about changing my gender. I'm comfortable enough in my skin to say that since guys usually prefer women I wanna stay female. Additionally if I can't be a handsome guy I rather not be a guy at all. If she have similar issues to me then I think she is overreacting, maybe trying to get the attention. (She succeeded.)

"So a 6.6 cents is acceptable ! The problem with this video is that you don't look deep enough. You explain the differences by: choices of career, carreer evolution and working hour. This is where the sexist issues are. When choosing an orientation, women are told that petroleum, ingeneering, etc is for men and that early education, nursing and such are for women. As for evolution, we see that with equal education, a man will be more and faster promoted than a women. A study gave the same curriculum to companies half with the name John, half with the name Jessica. The companies were willing to pay John 4,000 a year more than Jessica, that is sexism in the enterprise. Finally, women are working less hour because they are still the ones who have to take care of the children, of the house etc. So of course they can't stay as long in the office. Once all these problems have been addressed then we will see equality. Since you like maths, you should know that according to the millions of people we are talking about, the law of large numbers applies aif there was no inequality, the pay difference should be infinitesimal.

90% of statistical data is made up on the spot,1,0
"Oh, it's only 6% less, then I guess it isn't an issue, right? Who cares as long as it isn't a 23% difference. How can you cite a study showing a gender-based pay gap and then say there is no pay gap? How dumb do you think we are? This video completely sidesteps the fact that women feel compelled to enter these traditionally female majors, just as men gravitate towards traditionally male majors. It's kind of unfortunate that women were given lower-paying jobs when they entered the workforce in WW2, because now the roles have solidified into basically the same roles from 70 years ago. Men get higher-paying jobs because they were traditionally the main income earner, and women were either single and living on their own or just earning a little extra pay. I've gone through the data. Did you know that women are more likely to switch majors if they earn a low grade in the introductory classes? C's get degrees, yet for some reason women feel pressure to earn better grades than men on average. PragerU also forgot that maternity leave is expensive, and that it's the most commonly cited reason employers have when they are found to have different pay rates for men and women in the same job. Why would you hire someone who gets a month of paid leave when someone else doesn't? When a woman goes on maternity leave, a new temp must fill in until she is gone, or the firm goes with one less worker for a month. Either way, it's an expense they don't have with male employees.That's why people are arguing for paternity leave so this difference is resolved. PragerU, best cherry-pickers on YouTube. Who needs truth when you can just ignore everything that proves counterpoint to your beliefs?",2,0
This is a woman saying this meaning feminists are people who want money,5,1
"theres a study by the berau of labor statistics that shows in fine enough detail, same job different pay. They do not state anything about employers, but it does highly suggest a wage gap exists. Theory: Higher paying companies tend to hire more men (for whatever reasons), this would create a pay difference not seen anywhere but statistics. Only way I can imagine wage gap existing, and that study really does suggest it does.

"The fact of the matter is that when you look at the big picture, women generally do not want the same job types as men. Far more men go into STEM jobs like engineering, mathematics, science, and technology. Those jobs pay way more. As a result, when you look at the total amount of money earned between men and women, men make more. But when you account for the differences in job types and education, the wage gap vanishes to a much smaller amount (5 cents per dollar - not the 23 cents claimed). To illustrate this point further, white people only make 86 cents for every dollar that an Asian person makes. The reason is not because there is some discrimination going on. It is the exact same reason that men make more than women, as a whole. This is because even more Asians go into STEM jobs than average Caucasians. Wage gaps really have very little to do with discrimination. It just so happens that women, for whatever reason, do not choose to go into higher paying jobs, and do not choose to work as much overtime, etc. And it just so happens that Asians go into high paying jobs even more. That is why whites make 86 cents for every dollar than an Asian makes. And that is why women make 77 cents per dollar that men make. It's just looking at the total amount of money that a group makes. It is not accounting for differences in what types of jobs different groups go into, it does not account for voluntary overtime differences, and it does not take into account educational differences, etc. It's only looking at the total income of men versus women - and this produces a very misleading result.",2,0

"Get ready for it...the next argument about the wage gap that feminists are now using is: males simply won't allow them to enter the higher paying professions. Men are sexist and competitive and therefore scare woman away from the career by hurting their feelings. So now instead of choosing petroleum engineer, women now have to go into a lower paid position like social work. Their arguments never die - they just come up with new stupid ones after their old ones are debunked and die out. I've actually had feminist friends say that girls are purposely intimidated out of math and science careers so that men can solely hold those positions.",3,0

"Whilst I agree that the traditional idea and slogan of 77 cents to a dollar is misleading and fails to take into account all kinds of factors, we can't blame the lack of women in the scientific fields on the idea that men and women make ""different choices"".

"So, women are dumb basically.",5,1
"This gave me a better understanding of the topic. I didn't believe the wage gap made that much of a difference, because it really does depend on the job occupation you chose. It is understandable why a women would get paid less since he jobs women chose are much safer than the jobs that men do. Men are capable of doing much more than women in a physical manner. It is not sexist, its just how people were made. In the video it explained that if you do the math, the wage gap only depends on your occupation and the amount came out to 6.6 cents. Women tend to stick to jobs like counseling, social work, and education. These jobs are considered the worst paying majors. The highest paying majors are careers like engineering and science based, which men have a high percentage employed in these fields. I agree with the videos argument, the wage gap is more of a myth and that it is all based on your career options. Its not to often you see a women working a very laborous and dangerous job. Its a mans job because they are able to put up with certain jobs better than women.",2,0

"As a loan officer at BofA, so during the course of a day I would ask several people how much money the husband and the wife makes. I found in the vast majority of families it is actually the woman with the stable job who makes more money. But when they average in the the high wage earner males into it, it appears that men make more. So for example out of 4 couples 3 would have the wife who makes more money, they fourth the husband may make more than all of other men and women put together. I am guessing that are looking the the numbers in the fourth family the wife is likely to not work at all, so they would count her income as zero. Because her husband makes more money then all of the other people combined they would then say, men make more money. On the other hand I find Liberals lie about statistics and really bend the rules to come up with the result they want to come up with.",3,0
"My mother is a personal trainer. She makes around minimum wage. My father is a plant manager. He pays for just about everything. My mother chose to switch from the factory work my dad stayed in after having my sister. She wanted a more flexible schedule so she could be able to take care of us. She went and got her dream job. Dad is usually on call, can work up to 16 hours on a bad day, and 9 on a good one. He has been at the same place for almost 30 years. If he could he would get an easier lower paying job, but he can't afford to. My fiancee is a mechanic. He makes $22 an hour unlicensed. When he writes his test it could jump to 25 - 30. When we have kids he could be close to $40/hr. I am going into medical office administration, While it can eventually pay in the $20s, I will never earn as much as him unless I end up being promoted or get extra schooling. I am at a disadvantage though, when kids happen, we both want me to be stay at home until the last kid is in school. So that's a lot of years of advancement I lose. THIS IS MY CHOICE. In the end no matter what a woman who wants a family will end up sacrificing more time, even if just to birth and recover. What we need to do is encourage women to try trades, and high academic pursuit. Shared maternity leave, or father maternity leave. Fathers as stay at homes.

The biggest argument for there not being a pay gap is the equal pay act of 1963 which made it illegal to discriminate against women's pay. Every year there is an average of 1000 law suits over the violation of this law roughly 25 percent win. That's 250 people a year can actually prove that they were discriminated against in the workplace. That's mind bogglingly few people.,2,0
"Does anyone have the link to these studies? Contradicts other data I've found so far, so would greatly appreciate.",1,0
"Im sorry. But i think these facts should be examined carefully. 1st. Companies do not only want to reduce costs. They are willing to hire better professionals paying them more. 2nd. Women tend to chose low paying majors not just because of simple individual will, culture, sex roles, family, etc are mediating variables that influences these decisions. Same in men. Men are raised hearing they should be/are good at math and fixing things, also, they are socially rewarded by compliments etc by being good at these fields. No doubt they chose engineering and math as a major. Their toys as kids are astronaut dolls and mechanics. Women toys are babies and nurse barbie. Women are raised as the caring ones, the mommy ones, no doubt they chose social work and early education. It is sexism. People don't make decisions out of nowhere, culture and society are playing a role there. 3rd. We need to examine ""why"" men are willing to be on call in a job. Men have the pressure to be the provider in the family, that's why they are willing to be on call willing to have a better salary. Women don't have these pressure, and the ones who have it, are not the standard. This video has some points, but I think every idea exposed here needs to be discussed in a deeper way.

"Ok, I am 40 yrs old and have always been told I am observer of the human scene and I have witnessed something interesting. These gender wage gap surveys can't be generalized for every and all jobs. I have witnessed half a dozen examples where women actually make more than men in some industries. Doesn't anyone say anything about that? no. because of the modern feminist movement. Fact is that we're human beings and we usually gravitate toward a man or woman when a seeking a service or a product. Need an example? I used to work as a bartender and server, I cleared more tips in a day than my male counterparts cleared in a week. Need something further up the food chain? I disagree with what this lady said about male nurses as I used to work in a hospital and heard the stories about nurses, even with male nurses who would chat with me when days were slow. I have witnessed first hand that female nurses get paid more than their male counterparts, to the point that there male counterparts have to go on welfare because they can make enough to even pay their bills. Even you are a doctor, at times a person will gravitate more toward a woman or a man. Example? women who are gynecologists, dermatologists, acupuncturists, Psychiatrists, Psychologists alternative health professionals get paid more than their male counterparts. How do I know this? I work as medical biller and have done this job for 11 years doing bills for various healthcare professionals. So is there a gender pay gap? no.

"well here's the thing, if my (theoretical) husband and I wanted to start a family, it is more likely that I would be the one taking time off after the baby is born. There is stigma that if a new mother doesn't take the time off for her baby she is considered a ""bad mom"". However, if she does take the time off to care for her new born she is considered ""not hardworking/dedicated"". How is that fair? I agree with what this is saying, that the wage gap is a ""myth"" in the sense that if you do two different jobs with different pay then yes there is a gap. But there are still ideologies that hurt women from going into fields like computer science etc. For example, I have a friend who works with computers and fixes them. However, she is always questioned by customers about if she's doing it right or if that's really the answer. (Even though she is one of the top techs) Meanwhile, a coworker, who is male, who is in a lower position is hardly questioned by customers about what he's doing. So yeah the wage gap may not exist but there is still a stigma that prevents women from entering these fields or stigmas that give them a hard time in the fields.",2,0

"WHY IS THERE A WAGE GAP AT ALL. simple, women make decisions that man cannot do. Women get pregnant, Men don't, so they can continue to work unimpeded for the next 9 months. Even if they don't get pregnant women overall have more health concerns that take them away from work. And another reason men make more is because various jobs often tend to use money to incentivize people to take them. It's why men dominate the careers that tend to expose oneself to unsanitary, filthy, disgusting conditions. The most dangerous jobs in the nation are overwhelmingly male.",3,0

The problem with wage gap is that women have lower hourly wage than men. This can of course change if you're manager and negotiate about your potential income.

One of the most ignorant videos I've come across. This argument is incomplete and the explanation is fragmented... this video tries to propagate the lie that gender wage gap is due to individual choice. Let's take responsibility for the sexism that discourages occupational mobility. Do women choose to have lower paying jobs? Recognize that opportunities for men and women are not equal which is reflected in the wage gap. Women are limited in the kind of jobs they can access because of access barriers in both education and employment. Tests are designed to be more difficult for women than men. Attitudinal barriers about gender roles prevent job mobility. This video conveniently doesn't address systemic problems of oppression that affect the opportunities available to women.,2,0

Men are seen as expendable workers who MUST respect and provide for women, and women are seen as holy princesses who have to live their lives comfortably. This is also why men aren't allowed to hit women, because women are ""the men's superiors and must be treated with respect and care."" It's also why women have their feelings coddled and cared for, when men are expected to never show their emotions. Women deserve to have their feelings cared for because they're not expendable, and no one gives a shit about mens emotions because they ARE expendable.",3,0

"2 glaring issues, one mathmatical and the other conceptual Begining with the marh, You're using the word ""median"" and ""average"" interchangeably, Wich skews your conclusion, as they are not the same thing. To show this differences, I'll use simple numbers, if you have a data set (a set of numbers representing value, the numbers in this example are chosen to display the difference between between average and median) that contains these 15 numbers : [1,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,7,26] to find the AVERAGE of these numbers, you find the sum (1+3+3+4+4+5+5+5+5+5+5+6+6+7+23) and devide it by the amount of numbers (90\15=6) this average however, does not account for the massive outlier (a number far removed from the main grouping in the data set) Wich skews the data higher. If you wanted the MEDIAN of this data set, you count inward from both sides to find the middle number, with 15, the number with 7 numbers on each side of it, Wich is , in this case, 5. Though that difference seems Small, 5 and 6 are pretty close, the numbers we used in this example are small, and when you start comparing data sets, and bring percentages into it, the difference becomes bigger, imagine we have a different data set, let's call it set B, (and call our original set a) and set B has an average of 6 AND a median of 6. If we compare the averages, we get a 0% different, because 6/6=1, they are the same number however, if you compare median, you get a 17% different, as 6/5=.83 and 1-.83=.17. that difference is small with are numbers, but when you have larger data sets, like data on wages, that percentage makes a difference, and that difference between average and median can skew your conclusion, Wich is why all the citations of information in this video are incorrect, because you're using studies that compare medians, and studies that compare averages together and interchangeably, and therefore reaching a, not entirely incorrect, but nevertheless fallacious conclusion. Now, issue 2, a bit shorter. You cite that 4/5 too paying jobs are primarily male, and 4/5 lowest are mostly female, and when accounting for this, you get a very small wage gap, however the comparison of the TOTAL averages yields a larger gapThis inherently means that more women work in lower paying jobs, Wich speaks to a larger sexism issue, not with individual employers, or even individual industries, (as you've shown the gaps with industry accounted for is small) but CAN (can, meaning might) indicate a larger issue, that because if societal expectations, women mostly go into certain fields, fields that pay less than mostly male dominated Fields.

"I am a feminist. I agree with everything in this video. WHICH IS WHY, if we want to see women on average earning the same as men on average (referring to the opening statistic she cited) then we need to encourage women to enter certain fields (the top 5 paying majors). What this video did NOT comment on were the REASONS women are choosing not entering these fields. If the TRUE COSTS of a certain career are higher for women than for men, then of course we will see unequal gender representation in said field. By TRUE COSTS I am referring to the emotional costs of being the lone women, or the of facing constant rude comments can take on a person. Society has a long history of gender roles and it has been a very difficult process for people to breakdown these notions of ""women's work"" versus ""a man's work."" For example, if women who want to become petroleum engineers not only have to obtain all the same degrees and experience as their male counterparts, BUT ALSO have to overcome social and emotional obstacles (which men face to a much lesser degree because this field is already seen as a natural fit for men) then OF COURSE women are not choosing to enter those fields because they wage they would earn does not cover all the costs associated with that career. Thus, they way to close the gap between average female and average male earnings is to make adjustments at a societal level on how we work and interact with one another - attempting to make each professional field an equally valid option for both genders. Lastly, in references to the idea that there is better pay for employees willing to work longer hours or keep more flexible hours. The current trend of women choosing jobs or positions with more traditional working hours can be attributed to the fact that women STILL take on the majority of housework and child rearing responsibilities - so of course they cannot accept positions with irregular or extended hours. Thus, if we want to see women changing the sort of hours they work (and thus the level of pay they receive) then we need to give men paternity leave, and try to equally distribute the burdens or parenthood between the two parents (assuming you are lucky enough to have two parents).",1,0

"I actually have a personal story that could shed some light on the unexplained wage gap after calculations. My mother was the gm of an advertising company and she had many agents working under, but two stood out, they both worked the same amount of hours and overtime, they both had the same quality of work and had similar qualifications and contracts, and one was a man, the other a woman and they had both been working around a year and a half. One day the woman discovered that the man mad about 4 percent more than her, though they had the same position and bonuses. When she came to my mother and asked about it, she learned it wasn't because of sexism, it was very simple, the man asked for a raise and got it. My mother admitted to the woman that if she had asked for a raise, she would have gotten one, but because she didn't, the guy made more than her on his base salary. This is very common in certain fields because men on average have more confidence in the workplace, as such they have around a 4-5x more likelihood of asking for a raise or bonus. The woman asked for it and she got it, and when my mother was later promoted to senior vp of marketing, the man got a promotion to gm, why you may ask? Because he asked for the promotion first, and my mother gave it to him as he was a member of the top 2 agents along with the woman. The morale of the story is that this smaller wage gap can be explained IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS, by workplace confidence. It is your job to ask for a raise or promotion, and not the employer to ask if you want one, because confidence and decisiveness in the workplace can trump credentials almost 90% of the time. I hope you can all learn from the woman's mistake and use it forward in your career.",2,0

The earnings gap is one of the most hilarious public policy discussions of today because: 1. I don't think the government should force women to go into fields solely because they pay more. 2.

I don't think the government should force women to make specific decisions in which job to take / which salary to accept. 4.

If every time you fail doing something someones tells you not to try again, or that you can't do that, you are not going to even try making personal choices that involve being surrounded by men that probably are going to feel better than you (and are going to make you feel like you're worse than them).

Strong independent women never stop educating themselves, overcoming bad times, working hard, being responsible and fair with men. Strong women do not fall into feminists' fallacies... there is NOT such a gender wage gap! Strong women respect men and women alike because independent women look far beyond the genre.

"Good video but I have the feeling it is important to contrast some points. 1) Until recently, women didn't have the same access to the education or leading position as men. Actually, only one think remained from that period: the idea that women are in charge of the children more than men. This way of thinking creates a lot of problem because entering in trouble with going up the career ladders for women. As a woman, you are really more likely to be less available for your job than men. 2) Again, because men have been used to occupate leader positions, men are still now doing more studies related to this. Women on the contrary will do study according to the image built given to her linked to their housing task: listen, take care and so on... Explaining why they are more often following those studies. To conclude, I would say that facts presented in that video are true, but I think we still need to change the way we see women in the society.

"I enjoyed the video and I'm not trying to be provocative but I have 2 sincere remarks/questions: - Individual choices happen in a context. Saying that men are more able than women to work longer hours or be on call doesn't take into account power relationships or cultural backgrounds. Eg. I have a female friend who was offered a big promotion at he accountant's office. She almost didn't take it because it meant she wouldn't be able to be home for diner, and she was afraid her husband wouldn't be able to cook and take care of the kids (as it turned out, he wasn't, and she wakes up earlier every morning to cook dinner so that he just has to warm it up). In this case, if she had refused the job, I totally agree that it would be absurd to say that the company was sexist. But it seems as absurd to completely discard any type of sexism in the choices that some women make. - How can we interpret the correlation between feminization of an occupation and lower wages? In Europe 50 years ago, most medical doctors and academics were male. Now it's shifting over and there are many more females in these occupations. At the same time, we notice that global wages (for both men and women) are in average 30% lower than what they used to be in those fields. Do you think it is merely a coincidence?",2,0

"Anecdote: Women often choose aspects of a job that don't have anything to do with pay. For example, my boss is a single mother who is now a department head at my small company. She used to hold another, lower paying position. She is still being paid at the scale of that lower position, even though she's been dept head for 3 years. She knows that if she left, she could make considerably more elsewhere. Why does she stay? Because she is allowed to pretty much make her own schedule from day to day, and to telecommute when she feels like it, without even asking permission. I don't think there has been a single day where she was here when I arrived, _and_ only took a one hour lunch, _and_ was here when I left.

"No one gets to be right all the time. That being said, let us pretend for a minute that a job interview is happening where the choice has not already been made about who will be getting the job long before the first interview was even held. Because some of the same qualities which men use to get ahead in business are discouraged in women within the business environment, women do not have the same bargaining power over wages which men have during an interview for a new job. The interviewer does not ever offer up front the maximum amount of money that the business has set aside which they can afford to pay the new employee. Men can bargain more from a position of strength to get that higher wage because this behavior is acceptable for men. If a woman ever wants to be guaranteed she will be paid what is right for her skills, education level and qualifications, then she has to start her own business. Ladies, Christy Wright has started a program called Business Boutique, which is all about teaching women how to start and run their own business. Google her online for more information.

"I'm surprised that schools are violating some of the personal/privacy rights of the students so transgender females or transgender males can feel good about themselves. Are the state governments in on this and is the federal government in on this? How do natural born female students in general feel about sharing washroom and locker rooms with transgender females. When I was a teenagers I didn't want to take off my clothes in front of other females. It made me very uncomfortable. I remember either changing into gym clothes in the bathroom stalls or waiting for all of the girls to leave before changing into gym clothes. I could imagine transgender females trying to get a sneak peek of a natural born female's body so they can know how they want their bodies to look if they decide to get surgeries to become more female in the future. If I was growing up now and was in high school and I even glimpse a transgender girl just checking me out for those purpose because I know I'm being watched by ANY girl, I would totally take a F in gym and skip it and stay in detention. This is how shy I was in school. I know there are still females who are like me growing up in this day and time. Whose loving them and protecting their rights/privacy? I hope their loving parents and the same school board that are protecting these two. I think all people should have equal rights. I just don't think people should just impose themselves on others based on what they feel or think. I think we should all respect each other, but I feel some people feelings and rights are being violated so others can feel better about themselves.

"I think Trisha is just confused in general. She's addicted to pills, she's done coke and meth, and she drinks. Drinking isn't that bad but she said she binge drinks which isn't normal or healthy behavior. The concoction of shit she's on is probably messing with her chemical balances in her head and she is trying to rationalize how she feels but trying to identify a certain way. It isn't right and I'm not defending her, it's just way deeper than being trans. I don't think she even understands what it means. I'm not trans but I understand what trans people go through and how they don't feel like they're in the right body. Trisha doesn't seem to have a problem with that. She's just confused.

"Yeah I can explain this pretty simply actually. I've seen one of her vids where she says that she's been diagnosed at borderline. I am borderline also. Let me just say that this is her very obviously going off the rails for whatever reasons she has. BPD is something that requires a life of upkeep, it's on the narcissistic spectrum. She obviously hasn't been able to take care of herself appropriately and is now giving in to one of the symptoms which is basically that you feel like your core identity is completely malleable. It's an identity crisis on steroids and she's trying to get back in touch with herself but she's going in the opposite direction to where she should be. Gigi probably got an earful from Trish and likely isn't so sure about it but wants to support her friend. Trish was talking a lot about her ex. If a borderline person is coming out of a good ol dumping that's when the abandonment issues can kick in. This might be what that looks like for her. Questioning her identity because it wasn't good enough for someone and rebounding into a marriage.",1,0

It's not just annoying; it's confusing for people who are really trying to figure things out. When my brother was in kindergarten, they read ""Cinderella"" to his class. He waved his hand and said, ""When I grow up, I hope I have a pretty dress like hers"". Why? Because my brother is an attention hound and went for the laugh at any opportunity. They called my mother in for a talk, which was stupid; but if it happened now, with all of this BS, he would be called transgender, and someone would be trying to give him hormones.",1,0

"Hey Blaire, I'm not a constant viewer of your channel, but I saw some of your videos and find your opinions quite interesting. (I don't agree with all of them, but hey! That's the joy of conversations xD) There's one thing in particular I always find puzzling when hearing people's opinion on the matter. And that matter would be, men and woman are biologically different, especially when it comes to the male/female brain. That is what I believe, not based on studies but what I consider common sense. Each sex has it's own good and bad attributes in varying portions. And there are people now opposing the idea that there are differences between the two sex. However, if there is no difference, that would contradict a lot of the base argument for their topics. If men and woman are the same, why make a big deal out of 'the first female (insert job here)'. It was because before women where expected to have overcome bigger hardships that it seemed like a breakthrough to get into male dominant positions. If there's no male and female characteristics, why do you wish for a female president? If there's no difference, why is it 'about time' you get one? That whole idea is based on the expectation that a woman wouldn't be as cruel as a man and more levelheaded in stressful situations (equipping her with positive female traits). This contradiction just seems quite obvious and blatntly ignored by those claiming absolute unity of man&woman. I would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps other commenters to get some ideas from different perspectives. ^^ btw I'm neither here or there on this matter. I find labels nonsense, don't care who you are, anyone can do what they want as long as they put effort into it and as long as they don't harm someone else it's fine with me.",1,0

"The ""Sex based pay gap"" is a lie. The inference by feminists is that a man and a woman working side by side doing the same job don't get paid equally. That is a lie. The pay gap is an average of ALL male and female workers across all careers. The reason men as a whole make more than women as a whole is simple: You don't see as many women choosing to work dangerous, demanding, hazardous jobs. How many maternity ward nurses are dying from black lung like coal miners do? How many social workers are 3 week long shifts non stop like oil rig workers? Or working construction on buildings with only a harness for 2 - 4 weeks without break. Men also tend to work more hours every week, so obviously they'd be paid more. EQUAL pay isn't possible unless there's EQUAL effort. So, ladies, if you want the ""pay gap"" to decrease, stop going to school to be a florist, and join a fire academy. Otherwise, shut the hell up and stop saying things like, ""Being a mother is the hardest job in the world"".

"The on going debate continues on whether there is a pay gap between men and woman and there are many arguments on both sides with opposing views on this issue. The way gap brings up the issue that women are payed less than men in the working field. Most statistics for this topic come from the Census Bureau which looks at full time workers according to Gould, Schieder and Geier. They go into detail explaining the different ways in which other people analyze the wage gap from looking at specific occupations or by taking into consideration part time jobs and how this may lead people to think that data on the wage gap is unreliable. However, no matter how people approach how they measure the wage gap, there is always a gap. I feel that those that do not believe in the wage gap look at the specific occupations or varying forms of measuring the wage gap such as Christina Hoff Sommars in ‚ÄúThe Myth of the Gender Wage Gap.‚Äù In every example she explained there was still a gap between men and women, whether big or small, a gap is still evident. Her argument claiming that it is the pursuit of happiness that steers women and men to different career paths is not completely true, there is a restriction women have due to their roles in motherhood. And according to ‚ÄúEqual means Equal‚Äù even in female dominated professions, men still get paid more. Looking beyond professional careers and taking into consideration professional sports teams. Men get paid much more than women when it comes to sports. Consider soccer, although the women's soccer team far excels in the sport over the men's team they still get paid much less than them.",1,0

"Ok, but why do we perceive female dominated professions as requiring less skills, and money etc? For example: computer programming, and coding was considered a low level menial job when it was female dominated. Yet now coders make oodles of money, and the job has a lot of respect. We respect physicians, yet in Russia where medicine is a predominantly female workforce, they have no respect for the profession there. Librarians were once respected, and well paid and even now when they have more skills and education than ever before they are laughed at, and paid like shit ever since females started dominating the profession. Teaching was also the same. I don't think women are paid less for simply being women, I think we value male work over female work. If you compare education levels for different jobs, you will find that in female dominated industries they will be lower paying than similar levels of education than in male dominated industries.

"See I have trouble with this video. It does present facts but is very biased. How does pay and bonuses compare between men and women in executive roles? How does pay compare between men and women managers and supervisors? How does pay compare between men and women in technical fields (engineering, programming, etc)? Really I could probably make a video espousing the benefits of tobacco smoking, how it helps focus the mind, increases productivity, reduces stress in stressful situations, is a mild appetite suppressant so can help with weight loss without leading to an eating disorder, doesn't cause mental instability like hard drugs do. Afterwards you might be totally convinced that smoking is amazing. At the same time the video would be misleading, because it doesn't present the risks of smoking. So yeah men and women working in low level jobs are going to be paid the same (or are they?). Men tend to gravitate to higher earning jobs and women tend to gravitate to caring jobs. But I need to see like for like comparisons in a sample of specific fields before I would be convinced. Making a video like this is just fluff for sexists and misleading for others.",3,0

"Pay gap, is it real or not? Theres so many controversial opinions about this but my opinion is somewhere in between. Information providing from some of the readings and viewings, made me understand and gather some opinions of my own about gender pay gap/gendered labor. I actually believe that men are more favored in high paying jobs than women are. In Adams Et Al. he provided some ideas and real life situations that might cause women to get paid less, hold a lower position or not getting hired at all. One of them things he mentioned was that, some businesses prefer males because in this gendered stereotypical society, women are more likely to leave work or miss work for family stuff, unlike men where they will choose work first to be able to provide for their family. Because of this idea that men focus on work more than women, it allows men to get promoted easier or get hired first. In his book, he also provided a list of equal situations for both men and women and how each of them are perceived differently. I don't necessarily think theres an accurate pay gap where a man and women with the same job title get paid differently but I do think men are likely to get promoted higher than a women in order to pay them more. In the video ‚ÄúThere is No Gender wage Gap‚Äù, she talked about how the wage gap isn't accurate because it counts for all women and all men working but it doesn't distinguishes between careers, or whether they are part time or full time. In her video, I agree that more of the higher paying jobs is dominated by men, and the lowest is dominated by women, so of course you see the difference of the pay women and men get. Like she said, it's a choice, but its also society's fault for making some careers seem gendered. For example, engineers for men and teaching for women. Personally, I'm a liberal studies major and I'm choosing a low paying job, I'm not sure why or even if I want to do it anymore because of this topic, but it was my choice to go for a less paying career.",1,0

"Women earn less, because they work less, with less workload and in less dangerous or less value-added functions, not to mention that they do not have the biological capacity of a man for specific, generally higher-paying jobs, including most of them with high exposure and vulnerability, and by themselves require more mental and physical, as well as emotional, capacity to be realized. WOMAN is Woman! MAN IS A MAN! They are NOT EQUAL !!!! .... Although they complement each other (before the emergence of feminism), THEY ARE INTIMATELY DIFFERENT !!! Women in the current matriarchal feminist parasite society demand are privileged, and without any trouble reach your requirement, and this is because of the man who did not understand anything of what happens around you overestimates, enables, empowers and rewards that the woman has not value, is not enabled, should not be authorized or awarded.

Break down Gender roles is what im saying. Its all about how we think now. The wage gap is thing of the past and a myth in todays work place, im saying this as a feminist.

"The gender wage gap is described as the relationship between men and womens pay. It is said that women are getting paid roughly 80 cents to the dollar that every man makes. The wage gap is calculated by taking the average amount full time men and women make and dividing them by each other to get the difference. In regards to womens soccer from the article, ""Pay Disparity in U.S. Soccer?"", there seems to be a pretty large pay difference between the players. However, there is also a benefit difference. For instance, women get a salary and possible bonuses along with health benefits and maternity leave whereas men do not reap these benefits but I would assume (the article did not include mens salary) they make more if they play often. I chose to watch the video, ""There is no gender wage gap"", and I do agree with some of the points that she brings up. For instance, she spoke about choices that men versus women might make that add to the variables of the pay they earn. Womens often choose jobs that are not considered to be the most high paying.Personally, I do agree with some aspects that she brings in the video. I chose to go to school to become an elementary school teacher. I could have chosen a route with a much higher pay but I enjoy working with children and love the classroom environment. Being a school teacher, I would be able to have summers and holidays off. I believe it would be a profession where I could also raise a family without having to pay thousands of dollars for childcare.",1,0

Men often get degrees based on job availability and pay. Men then seek jobs in the career field they studied in. Men are more likely to ask for higher pay. Men tend to stay at the same company for longer. Men stay in the same career field for longer. Men work more hours. Men take less time off. Men are more likely to relocate for a job. Men are more likely to convince their spouse to support their career. All of these factors increase men's pay to represent the current wage gap.

"So it's incredible retarded that this philosopher who works in a shitty university comments on a topic that she clearly knows little about. As an economist, let me comment on a few things: 1. Yes, businessman are making a monetary loss whenever they do not hire a women with lower wages, since they could potentially lower their labor costs. However, as Gary Becker pointed out long ago (a RIGHT-WING economist who is a Nobel Prize winner) if employers have both some monopoly power and distate women, they can get away with discriminating women; given that the forces of competetion won't work properly. 1.1 The same basic result applies whenever the reality deviates from perfect competition (for example, whenever there are search frictions in the labor market, or in other words, when you have to actually spend time searching for a job, which is the case in real economies). 2. Different career paths may not be ""choices"" or ""voluntary"" whenever there are gender restrictions on in certain occupations (as there are in many places in the develiping world), whenever an occupation is overly seggregated, or whenever discrimination caused an unequal distribution of math test scores, for example (women cannot really ""choose"" to be an engineer if they face a gender gap in math to begin with...) 3. Of course women work less hours, and thus, are promoted less (ever heard of the glass ceiling?) as men. Why? Because domestic work is unequally distributed, and women bear the whole burden of domestic work in most countries of the world. If we had some policies to socialize care work, as there are already in place in many developed countries, then the gap in market hours between men and women would diminish substantially. All of this is not either common sense nor a leftist conspirancy; it's just good science.",3,0

The discrimination can be explained by the glass ceiling which is the ""seemingly invisible barrier hindering advancement of women and minorities in a male-dominated organization"" (Clayton 214). Works Cited: Clayton, Gary E. Economics: principles & practices. New York, NY, Glencoe/McGraw-Hill, 2005.",1,0

Why do you think that women gravitate toward industries such as social services and education? Perhaps it is because those jobs facilitate child caring duties. It is undeniable that the majority female children are raised to see their mothers taking the lead in this regard to the point that even on an unconscious level careers can be influenced by the structural demands on women. The disparity between women and men is not just on an income level.,1,0

"Title: ""There Is No Gender Wage Gap"", 1:20 the wage gap is 6.6% ...huh? It is very true that many people use the 23% wage gap number without any nuance or detail, and that number is misleading to the point of being wrong. But arguing against the weakest version of your opponent's argument is not very impressive. The better informed concerns over the wage gap focus on career choices, particularly at universities. It's true that better paying college degrees are pursued disproportionately by men, and this video simply states it and moves on. This is the heart of the question though. So... WHY do men pursue these degrees at higher rates then women? Are parents, teachers, others in society subconsciously steering girls away from the ""boring, nerdy"" stuff? Is this a case of the soft bigotry of low expectations? Do in-school and after-school programs that teach extra-curricular like CAD, programming, electronics, etc... lean towards recruiting boys instead of girls? Are the teachers of these programs disproportionately men, resulting in more role models for boys than for girls? Does networking through alumni favor male grads because most of the alumni in well-paying fields are alumni, creating a kind of inertia that subconsciously favors male over female grads? Does society place far more pressure on women to marry younger and raise kids, leading couples to split child-rearing duties unevenly and slowing done women's careers? Concerns about the gender gap are commonly dismissed as nothing more than a pipeline problem. There are certainly feminists who want to make more out of this than simply a pipeline problem. But a pipeline problem is still a problem, and in my opinion a substantial one at that. Realists who want to solve this problem are trying to make schools, parents, and society as a whole aware, with the hope that girls feel like STEM degrees are a choice for them. But this video? It breaks the 23% gap down just enough to get to the answer it's looking for, but not enough to acknowledge or delve into the heart of the question. This video leads one to think that there's no problem here. The reality is that a deeper understanding of the issue requires finding answers to the questions I outlined above, deciding if those answers reveal problems that need to be fixed, and taking action as needed.",1,0

"In the video There is No Gender Wage Gap, it starts off by stating a statistic that a lot of sources use, that women are paid 77 cents per every male dollar. From the article ‚ÄúWhat is the gender pay gap and is it real?‚Äù, it states that women are paid 80 cents to every male dollar, which is not far off from 77 cents. The video I watched had a female presenting all the stats and opinions, which is very clever by Prager U who posted the video. Why not show a female talking about how there is no gender wage gap, it just adds onto their argument. The video states that if a person factors in different choices each gender makes on top of occupation, position, education, and hours per week, then then the wage gap nearly diminishes down to 6.6 cents. I feel as if a person cannot just factor in ‚Äúchoices‚Äù, because not everyone is in the same situation. Many women want families, so when women are pregnant they go on maternal leave, as long as they need or are allowed. Also women have been proven to do more work around the house and also take time off to be there for their kids. Women cannot be discriminated against just because of their choices. It does not matter their choices. Also the video does not take into account the fact of race. As we learned in class, black and hispanic women are paid a lot less than women who are white or asian, which is from the article ‚ÄúWhat is the gender pay gap and is it real?‚Äù. Overall we can each have our own opinion if there is or is not a gap, but the video There is No Gender Wage Gap is filled with fallacies that are opinion based and not fact and research based like the article ‚ÄúWhat is the gender pay gap and is it real?‚Äù.",1,0

"Hmmm choices, maybe it's not really choices but gender roles embedded in our society that in turn control or substantially affect these choices. Why do women chose majors like teaching or counseling or nursing, because those are the roles/majors women are generally expected to be interested in. By choosing these majors they are less likely to have to compete with males and more likely to get the job. When it comes to jobs like attorney, CEO, so forth these are jobs predominantly maintained by males and women are more likely to have to compete with them. Why does this competition matter if the woman is just as good an applicant? Oh because women are thought to have to pick up the kids when their sick, be home in time to pick the kids up from school, and have kids which means paid maternity leave, and the list goes on, thereby lessening the hours she can work and making her less competitive. That also answers the hours question.",1,0

Women have a much greater number of occupations which are easier for them to exit, and re-enter than men. Women, simply have many more employment options generally, than men. The wage ""gap"" is mostly a function of the fact that most men are employed continuously whereas that is less likely for most women..",1,0

"I like some of Prager U's videos, but the hypocrisy in this one really bothered me. To me, it clearly demarcates the TRUE bias that our short-sighted society has against women and true femininity....and it's not the kind of bias that feminists propound. We still live in a ""man's world,"" (remember that song?) where women's skills and interests, which tend to be verbal and nurturing rather than the STEM fields, and women's call to be homemakers and to care for children and family members just aren't valued economically. It really IS unfair. Many women (and yes, many men, too) spend countless hours giving UNPAID care to children, the handicapped, sick, and elderly. Our society EXPECTS this- more and more doctors are releasing patients who need 24/7 nursing- and can even prosecute someone who does not care for a family member. But then we hypocritically turn around and blame women's ""choices"" because they're not as single-minded about a career as men? Do you realize how much our society depends on unpaid people (many of them women) to check on the elderly in nursing homes, to take care of sick people, to call insurance companies and wrangle with doctor's offices, to care for autistic kids and small children? Our society could not afford to PAY people to do what lots of moms do every day. But this work has to be done, and you can't trust that a hireling will always really give your loved one individualized care (which is critically important for babies and young children.) What this video also shows it that in order to make a ""man's"" wages, a woman has to somehow truly transgender herself. She has to somehow be able to change her brain (which is different from a man's) and be able to think and act like a man, and have the single-minded career-drive of a man OR be penalized economically. This really puts women in an emotionally painful position. (and when I was a manager I saw women crying about this): either ABANDON their children in daycare all the time OR simply not have children at all. Then where would our society be in 20 or 50 years? I realize that part of the problem is due to the work of extreme ""feminism."" Our society no longer supports the traditional view of the family with husband (who has the masculine drive and time to specialize in a career) as prime provider with a ""family wage."" The change in our economy so that women are now almost forced to work in order for a family to be middle-class is probably the worst thing to ever happen to women, honestly, although I certainly think that women should have the right and option to choose a career. (I myself have a master's degree.) I'm an extreme conservative, and I understand economics. One of the areas in which I disagree with conservatism, however, is when conservatives hide behind the glib statement that people always have a ""choice."" Yes, we all DO have certain choices. But we do NOT have a choice as to our sex (as well as our race, our intelligence level, our physical handicaps) and how we are programmed biologically. Oftentimes the dogma of ""choice"" is just used by the intelligent, the wealthy, the lucky, the healthy, and the otherwise successful to justify why they should be rewarded more ($$$) in our society than others who perhaps work just as hard, but in jobs or unpaid positions that our society considers to be menial or unworthy of remuneration.",1,0

"Talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point, because even the concept ""Equal pay for equal work"", built into law, violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation.

If I prefer working with men more then with women, and thus, pay a man more than a woman for equal work, no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money. It is MY money. But the government does. It forces me to pay them equally. It forces me to give my own money to someone although I entered no legally-binding relationship with that person, but is all based on the ideological concept of 'equality'. Given the fact that lawmaker's ideological concept, be it equality or whatever, cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person, basing the laws on the concept ""Equal pay for equal work"" is a due process violation.",3,0

What influences those choices made? Why do women not choose to go into those top 5 earning professions? If you say it's because they aren't capable... That makes you sexist. If you say it's because women are reinforced that they are less capable than men from as young as 2 years old which means they grow up to make those choices... Then you agree with science.,1,0
"I get what you're saying but I think the wage gap argument is meant to be broader than what you are talking about in the video. The gap is not 77 cents big but there is still a gap. I am not saying women and men have to do every occupation 50%/50% but the choices women make in terms of going to lower paying jobs is partly due to some sexism in the workplace and society at large. A women might want to go into Aerospace Engineering for example but if she is geared from a young age to play with dolls and take care of things, she will slowly go into that career path. Also, the idea of going into a field with mostly men will be daunting because their definitley still is sexism in the workplace. Guys can easily become friends with one another and move up while a girl in an office full of boys will probably have a hard time playing her chess moves and moving up. It is all these little things the wage gap conversation is about. Its not only about the 77 cents argument because that is not correct but more so about the extra hurdles women face in the workplace. Combined this with that fact women have the abilty to get pregnant and deal wiht childcaring makes matters more complex and will affect thier pay.",1,0
"Yes, that's right - the choice is the difference. A woman is expected to take care of children and run the household. Of course she is not willing to work on call. Of course she is less willing to move - a man expects from his wife to follow him wherever he find a better job, but a woman can't expect her husband to follow her where she finds better job. As for the dangerous jobs, the reasoning is the same - the woman thinks that she has a duty toward the children and this duty precedes any high salary. Soooo... if and when a man begins take same responsibility toward children and household, the gap will disappear, but for now...",1,0

"You know... I do recall wanting to take more Psych classes because that was the major where the girls were at. However, i was the fly on the wall of a few conversations where male hiring managers did discuss how between two candidates, they female would be cheaper, but you could depend on the male. The decision was to hire the male because they valued dependability (as mentioned in this video) over saving the company a few hundred dollars (a decision they felt would cost them more in the long run)... It was only one instance. But I know it couldn't be the only instant in the world were that discussion was held behind closed doors. And I know somewhere down the line the choice of cost would be valued more than dependability. A non profit I worked for valued the latter. But the boss terrorized the employees by threatening the boot if they weren't dependable at every corner. A male worker there was discovered to be making more than his female replacement... who was wonderful and very dependable, but sadly underpaid for her service. These videos have great facts, but miss that there is an element, a bias human element, that does come into play when it comes to wages. My wife also suffered this while working retail where a male counter part at her same level, did less work, but was paid higher. And my wife was very dependable. Shit.

So saying a girl has a ""choice"" to enter a STEM related field blatently ignors the fact that girls are not encouraged like boys are encouraged to enter these higher paying fields.",1,0
"Perhaps we should ask why the overwhelming female-filled fields get paid so little in the first place? For instance, why does our society place so little economic value on education, a female dominated field? If one studies the history of waged labor, the genesis of capitalism, and women's roles within that system, we see that all of the work that has ever been ""women's work"" gets paid less because we think it is worth less (sometimes not even paid for at all as is in the case of domestic house work). I am calling upon Michel Foucault's analysis of 1500s Europe and the rise of capitalism and waged labor as is talked about in The History of Sexuality, Volume 1. Silvia Federici also talks about this in chapter 2 of Caliban and the Witch. Women were subjugated into the economic machine as unpaid domestic labor while the work of men was waged. This gave men the power to feed and house themselves and their wives while the women had no power of independence from their husbands because they couldn't make money. That legacy continues on today in a world where we still feel on some level that women's work should be free. PragerU's analysis also doesn't mention how women can't just move to other cities because they are tied down by dependent children and other social roles within families that men are not as often entangled in. This is another arena of unpaid women's work that is brushed aside and made invisible within the realm of the ""private sphere"" as opposed to the waged ""public sphere"" within which men more often work. And of course there is the well known fact that STEM areas are not always welcoming spaces to women and in fact can be quite hostile (do we all remember the Google employee who argued that women are biologically less capable of STEM work than men, a video that PragerU itself also produced and distributed? The hypocrisy!). And can we not recognize the role of generalized misogyny in all of this as well? Being a woman entails being in a world where you are constantly sexualized from the time you hit puberty, perhaps even earlier. Most women recount the first time that they were sexually hit upon by a man at about the age of 12. In an executive world dominated by men we have seen that women are often objectified and sexualized rather than treated as human subjects, peers, and creators of worth. This is a fact that has been increasingly uncovered within the #metoo movement. Perhaps we should talk about the psychological impact of having a boss or professor that sexualizes you and how that impacts your academic and career choices? And there lies the key word, CHOICES. The idea of pure choice is an illusion often harked upon by the right wing and the neoliberal minded, the idea that you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps (something that literally defies the natural laws of physics) and that the psychological reality of living within a patriarchical world as a woman is inconsequential and effortlessly surmountable. As much as you glorify the individual who can defy the odds, the sociological fact is that you end up with this 77 cents on the dollar statistic across the board. Again, perhaps it's not that women choose low paying jobs, but perhaps that a) the material reality of patriarchy does in fact push women towards certain career choices and b) the more woman that enter a field, the less those jobs pay! In the end of the day there needs to be a better reconciliation between the feminist academia and right wing think tanks like PragerU. These ideas DO need to spar head on because without direct contradiction it seems like either side can pick and choose statistics and theories to prove whatever point they want to make (case and point being this video). I think the arguments I made here validly complicate the above video and in fact nullify most of its arguments that women earning less is ""because they choose to"".",1,0

Also, the states that payed higher wages to college professors tended to hire more men than women. This study took into account tenure, education, title, publications, age, etc... It was a small study, but it did show a significant wage gap according to gender.",1,0

"After watching ‚Äú There is no gender wage gap,‚Äù it has left me with a lot of questions and some clarification on certain things. This video proves that there is a gender wage gap, but it also clarifies where and how there is a gap between women and men pay. I think that the main thing that is being overlooked would be that not all women can work full time, or half the time that men do because of child care and other obligations that they have as a woman. Usually it is just known that woman do all the housework and childcare while the man is out working and making money. Why don't women get paid the same amount that men do especially when they are doing more work then just their employed job. If the situation was flipped and women got paid more I don't think that men would let it go by as easily as the women do, not by choice but that it's just what the case is. With Professional soccer in general whether male or female, it has a lot of work put into it. The video ‚ÄúWhy is Women's Soccer so White?‚Äù it points out a lot of things that differ from men and women professional soccer teams. The pay gap with men and women ties into the soccer world because men get paid a lot more than the women do and the fact of the matter is that the women bring home more titles than the men. A quote in the reading ‚ÄúPaid Disparity in U.S. Soccer,‚Äù that stood out to me is equal pay for equal work, is this not a true statement, just because the women's team are women and not men so in the end is it just sexism taking a tole.",1,0

"Here are some factors on why men tend to earn more - * Men choose higher paying jobs. Women tend to focus on jobs caring for others - teachers, nurses, daycare, home health workers, etc...while men enjoy STEM fields which are higher paying. * Men put in more hours at work than women do and therefore are earning more if paid by the hour or earn more in commissions for making more sales. * Because men put in more hours and maybe work nights and weekends, they get more experience and are therefore more valuable which justifies pay raises and promotions. * Women often leave the workforce to have kids. This means that when/if they return, they have to start from scratch while the men who were hired originally with the women have been promoted. * Women aren't as aggressive in negotiating their pay when hired and/or promoted nor are they as aggressive in seeking/demanding promotions. * Women are more likely to stay with a company that turned them down for a raise/promotion. They are risk adverse. Men are less afraid of risk and will look elsewhere if they are passed over for a promotion or are denied a raise. Companies know this and therefore are more likely to give men that raise/promotion rather than face the higher risk of them leaving. * Since women work less than men, companies aren't going to offer women promotions if the promotion would require them to work longer hours. Women won't accept such promotions as often as men and the companies know that she is likely to turn it down so they offer it to the equally qualified man rather than having the man knowing that he was the 2nd choice. * Since women tend to seek husbands who earn more than they do, women are much more likely to have a higher earning spouse than a man. This means that the women will be less likely to accept a promotion requiring more time/travel since she may not need the money as much as the man with a lower earning spouse. the woman's husband is also less likely to accept the wife being on the job more hours and he will also be less willing to move if the woman's promotion requires it. He may not be able to make the same money if the new town while the spouse of the male employee will be much more likely to find similar paying work. These factors discourage women from accepting such promotions and knowing this, the company is also less likely to offer it to a woman over an equally qualified man. * Women with higher earning husbands feel less pressure to enter less attractive, but higher paying fields. They gravitate to jobs that they like. Men tend to have lower earning spouses and therefore are forced to choose higher paying jobs, even if it's much less enjoyable. All of the above show why men, on an annual basis, earn more than women. There is nothing that attributes the difference to sexism. It's all about personal choices that men and women freely make.",2,0

One point that I see is not very believable is that it has to do with career choices. I'm pretty sure no matter the career choice a person makes there is always a man at that job that you can compare the money gap in (Unless we're talking about strippers those are separated). If they just based it on all women then yes of course the money amount would be less but It's not about the career choice It's about the money that a man and woman makes on the same job not on the career choice of both genders. Some countries the wage gap is almost not even there but I've had this explained by people who aren't females. Just say I'm making this shit up for all I care.

Hey freelee. I am a vegan and I will be a freshman in college next year. With that being said I could really use some help with diet next year because I will not have easy access to cooking devices such as an oven or stove top if you could give some easy AFFORDABLE vegan things to eat for your regular college student that would be soooooo helpful!! I didn't necessarily go vegan for health reasons I mainly did it for ethical so if you know of any vegan TV dinner companies or anything that would be helpful please make a video!! Please thumbs this up so she sees this and is able to help broke college student maintain the beautiful lifestyle of veganism <3?,1,0

I went cold turkey vegan on the 18th!!! The first day it was fine but for the next 4-5 days I had really bad headaches and it felt like someone was stirring my brain with a fork!!

Unless you have experienced cramps from a heavy period or had to deal with boobs especially for an athlete bc bigger boobs can be a hindrance in sports YOU ARE NOT A WOMAN. you are a trans woman which is a different category. I think i feel like I'm a doctor today so why don't i go operate in some ppl. Might feel like a policeman later on and arrest somebody. I'm all for ppl living the best life they want to live but when it starts to affect someone else future that's where i draw the line if one of my children was running with these ""girls"" i would bring pickett signs to every meet",5,1

"it's pretty ""simple"". All sporting event now have to add separate categories for competition. We'll have boy's basketball, girls basketball, transgender GIRLS basketball and transgender BOYS basketball. And...you do this for EVERY sport. That way, competitors are going against others that are starting from the same biological starting point. It's RIDICULOUS to have boys/men who identify as girls/women to be competing against biological girls/women....and vice versa. Their personal preference as to their self identity, sexuality, etc....I could care less. It's THEIR life..but when it comes to organized competition....is has NO PLACE. If you have the DNA of a male....you go compete against other males, regardless of how you identify. If you have the DNA of a women, go compete against other women, regardless of if you identify as a male (unless, of course you're taking testosterone).

"Look women have fought hard to have their place in sports and still are, but it's a difficult topic of is it fair to either group. To me in strength and stamina women are at their own level and men have theirs. However, with these transgender students it's difficult to know where their strengths place, above or below the girls team. A possible solution could be to make a group for transgender athletes. One solution I'm against: taking those transgender students completely out of sports because it's not fair. Everyone has a right to partake in something that makes them happy. It's like with the first woman who ran in the Boston marathon and she did it. No man could stop her and no one should stop these kids from running. I see the girls standpoint of fairness and I also see the trans-girls standpoint of inclusiveness within the sport.",2,0

We never know what people are truly feeling or going through. As much as Trish is talking rubbish in my opinion, we still don't know about the demons she fight inside herself.. which is what we all deal with at different levels every day.

Where you have stated in a past video, you still have your penis and what have you down there. Because you would mourn the loss. So does that mean you're not fully transgender? You still want to hold on to some male parts because you would mourn the loss. So obviously you don't know exactly how it works either. I don't either. But apparently it's still open for debate what transgender is and what it isn't. And how many genders there are. So again not with any Animus at all here but who gives you the right to say she's not doing it right and you're doing it right? Not a hater. Just wondering why you feel you're an expert at it because you have a lot of followers. Would love to hear a true answer and not somebody cussing me out. You want to be accepted like everyone else and be a normal person? I got it. But here you're squashing someone else who obviously is got issues and isn't dealing with it well but at least trying to express it. I don't think you should be jumping down on a lost soul.

"Question for Blaire. When I hear the term ""transgender"", And of course the first person I think about is you, I find the term no longer applies to you. As far as I can tell, you've finished your transformation, meaning you're no longer a M2F transitioner, and anything else you do, be it, oh, idk... liposuction, nose job, bigger titty implants, anything short of the salami slice, none of those things except the last, which I selectively put a condition on, are going to create a secondary sex characteristic that you don't already have, I mean, you're gorgeous, and you know it, let's not bullshit with each other. Reason I say this is because, some of these other unicorn genders were see, like Justin Dennis' ""non-binary trans woman"" bullshit, or any of the other ""transtrender"" assholes you've dissected in your videos, there certainly have been a lot of them, they wouldn't qualify as trans, either, since they are making a declaration of an imaginary gender, and have no intention on transitioning to a male or a female, meaning the term ""trans"" is a meaningless word, which I must say, is not only offensive to my intelligence, but should be offensive to your integrity as a transitioned male to female.... I'll just call you female from here on, but I think you get what I mean.... if not, I'll clarify.",2,0

Actually acted like Michael Jackson an hung over a balcony in one of her videos idk I feel like sometimes she just likes to act like her people that's her thing. I noticed who ever she's around she becomes them almost. Also I feel like she'd been better off saying she's more Androgynous that likes femm boys. Idk maybe I'm wrong as well.

She's not trans but that would only mean she has another mental illness. I genuinely think she's confused and tries to find her identity. She doesn't have the vocabulary to express herself and that's why she's contradicting herself. You can't cancel a human being... She feels fluid and that's why she needs a therapist. She doesn't have to apologise for her confusion. Just like we shouldn't believe her and we shouldn't think she lies because we don't know. Imagine if she's right then all of the hate right now is suicide fuel for her.,5,1

Blair can you answer a question are 2 for me. Why is it that most trans women seem that they do not respect the space of natural born women? And why don't they want there own space? I think it is very disrespectful and insulting to all women that trans women think that have the right to say they are real women cause the fact remains they are not. It seems they don't even have pride in being trans. They want to be a natural women but will not and can not ever be! No disrespect it's just fact. Common sense! Thanks for your time.,5,1
"Unfortunately Trisha is being a troll. I'm so confused how people still even find her relevant. This is exactly what she wanted everyone to do.

"Um..i think this along with Most of her issues stem fm a DEEP DEEP SEEDED childhood trauma/issue. Im a firm believer in Freud's theory that children's personalities develope through the 5 stages. Freud proposed that psychological development in childhood takes place during five psychosexual stages: oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. I think something happened during trisha's early childhood...around 3 or 4yrs old. And im not saying SEXUAL ABUSE! Though im not ruling that out... But something happened and that's why she has No self control..her id gets what her id wants. She has stated she needs sex 4 to 5 times a day, that she just ""pulsates"" for no reason and Needs sex often. She goes into self destruction mode when in a relationship and fm the start of a relationship starts PUSHING that person away while at the same time being Super ULTRA CLINGY..has talked about her drug use, her drinking, her eating addiction...her impulsivity..her being attractive to WAY older men... And i think it all goes back to her early childhood. I just wonder what the fuck her THERAPIST talks to her about?!?! She needs a DOCTOR to delve into her mind..not just a therapist.

But using the trans+ community for views and attention is never okay. And it is something Trisha is prone to doing. (Jumping onto trends and saying random ass shit for views... xyz.) But at the end of the day, NOBODY defines the transgender. Every body is different and responds to figuring themselves out in a different way. There are male to female straight women, male to female gay women, male to female A+, and the exact same for female to male. She has every right to come out.... But definitely has no right to use being trans for growth. It truly can be either or. We all know nothing is yet to be confirmed. I know this is all over the place, but i just don't know how to explain my opinion in another way than this. In conclusion...... We'll see.",3,0

The way most people have reacted to her completely contradicts to what they normally preach about transgender people. They will allow predators to convince themselves and others that they can get periods and PMS even though they have male genitalia - but when a known troll comes out, suddenly they're offended?

You opened my eyes to Transgenders and it is solely you why I am able to accept the transition and why transgenders do so. At first I was afraid for my daughters using public bathrooms for fear of them seeing a man urinating in a urinal. Because of you I realized that would probably never happen and it alleviated my fear and it grew acceptance in my heart. When you denounced Yaniv (which was my worst nightmare as a mother of three girls) I instantly respected you for calling it out and how much you went out of your way and even put yourself in danger to hold Yaniv accountable! I fell in love with you because of that, not love as in romantic but love as in the way I love my family and children. I have agreed with you on every video you have done including this one. I love Candace Owens and I agreed with both of you but I had to admit you held your own with her (which is hard for a lot of people) and you eloquently stood firm to your beliefs. Thank you for being you and explaining yourself and your thoughts the way you do. In my eyes, you have paved the way for people like me, who don't quite understand the transgender transformations, to understand and even able to lovingly accept everyone. You are truly a lovely woman and keep shining your light and love to the world!",1,0

So many girls act like this, and as someone who used to read a lot of yaoi comics online, a lot of the FEMALE creators transitioned... simply because they fetishized gay guys! It's actually a thing that happens but some of them end up doing the whole testosterone thing, which is really unhealthy, and then detransition. Huge waste of time and resources. Also, thank you for not claiming to actually be a real girl. Other trans people I watched try to claim this, that they were real men (despite being born women) and Trisha was not, like honey why did you have to transition then?

I am not trying to sound like some liberal hippy, but the it is evident that exposure to certain elements will influence your thought process. From a young age, women are given Easy-Bake ovens and fashion barbies while men are given tool sets and cars. While yes, YOU are the one who chooses your career, but, you are not in control of what products are placed in front of you your whole like that direct you towards who you become. Therefore, there is still oppression with these gender roles. Also, I am sure there is a misconception about females making $0.70 to every $1.00 (And this video does a good job on clearing up some of the math), unfortunately I don't know that much about that topic, so, I won't put in my $0.30 cents on where I stand on it.

"Nice and eye-opening, thanks. (I'm also years late, but apparently that's how youtube recommendations work.) On the other hand, even IF 99% of the ""worse paying majors"" were male, I still would like to see teachers (early childhood educators included), psychologist and social workers earn more! There is no sexism in this wish either, just the thing, that these people do a lot to individuals and (in my opinion) should be valued more. This claim (that women chooose to study things that lead to lower wages) sounded a bit like blaming women for earning averagely somewhat less, but then who would do these jobs? Also if some men didn't do the dangerous jobs, who would? Trust me, there are men who would never work on an oil rig and there are women who would never even touch an elderly gentleman or lady or care for them professionally (if they can't do this on their own, I forgot the word for the home where they live then.) No, I do not compare these jobs and you should neither do that, because they are enterily different and not comparable. I would like to add the situation in my country. Beginner teachers earn circa ~628/650 USD per month without the taxes! Nurses or social workers who work with the elderly or homeless for example earn even less. I now simply don't trust my owm calculations because it seems so few (like 4-5 dollars/hour) compared to American wages. (Yes, things are a bit cheaper there and we have free universities, but my point is that these people do not earn enough money regardless of their gender.) Edit for correction of sentence-structures.

"Some of the proclaimed pay-gab is said to be because the 'mommy penalty'. A woman that choose to get a kid will drop in income because of that.

They can work part time maximum if they want to actually have time for their family. Life is all about making sacrifices. If you are working in a high end job you often sacrifice your family time and free time. If you are working a small part time job you are sacrificing your income, in order to have more free time and family time. Women generally prefer doing the latter. Women who have children who are working full time or in high end jobs, are constantly giving their children to nannies to look after. They don't have proper time to spend with their own children and raise them. It's unfair on the children.",2,0
"Simple Truth: Men in same jobs do not make same pay either, this is fact. This is called negotiation. Men do not force their employers to pay equal to compensate for their varying negotiating ability. Save for strikes and union representation.

Learn to play the game they so desperately wish to a be a part of, in a truly fair way.",3,0

"This video has a point, but it doesn't tell the whole story. Often traditionally female fields are paid less because they are mostly women. Also women are less likely to ask for a pay raise, partially bc they are more likely to be looked on as pushy or aggressive than a man would be. It is often harder for women to get to higher level positions that pay more because they aren't viewed as as good leaders, and male bosses (and even, as a few studies have shown, other women) may discriminate against women when giving promotions. Many high paying male dominated fields also have problems with sexual harassment (Silicon valley is a good example) which obviously discourages female workers. The problem is not companies deliberately paying women less, it is that it is harder for women to get into higher paying fields",2,0
I can't believe this Wage Gap Myth is still going on,3,0
"You already admitted that when you control for all the factors you listed, there is still a wage gap. You just proved that the wage gap exists, and that it's not explainable in economic terms. You also left out institutional barriers to working in higher paid positions. The argument that businesses would higher more women if the wage gap existed ignore that if women are viewed as being less valuable, then they will be paid less.",2,0

"Wasn't this lady one of the guest that spoke with Milo and Crowder? If so, she is honestly what all feminist should aspire to be like.",2,0
"Men are more likely to pick high paying jobs and women are more likely to pick low paying jobs (within the statistics provided in the video), from that you could say that the higher paying jobs are more masculine and less feminine (because of the choices females and males are more likely to make on average, representing the different mind sets) than the lower paying jobs and that our society tends to benefit masculine qualities over feminine qualities as a whole determined from those statistics. Also, the title ""There Is No Gender Wage Gap"" is very misleading when the video proceeds to explain why there is a gender wage gap. This argument comes across as very counter-intuitive. One last thing, genders occurred in our species long before we formed a currency in which to reward each other for jobs, doesn't it seem strange we have worked ourselves into a situation as a species in which occupations that are mostly male dominated are going to get rewarded more than female dominated occupations. Over the duration of time we have been evolving with these delicate and influential minds, problems like these have inevitably been emphasised and expanded from our initial nature and we should probably fix it.",2,0

"Hmm... it's blantantly ignorant to say that there is no pay gap. I mean it's clear that the average woman does make less than the average man. But it's not anyone's fault but the women who are making the choices that are holding them back from economic success. There's many variables and traits that exist within this 77 cents to the dollar thing. The largest ones but not the only ones being mother hood, the fact that women choose lower paying jobs and competitiveness. So while I agree with the statistics that feminists just need to stop bitching because nothing can be done to put more money in their wallets because it's already ILLEGAL to pay people more or less based on discriminations such as race or sex. But the message that the gap isn't real is just going against facts. They're not really anyone's fault but they are facts. Women make less than men. Fact of life.

"After seeing some comments regarding the maternity leave I have something to say if you care enough to read. Things changed so much in the last 20 years! Many developed countries have not only maternity leave, but paternity leave as well. So, usually the woman is the first who takes that leave (to recover from labor/operation and to breastfeed, if they have milk, but more and more women choose not to breastfeed or they simply don't have milk. Children's health doesn't suffer much from this factor, actually). Then it's the dad who takes a leave, and women usually leave enough milk at home, so that dad could take care of the child. There is no reason why he can't, if you think about it. For example, in Finland you see as many dads as moms walking in the park with their newborns for that reason. So there is no reason for that gap you people are referring to. Btw, statistics tells us that in the past couple of decades more and more dads take a sick leave to take care of a sick child in Europe, it's not only on women anymore, spouses are finally a team with equally shared responsibilities. After all very few families might afford for one of the parents to stay home to take care of children/home because of today's economics. So this gap, even if it exists should disappear completely in the near future, there is no guarantee for a business if they hire a man, he isn't the one who will take care of children when they get sick. And not to hire a childless woman only because in the future she might have children is not practical at all. After all, men are physically stronger, but women's health and endurance is better, and they live longer in almost all of the countries (easy statistics to look up). They fall sick rarer and take more care of their health and if they are valuable to the business, there is no reason not to hire them if they are more suitable to the position and there is absolutely no justified motivation to pay them less. Even if they take one or two maternity leaves during their career, men will take as many months to take care of their health when they fall sick or their children will. And it is beautiful, if you ask me! Children have both parents equally present, there is no better thing for them. I hope these facts are enough for you to realize why there is completely no base at the decision why to pay women less for the same work. There is no way for companies to predict the future of the employee, no matter the gender.",1,0
"Notice how the lowest paying vocations are all caring professions - which are all stereotypically womens' work. If there was no gender pay gap, the lowest paid jobs would be brought in line with the highest paying jobs, but unfortunately womens' work is not valued and therefore not paid well. Men have more freedom in their choices to relocate and work long hours because it is traditionally the woman who takes care of the other responsibilities so that he may 'provide for the family'. Unless, of course, he has none of those extra family related responsibilities (caring for ageing parents, children, cooking, cleaning, other stereotypical womens' work)... This video literally goes on to say that people without responsibilities who can be at the business' beck and call will be favoured because it suits the business. And who in society has the least responsibility to caring? Men. Traditionally they're job is to provide and protect, which in this era translates to 'bring in the money'. This video is a contradiction of itself.",2,0

But because of their age, they're paid less or more? So much mucking about. How about paying more based on experience, effort and responsibility, rather than their age? Then there's noncewood and indoctrination centres known as schools and most braindead politicians. The ones that don't live in the real world.

Obviously theirs a lot of factors that come into all these calculations and a lot of good points are raised in this video such as the dangerous work conditions. But i think with the information accessible, it is still hard to discern where the issue lies. Women are more likely to be stay at home parents whereas boys are often more encouraged to pursue these high paying careers likewise that men are more willing to work longer hours and are very possibly more qualified. I believe that their MIGHT still be a gender wage gap at play but its a lot more complex than a lot of people put it out to be.

"The earnings gap calculation suffers from *survivor bias* . Men are more willing to take on responsibility and more demanding roles. Some of them do well from this, and others end up out of their depth and get fired. The ones who get fired aren't included in the average any more, but the ones who do well *are* included. This artificially skews the average towards men. Here's the math; Let's say we start with 100 men and 100 women, each on 35k per year. The average salary is 35k a year for both men and women. Then: 20 men and 5 women move to $40k roles. 3 women do well, 2 get fired. 12 men do well, 8 get fired. (Presuming same success rate between men and women) Total number of women remaining in the sample = 98 Total women's salary 95 * $35k * 95, plus 3 * $40k = $3.445 million. Average woman's salary = $35,153.06 Total number of men remaining in the sample = 92 Total men's salary 80 * $35k, plus 12 * $40k = $3,280 million. Average man's salary = $35,652.17 So the average man's salary ends up $500 higher just from this one factor - *survivor bias*.",2,0
"Well, the calculations are indeed wrong. But there is a wage gap... this video just takes a wrong calculation and uses it to say ""yeah... everything is fake"". But the real wage gap (not that one, which is commonly used by a lot of public media and politicians) is determined by looking at men and women who acutally do the same thing in the same company at the same office. And even if most of you don't want to accept it: there is a difference. It is absolutly true. If a men and a women go to a job interview for exactly the same position and talking to exactly the same boss there is a high chance that they get different wage offers. This ist statistically proven.",1,0

These women are the people who shape our children who in turn will shape our future. They help us a lot to make the families (which is the core of our society) intact! Their impact in our society is not as obvious but they do play a big & important role in developing it.

I agree there is no real discrimination but I think that family contributes to this gap. Women are the primary caretakers of children therefore they take more time off work and men as the breadwinners often have to find a second job to support their families. I believe there needs to be done to minimize that gap since too many men are experiencing too much stress and too many women are earning less which means also less savings and a smaller pension for them in the future.,2,0

"You know what? People keep focusing on the different pay for the same job thing but, they're missing a bigger picture. Men, in America (I'm not sure about elsewhere), can drop out of high school, join a union where they get paid while they train, get full benefits, and really good wages. They can learn these trades from their dad, Uncle, anyone really, while they grow up and have a job that pays them really well right at the start of their life. My dad, knows how to do all kinds of skilled trades but, if I tried to ask him what he working on, he'd say I was in his light and tell me to go play. He's teaching my little brother about fixing cars, of course, and I'm glad. When I graduated, I got a job as a housekeeper at Days inn. I was paid based on the number of rooms I was assigned to clean and given 15 minutes to clean them. After that, times up, I'm working for free. I made $5.25 an hour and worked my ass off but made, at most, $125 a week working full time. Then I got job after job making $9 at the most. ""Women's work"" doesn't pay well, it just doesn't. So I thought ""I wanna make money like the guys do, I'll work hard, I'm not scared of labor"" and went to school for welding. Turns out, I LOVED IT. LOOOOVED IT. I loved every part of MY JOB IN AND OF ITSELF, however, I didn't love the harassment and bullying I had to deal with. I wasn't walking in with a pink helmet and crying ""girl power"" or anything ridiculous. I wore 2 sports bras, a jumpsuit, and made a point to be polite to everyone I crossed paths with while keeping to myself and staying out of any nonsense. It turns out, even if I keep to myself and try to not start any drama, when you're the only woman in a building with over 300 men, SOMEONE, some jerk, will have a problem with you based solely on the fact they think you shouldn't be there. That one jerk will multiply, quickly. Then you find the guys you thought were your friends, coming up and telling you ""I hate what's happening to you. It's not right. You're a hard worker and you do a great job but, I just want you to know that, I'll never defend you. You'll be gone eventually, they'll make sure of it, and I'll be the next target if I do"". Point is, they say ""well women can do those jobs now too if they want to"" and while that's true, and NOT every woman's experience, it was for me. I'm not talking about being flirted with, either. I can handle that. I had a manger from a department that was totally unrelated to mine, slamming his breaks in front of me on the highway and trying to drive me into a wall over and over leaving work one day. I didn't even know who it was or why it was happening until the next day when I saw him get out of the same car. No road rage, cutting anyone off, riding anyone's ass type of thing. That's just one example out of many I can give. Forget about the unequal pay for the same job part. Where's the union with paid training for ""women's work""? I mean it sounds almost stupid to say out loud but, where's the cleaners union? Or the secretaries Union? Or whatever job women are supposedly ""naturally good at"". The other day I paid a guy $125 to hook up my internet. He was 9 hours late, it took him 30 minutes, I gave him a beer and a taco to go home with (he seriously showed up at 10 pm). I cleaned someone's house the other day for $60. The lady had 6 small children she homeschooled and the house was a disaster. I felt bad for her and wound up spending most of my money on supplies/gas and it took 6 hours to clean. It was a waste of time honestly but no one seems to think anything of paying women basically nothing when they hire them but pay an electrician or plumber astronomically more money. That's the problem. No one questions that. When women were originally allowed to work, they typically had husband's that made the money and the women just supplemented the income so, it wasn't a big deal to pay women less but we're still living on that base model today and, people aren't getting married after high school now. I'm 35 and single and take care of myself. It's not like that anymore.",2,0

"I truly agree with the video ‚Äúthere is no gender wage gap‚Äù. I think having a wage gap is all mental, a trick your mind plays because we see a large number of successful people being males. An example from group 7 presentation would be the magazine Forbes, this magazine is successful people and most of the people on their front cover have been males. I has agree with there being no wage gap from the beginning of speaking about the topic but never thought of speaking out and giving my opining because I thought I would been criticized and be looked as a bias person. The fallacies in the argument is just like said in the video and command sense and its all about the choices each gender makes. Its command sense because if a guy and a girl both work at McDonald, they are both getting paid minimum wage same amount of money for the hour but all depends who wants to work more and longer hours. An example how choices is key to an argument like the wage gap would be the saying of ‚Äúfemales live longer‚Äù this is because its usually the male who pull out ridiculous dangerous stunts that sometimes kill them. Its all in the choices one makes. There is no difference on how much females and males get paid like the video ‚Äúthere is no gender wage gap‚Äù they explain how the number .77 out of 1 dollar and that is just what average females make divided by what the average male makes. All the factors that fall in to where the money goes people make counts too like said by the website ‚Äúthe wage gap, state by state‚Äù that most families depend on the females. Overall it's the factors and choices one makes that make males look like they are getting paid more.",2,0

"The fact that women earn 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes for the same work is BS. HOWEVER, let's look at why women make those choices. How dod people perceive a woman who decides to dedicate her life to her job instead of finding a husband and having kids? How does society view a women who is willing to be on call at all times? She is probably a total b*tch who is going to become an old cat lady with no friends. Okay, so she decides to get married. If she works all of the time early in the relationship to try to climb the ladder so she is earning a lot of money, people ask why she doesn't spend more time with her husband. People ask when she is going to start having children. People say things like, ""Your biological clock is ticking."" Not to mention, if the woman earns more than the man, the man is looked down on by society for not providing for his woman. On the other hand, if the man works long hours and then takes his woman on lavish vacations and buys her nice things, people look at how wonderful of a life the couple have. Now, let's say that the woman decides to have children. Having any job at all, people look down on her. Shouldn't she be home with the children? Say she's a lawyer and really values her work but the man is willing to be a stay at home dad or do something with shorter, more predictable hours on the side. Now people are flipping their lid because not only is the man not providing for his family like he should but the kids should have their mother at home with them. Flip roles, and suddenly it is just fine. The problem isn't that businesses pay 77% to woman what a man makes but that woman are pressured to sacrifice their career in a way that men aren't. That's not to say that you don't have to pick and choose what your priorities are or anything. If raising a family is more important than working a high paying job, then by all means, follow your dreams. However, that is something that a couple should discuss before starting a family and society should stay out of that families business. If the mother wants to be a high earning business professional or a lawyer who works 60+ hours/week while the father works from home as a computer programmer so that he can be with the kids, great. If the father wants to work the long hours and the mother wants to do something more flexible, also great. If they both want to work hours that are unpredictable and long, well, they should think of that before starting a family, but both parents should be held responsible, not just the mother. As soon as society buzzes off, that's when the wage gap will disappear.",3,0

"This is still where you are incorrect about any kind of earnings gap (pertaining to gender). The gap doesn't exist at all. To say that it is still only 6.6% makes anyone with this claim incorrect. This is why politics suck. A specific political stance will try to generalize everyone and think they are compatible within the generalization. We are not like apples and oranges. The comparisons are more like beets and bananas. There has been a controlled scientific study that took a singular case under extreme measures to further disprove such a myth. The males and females were of same age, applying for the same position, ethnicity and even the experience behind it. The employer was told that the first 10 being hired could not have an increased starting pay if negotiated for it and needed 5 females as well as 5 males. 2 from each gender had to fit low class criteria. The same rule also applied for black skinned and white skinned. And so it had less discriminative power, the other 2 of each gender were going to be split the same way, but of middle class. This was a closed off 5 year experiment. Do you know what happened within this study? The men did 65% more work than the average employee, all 5 asked for more hours after 2-3 weeks (this does not including job training) and 3 asked for a raise after the first year while the counterpart (female) was 30% less productive than the average employee. 2 females (one lower class black and one middle class white) took 5 days off (after 2 years). Only one of the females asked for a raise after 4 in a half years. Additionally, 4 of the males were looking for another part time job while working with the one they had.

"Cool video, but I see some inaccuracies. First off, you say the 6.6 cents difference exists is BECAUSE of choices, but that 6.6 cent number comes up when you have already factored in the difference in choices. On top of that the visual is misleading, because it shows the difference shrinking from 77 cents to 6.6 cents, which is not the case. The difference shrinks from 23 ($1.00-0.77) cents to 6.6 cents. And then you just completely dismiss the 6.6 cents? 'Oh well, we have no idea why the gap is there but just believe us when we say it doesn't exist'. Bad way to make a video. Then just say: the wage gap is so much smaller then a lot of us think.",2,0
"Well, to answer her question why business wouldn't just hire women if they're paid less: I assume that there are a number of reasons for that. The most important one is probably that a lot of male company CEOs consider women to be less qualified or reliably, so they're willing to hire men instead, even if they cost more. Also, the video presents the information rather misleadingly. For example: she says that the adjusted gender wage gap is the result of choices of the women, and that she wants to look at those choices. But she immediately switches back to the non-adjusted wage gap reasons. That gives the impression of her explaining why the adjusted wage-gap is incorrect, while she actually just explains the non-adjusted wage gap. The adjusted wage-gap is still somewhere between 80% to 98%. And even if it would be just 98%, then the question would be still there, why women should be fine with earning 2% less than men. And why are so many guys in the comment section wanting so badly the gender wage gap not to exist? What would you lose if everybody would be paid equally for the same work?",2,0

Where I work at in my department we have seven men who are all doing the same job. None of use are making the same wage. Some of us have more seniority than others. Some of use have more experience than others. And some of us simply produce more money for the company than others. Factors such as this always effect how much a person is paid even if you are doing the exact same job. And ladies I am going to tell you something and it will probably upset you so you might want to sit down.

"currently in my campus, gender wage gap is nearly nonexistent but that might be because it's a little progressive...",2,0
"I have known about the wage gap for a long time, but did not realize how significant it was. In class, we found out that some of the highest paying jobs, such as petroleum engineering, are primarily help by men, and jobs like education positions are held by woman and they make significant less than males. I think women are expected to be in these positions because of our ""motherly instinct"". What was not surprising was in some positions like serves in restaurants and retail, the gap was smaller. To me, this job works in favor of women because they are more likely to be friendly and can get tipped on how attractive they are (which is actually sexist). In regards to the US Men and Women's Soccer team wage gap, the women in recent years have been more successful and have more winnings than the men, but are still earning less. While the gap for the top players on each team are not significantly large, the further down the list, the larger the gap gets between men and women. ""Pay Disparity in U.S. Soccer? It's Complicated,"" states that women require more health insurance and there a pay cuts if they become pregnant (Andrew Das, 2016). This is a parallel to what we read in the textbook. Businesses cut a year of wages for woman because they are likely to take a year off to take care of family members and maternity leave (Adams et al, 2013). The video, ""There is No Gender Wage Gap,"" however, argues there is no gender wage gap because the studies are based off of different careers/schooling men in women have, but how can they explain the gap between men and women that hold the same job and equal amount of education?",2,0
Too bad we need someone to explain the free market.,2,0

"No mention of the biggest driver of the pay gap: motherhood. This is a perfect example of a variable labelled as 'choice' that really isn't one. The fact that, in 2017, the US still proscribes to the breadwinner model is madness, and the real reason women earn less than men, and it is a SEXIST model (no biological reason why women should be the primary caregivers, not supported by any empirical evidence worth reading). The lack of affordable childcare, access to acceptable maternity leave or good quality part-time work means that mothers are hugely disadvantaged when it comes to work. Employers are even likely to discriminate against women of childbearing ages simply because they might have kids. Now you might think 'hey, having kids is a choice that many women benefit emotionally from, so why shouldn't they get penalised economically for a personal choice?'. There's two things wrong with that. Firstly it isn't true for thousands of women who have unplanned pregnancies, and secondly, having children benefits society, especially a capitalist one that needs continuous growth to survive. So we should be rewarding mothers not penalising them.",1,0

"The title is so misleading. Though you concede in the video that there IS actually a gender pay gap, you still opted to title the video in a way that explicitly suggests that there's no wage gap. What a way to deceptively push your narrative! As for reasoning that ""no one knows for sure"" why there's a pay gap, perhaps you should've brought up the various studies, in one of which they handed out fictitious resumes with the only difference being that one was named John (a boy name) whilst the other was named Jennifer (a girl name). It found that not only was the man RATED MORE FAVORABLY, but that he was offered $4,000 more than the female candidate. I don't know about you but I believe that's gender discrimination right there.",2,0

"I am not a feminist and this video does set some facts... but without drawing the conclusions from them. I have to say that 1) as a woman I observe that men are sometimes, if not regularly, macho towards women, even in a way that they may perceive as ""normal"" or harmless, I don't believe it's always purposely mean... but therefore they do not respect women entirely while it's much, more more rare that a woman would have any kind of despise towards men just for being men; women usually value men as much as themselves... 2) if it's true that women often make choices that lead them to less well payed jobs it's partly because they are surrounded by social messages that tell them some jobs are for men and they wouldn't fit in it. I'm not saying it's caused by all men nor that all women suffer from it... but it's true for a certain prcrentage of people,, and may explain the ""unexplained wage gap"" in this video, which is ridiculously presented as unexplained while the answer is, I'm sorry, quite obvious, and quite real... Once again, i'm not saying that women are all oppressed by men, but men make the more social oppression, as they make the more sexual assaults... take this as a remark from someone who doesn't care about gender when looking at someone but about respect and truth",2,0

"Also, people obsessed with the wage gap, I want to make this as clear as possible. Going around and blaming some secret sexist cabal of men and taking it out on your co-workers and claiming that they're women-haters or w/e is stupid. Men and women, in theory, strive equally to get paid and earn raises. However a store that employs 20-50 people may have only 2-3 people actually in control of the salary. Those two to three people may, or may not, be as sexist as you think they are, but taking it out on your co-worker who is more interested in getting home to snuggle up to his SO and spending time with the family and is doing his best to keep himself awake and in a positive mood while pouring over boring as hell spread-sheets or putting up with some idiot customer who firmly believes that '50% off' applies to every item in the store instead of a specific product is only going to earn you animosity. He probably doesn't set the wages. He may even be mad as hell that he's putting in overtime and working extra hard but got passed over so the CEO could give himself a nice bonus. He may even have a wife/sister/daughter who isn't getting paid what she should be and the entire family is suffering for it or he's doing his absolute best in his dwindling spare time to fix that. Accusing him of sexism is about as useful as getting mad at a chicken and accusing it of causing obesity.",2,0

Mainly, I didn't understand where it was coming from, truly. I am in a similar spot as some other younger trans people and I have to say, things like this DO NOT help. It's improper representation of Trans people, and it's awful how Trisha felt the need to capitalize, as you mentioned. But when this is one of the more trending videos, this is what people associate us with. And it is hurtful because it does indeed feel like Trisha is mocking our very real struggles. Also, I have learned so much about how to discuss these things (across your videos overall!) that helped me shape my own understanding. I just wish at the end of the day we honestly could help eliminate these problems. I'm just surprised that Gigi being a trans woman herself would support Trisha.

"I was on a butch and femme internet forum. Many femme lesbians claimed that they are transgender. I wondered why? They told me that gender means the social role of a woman or a man. And they have a diffrent gender role as a ""woman"" They live not the ecpierience of a heterosexual woman. That's why they live a diffrent gender as a woman. Thats why they see themself as transgender. I can not describe it as well as they did. . but I think I described the reason as good as I understood what they told me. Well the opinions diverge.. For me I am trans, I can not agree with those ""femmes"". But I am also male as well as female. Not on body but on my inner being. I transform between the two.",1,0

"I don't get why she would even troll about this. Then again, I'm not Trisha and I'm not such an attention whore.

Most of the younger ones have a lot of other issues too and believe those should be treated first. Depression is shite, anxiety is shite, PTSD sounds like hell. No matter how you look at it, a lot of trans people need help in more ways than one. I don't think Trisha's behaviour helps one bit. It does feel a little bit insensitive and the Internet just isn't the place for these kinds of troll vids. It would fit better on stage, in the show of a comedian. As a side note: I get annoyed with the 'gender is a social construct' thing. Technically gender is a social construct (if you view in the way that gender is the way you express your feminity or masculinity, which nobody means when they use the word gender in this context), and sex is biological. However, when people use it interchangeably, I'm thinking they're wrong. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a need for certain people to even feel trans nevermind actually go through the medical roller coaster in one way or another.",5,1

"Maybe all transsexual woman should stop using transgender to define themself. Becaus our true specificity is transsexual. Few years ago i had big fight about those transsexual who wanted to exclude the ones who choose to keep there genitals and named them as transgender. But this is not reality. Being transsexuals is about hormones and not surgery. Someone who remove the penis does not make this person a transsexual. A man whitout a penis still is a man but named eunuch. So to remove a sex genitals does not make a transsexual. This is the fact and the truth. It is only by the hormones that we become a woman and change our body from inside. It is the hormones that grow breast and modify our shape. SO! All of those who are on a therapy of hormones to change there gender become transsexuals. There is no shame to use this word. It doesn't make you a sexworking person using this definition. If this is why you choose not to use the real definition. Transgender is a generic noun to put everything in it even the alien, anybody who play with there look by fantasy or anybody who is delusionals about things related to the human state. Transsexual is a specific noun and only people on hormones can be name like that. It exclude all the others and by the way things are going, It is better. Transgender noun is harmfull for us by the way non-binary and else has use this to put discord in the society. By doing so, they destroy all the sensibility build by the pioneer from the last 40 years or more. This is what we can observe. I am a transsexual woman. When some people come to me and ask if i am a transgender, i correct that for transsexual.

"Trish Paytas is a prime example of how a weak-minded moron can be convinced of extremely high end bullshit easily. In the future, this sort of shit is going to be considered an alternate form of Munchausen's Syndrome. The only barrier to it now is that these ""stunning and brave"" (gag!) morons...uhhh individuals are getting mainstream acceptance, and the thing about that is, it really isn't helping them any. In fact, it's doing the opposite. If someone wants to know how this works, it is entirely possible for a parent to hate their child and at the same time, smother them with appears to be love at the same time. How does it happen? Shelter them from life. Don't let them grow up. When a parent loves their child as if that child is THEIR possession, like an inanimate object, that's going through the motions of love, and doing bad things to their child in order to keep that child how THEY want that child to be, to an unhealthy extreme. OR.... your child is unhappy and they tell you they just don't want to live anymore, and you hand them the gun, because it's what they want, after all. I would argue that a hovering parent or a helicopter parent can actually be worse than a lackadaisical parent. Neither parent is giving their children direction in a proper fashion. On one hand, you have children who have no supervision, no leadership, and and direction, leading that kid to seek other people for direction, more often than not, we're talking the wrong kinds of influences, here.... and to tell the truth, most of them are the exact same way.... no parents being a parent. On some level, they know what they are doing is wrong, or bad for them, but that doesn't stop them from becoming psychopaths, sociopaths, drug addicts, thieves, gang members, or any number of other types of criminals out there. With a hovering parent, the child is clearly in control, and it's the parents' job to make sure nothing bad happens.While this may generate fewer bad seeds in number, these little fuckers are far worse than the other side, because these little shits have their parents to cover their six when they start fucking up. They have a mandate to be assholes, and never have to deal with the consequences because the parents keep those little fuckers from ever experiencing consequences, so their bad behavior starkly overshadows all but the worst of the children raised in lackadaisical environments.",5,1

"This is explained by the fact that all the higher paying jobs demand more time working when women are still expected to take care for children. It is because the hour aren't flexible enough that THERE IS A GENDER PAY GAP. Corporates don't choose women even if they work at lower wages because they are not viewed as workers, but rather as women who have to be available to their children. At home, tasks are still managed almost entierely by women even when both parents have full time jobs. The gender pay gap therefore exists. You should be ashamed to post such ignorant content.",2,0

"One variable that I don't see discussed very often is negotiation. I started a new job recently and whilst going through the application process, the company made an offer.

It's quite possible for two people with identical qualifications, doing a the same job and even recruited at the same time to be getting paid differently just because one was prepared to take a risk and negotiate, whereas the other just took the initial offer put on the table. Studies have shown that men are (on average) more likely to negotiate when an offer is put on the table.....probably because men are bigger risk takers, and this could certainly explain some of the residual wage gap after things like qualifications, experience etc are factored in. Again - negotiating (or not) is a choice people make. If you chose not to negotiate, can you really feel aggrieved because you end up getting paid less than somebody who did.",1,0

"In the video, ‚ÄúThe Myth of the Gender Wage Gap‚Äù it explains how even though might be a wage gap for women to men it is not large as most individuals believe it is. The first time watching the video I was convinced that the wage gap may not be a big deal. Although going back to what we have learned in class. Especially in the lecture from monday we learned how the wage gap is very noticeable. Christina Hoff mentions good topics to prove her point, the one that struck out to me was ‚Äúif women get paid less, why don't business just hire women‚Äù they are less cheaper. Hoff has a strong stance when she explains how feminist individuals are not implementing important factors such as hours worked, positions, and education when they are calculating the wage gap. This convinced me that the wage gap might not be as dramatic as people think it is after all these factors are implicated. In the article ‚ÄúWhat is the gender pay gap and is it real?‚Äù it shows how adjusted measurements will be made to increase the possibility to use statistics for the wage gap. Women have a lot of responsibility and some even say more than man. For the majority of women they are the ones in charge of picking up their children and taking care of their necessities like appointments and activities such as sports. Therefore all this responsibility has made women take fewer hours in their jobs or not work at all. It is hard to conclude a solid stance because of what both side of the wage gap leave. From the leader presentation we learned how clearly women do not make the same as men. Although from the video once other factors are entered it changes things. So when will we receive the actual unbiased information ? In American household, men make more money than women therefore most women work part time jobs or do not work at all. If men and women are working the exact same job, hours, education, capability and there is still a wage gap then more things should be done to stop it but only until the statistics are true. In this country, I believe that women still have a lot more freedom to make their own choices, than in other countries.",1,0

"It's nice that this video marshals research for evidence, but unfortunately it's very selective and biased. Most glaringly the argument ignores decades of research which has looked into the role of gender and negotiation in perpetuating the wage-gap. On average, for example, women are less likely to initiate negotiations for their salaries, less likely to counter-offer, and more likely to make greater concessions. And while this is a choice, it does NOT follow (as the video tries to claim) that preference and sexism are incompatible. On the contrary, what the research shows is that when women negotiate assertively on their own behalf they are perceived as acting in a stereotypically incongruent manner (i.e. not relationship oriented) and are therefore viewed negatively by their counterpart. In other words, women have to face a trade-off between power and likeability that men do not have to deal with (which is kinda of like the definition of sexism). As a result, in a conscious and strategic effort to avoid social backlash - to dodge being perceived as ""pushy"" or ""nasty"" - women tend to either avoid negotiations all together or be less competitive. Hence they get less. Over the course of a career these numbers really add up. Fascinatingly, the negotiation gender-gap all but disappears when women are asked to negotiate on behalf of others: they are more comfortable being aggressive and are less likely to be judged harshly for doing so (as women who negotiate on behalf of others are not violating a stereotype). Yet this ""representation approach"" tends to put a lot of people in a difficult bind: perpetuate a stereotype or wait till the system is transformed.",1,0

"I believe you may have misunderstood the argument. The argument is not that there is a literal gap in which at the same job post women are paid less than men. It is that systematically, women are prevented or discouraged from obtaining higher paid work for a number of different reasons: men are seen as more powerful, wise and omniscient, women are more likely to be the primary care-giver to their children, women are more often than not disrespected in positions of authority because of man's insecurity etc.",1,0

We need to advocate for encouraging young women and showing them that they are capable of pursuing careers in male dominated fields. The expectation that women must be the primary carers for children (which in itself is no issue, but the expectation is!!) is another problem that forces women from getting demanding jobs. This video's points did not address this problem at all, and instead made the points supporting the inequality argument much clearer. Systematic sexism is the problem, not an abundance of individual sexism in each employer. Focus on the real issues please, not responding to a tangential point.",1,0

"You know, I would hazard a guess that the reason women take lower paying jobs and work shorter, less consistent hours is because of the social pressure and gender roles that dictate that they should. Females are encouraged to take lower paying professions because those professions are often more traditionally feminine. Typically female dominated areas will probably seem safer for women to take and typically male dominated areas will seem safer for men to take. Women may work fewer hours because they are expected to care for any children, children they are expected to have.",1,0

Also, you account Women's maternity leave yet not a man's so that the gap seems closer. I think both the extremist feminists and conservatives are both fabricating statistics.

"Its funny to think about that when people aren't killing each other in war they occupy their minds with this sort of thing. Like the wage gap isn't that big of a deal at all (I'll explain why I said that later). The only reason this is going on is that in the modern world we lack the stimuli from tragedic events we as a species are used to so we have to come up with our own. And I'm not saying that women aren't discriminated at all but so many people misses to understand the fact that things have never been better. Its naive to say that the patriarchy is behind all of this when in fact in the last decades we have been moving so much forward in this field. It isn't as simple as to just move forward from the way of thinking that men are superior because in the past that was true due to physical attributes that were necessary i.e. hunting and warfare. The way of life we have now is so small portion of the human history that its almost idiotic to say that women have it bad. So my point is that it is important to drive EQUALITY forward but please understand that it isn't an overnight thing.

The greatest thing about this is that a woman is speaking and has sources from a feminist organization.

"Uber did a study on this, too. They found the exact same percentage gap existed, but not because women were paid less. If anything, Uber is renowned for its equality-focused business model. Instead, women were more willing to work more flexible hours, stayed in the Uber system for less time and weren't as competitive as men with regard to where the best spots were. The wage gap existed primarily due to experience behind the wheel in the Uber system, where men spent longer hours and were more driven (pun intended) to earn the most out of their position. They deduced women had more obligations, such as family, than men and are more open to reviewing their choices by transferring from one job to the next. Men, on the other hand, are willing to find the most profitable position and stick with it regardless of how it goes. It reveals the key psychological differences between men and women seem to reflect their earnings.",1,0

"How is this so hard for the public to realize? There is no wage gap, nobody in there right mind would pay others less or more based on their gender, the only gap would be based on there physical and or mental capabilities. But there is no gap in reality, it is a factor on a few different things that cause the ""wage gap"", it is the fact that women end up not choosing fields that earn them as much, for an obvious example, there are many more male doctors than female, and on the other side, there are many more female nurses than male nurses, they both are in the same field, but there is a clear difference on what they end up choosing. Also, if you ask a lot of girls on what they want to be, ones that choose medical fields end up saying ""I want to be a nurse"" much more than ""I want to be a doctor"", that is the equivalent of somebody saying that they want to be a co-pilot, maybe that comparison was different, but there is an obvious correlation in all fields with this. Just like you will see a lot more hostess' at restaurant than hosts (female = hostess). Another besides that is the effort it would take for females to do certain tasks, such as heavy lifting ones, or dirty ones, clearly men go into that field because they are genetically by far better, and they would need 2 or more women to complete a task than 1 man for most cases. I can go on with a lot of details but the last would be things like maternity leave, causing them to literally miss work for months because they had a child, which is understandable, but if you want that to be on your options, you need to take less pay, or you just don't get paid leave.",2,0

"There is still a problem: women still staying at home taking care of the kids because the majority of men refuse to. That makes quite a portion of women in marriage leave their jobs and not make any money. It affects statistics. It doesn't mean that women are paid less, just like you said, but it is still sexism. Another problem may be the way we are socialized. A study shows that women in general have way less self-esteem than men. This influences career chooses. While men tend to go for a harder degree, women, with the same grades, go for a easier one. That happens because men usually overrate their capabilities, while women do the opposite. That kind of justifies the fact that there are so many men studying engeneering and so many women at magistrate degrees. Another fact is that, wherever there is a space with a high proportion of male presence, that space is masculinified and it pushes away many women from taking a step an being part of it. At last, but not least, there are some studies which show that women tend to choose careers in relation to caring of others (like pedagogy related degrees or healthcare). And those, of course, are not tastes we are born with. There are a whole lot of psychology studies that show us the evidence about that (I say that as a psychologist).

As soon as you disagree with something they say and counter it with facts, you're just an offended and insecure and most importantly MANSPLAINING ""broflake"" or something like that. Basically, all the time when a dude disagrees with something a feminist says, he is instantly met with ad hominem attacks or other forms of highly arrogant and almost narcissistic answers. I can't recall a feminist that actually started to engage in a discussion in which he/she actually replied to my comments. It basically always follows this scheme: 1.) Initial comment based on perceived truths 2.) countering that statement with actual facts 3.) ad hominem attacks and bringing up more unproven claims while ignoring the facts from the first answer 4.) countering the new claims with facts as well 5.) fleeing into conspiracy like excuses (example: ""WELL THE PATRIARCHY RAISES US LIKE THAT!!!!"" when you showcase how the pay gap is a result from individual choices) and further ignoring the stated facts or simply claiming they are wrong without providing facts and evidence to support the claim, that the aforementioned facts are really wrong",3,0

"To be fair, there ARE misogynist people in SOME positions of power who tend to not promote women as readily, not employ them or discriminate against them in other ways. It really does happen and it's not a thing that should happen. And this could explain parts of a wage gap. However, most people aren't like that. And you don't tackle an issue effectively by exaggerating it to the point of absurdity and thus ruining your credibility in the public eye (like most feminists these days do).",2,0

"I'm pretty sure that if a women picks a dollar up off the ground that it's actually only worth 77 cents. While if it were a man, it would be a whole dollar. As such I found myself in a particular issue when my 6 year set of twins (1 male, 1 female) brought up the wage gap difference. To fix this I found that the average 2$ tooth fairy gift per tooth would be balanced by my daughter being provided more coins to equal the values. They are both super happy that I had talked to the tooth fairy for them. The tooth fairy tends to leave a little extra though, providing the $2.75 for my daughter. While this is a little more than the proper balance of money from the wage gap, which my son isn't too okay with. I see no problems with it. When they get older and I have to pay them to clean their rooms, I'll probably end up doing the same thing as the tooth fairy, that way everything is fair.",2,0

These things are unarguably important and no less essential to a functioning society than petroleum engineering. So why does so little money flow there, making the jobs even more unattractive than they already are? The way different working fields are rewarded directly reflects on what values a society holds.

"While this is all true, It doesn't question WHY jobs that are primarily male occupied are paid more than jobs that are female occupied. Why are teachers paid less than say advertisers? Because this is Capitalism, and your value is determined by your contribution to the flow of money (out of consumers pockets into the hands of the top 1%). If you can make money for the biggest companies that are all controlled by just a few hundred people, either by creating a product, marketing that product through the media or by being an influential actor or athlete, or by altering the publics view of your company in a positive way, then you will be rewarded with a big paycheck. Many govt jobs are male dominated as well. But why don't women gravitate to these higher paying jobs as often as men? Because of gender roles instilled in us since birth. Men are told at an early age to be tough, not show emotion, be confident, and that their worth is determined by their personal drive to succeed and be the breadwinner. Woman are told, either directly or indirectly through the media, to be nurturing, respectful, not be too loud or else be called bossy or a bitch, and that their appearance is what matters. Some of these things are less extreme than in past years, and more women are entering STEM fields, but turn on a tv and its clear they are still common tropes. Society shapes who we become and the choices we make, and it's clear that white men are in the highest positions of power in this country and decide what we see and hear in our daily lives. Why would they not push messages that keep them in power? Just look at trump and his rich white male cabinet. Another thing to consider is that when women do end up in male dominated fields such as the oil business they are often harrassed and considered inadequate for the job. This video also ignores the study that found when two identical resumes are submitted to employers with the names John smith or jane smith, john gets hired more often. This video is too simple for such a complex problem.",1,0

"Just because a wage gap ISN'T necessarily 100% the cause of employers intentionally saying to themselves ""I think I'll pay 'x' group less"" doesn't mean that wage gap is automatically innocent (or rather, that ONLY the portion which we can DIRECTLY connect to an explicit intent to discriminate as the cause of the gap is problematic and/or unfair and/or discriminatory). As the narrator herself points out--there are MANY possible explanations, including factors influencing these ""choices"" men and women make (as if ""choices"" have EVER occurred in a vacuum, free of human or natural influences on one's considerations, one's so-called ""free"" choice). It is still entirely possible that the difference in career choices and educational opportunities can be explained less by women's willingness to accept lower compensating fields of work, but instead the tendency of the WHOLE society (many of those women included, yes) to segregate and/or self-segregate women in to particular kinds of work and roles (that may, or may not, be paid or paid as much as roles society, at least much of society historically, has preferred to push men towards and women away from as much as possible--with varying degrees of explicitness).",1,0

"According to the broadcast ‚ÄúWhy Is Women's Soccer so White?‚Äù one of the main reasons for it is that that these youth players are preferring to play for clubs rather than just to play high school soccer. They see the need to play for clubs because since the women's soccer is not as major as for the men's soccer team despite of how well they perform as compared to the men. It was mentioned that some clubs were as high as $7,000 per teenage girl. When we compare national team clubs to high school soccer, it is notable that not everyone will have that type of money to pay for their girls to go off to play. It all has to do with socioeconomic and the parents who have this type of money due to their higher incomes are white. Thus this is one big reason why there is so little diversity in the women's soccer team. Shifting to the video ‚ÄúThere is no Gender Gap‚Äù the overall message is that there is only a 7% wage gap and not more as others make it seem. They mention how basically it is the women's fault because of their career options which impacts how much money they make. However what they don't realize is that out of all the job options they have there is only .04% of jobs that pay women and men equal. So how are they expected to choose wisely when there is hardly any options for them to choose from? It is sad to see how even with the same education the gap still remains just because women are seen as less reliant because they are not able to work at all times due to motherhood and all the other household responsibilities women have on top of work. They mention how it is not sexism but all of the previous states otherwise how men are more capable of doing certain jobs and they are less of a burden for employers. Moreover, according to Adams et al. of section 3 Classism, women's average pay is at 77% of men's compensation. Throughout their whole career women only make 44% of what men make. It was mentioned in the reading how discrimination is part of it but also because women are not always able to work the full time and thus if you need to be absent for a period of time from work, it is a stiff penalty in declining their career and slashing the pay. The lack of daycare and flexible job options makes it really hard for a woman to work the same amount of hours as a man. Overall I think it is important to analyze this further and note how it is not that they are not telling us the truth or they are doing bad math, they are sharing the actual facts and truth on what women have to deal with.",1,0

Anorexia/bulimia recovery is honestly the hardest thing I've ever done and there are so many things going on with my body right now but i know that it is the best decision I've ever made. I was wondering if you could make a video and touch on this a bit more? I know you have a few videos that talk a bit about it but maybe you could go a bit more in depth?

i hope she doesn't! but i feel like she will give up if she doesn't see progression. there won't be any progression because there is SO much fat between organs! she wont see any progression because all her efforts will first burn the fat that she cant see.

Thinking life would be easier with male genitalia does not make you transgender. You can support the LGBT community without being a part of it. You can dress and act masculine without being transgender. You can have short hair without being transgender. Trisha this is extremely offensive to the transgender community.,1,0
"I think you are just sick of how men treat women. How society makes us think we have to look a certain way...guys dont have as much pressure. I am female and love gay men, I think because they are more sensitive. I have very few female friends because it is always a competition. I dont like them. Women like to tear others done to make themselves feel better. I also feel like a man somedays but that just low self esteem. It is easier being a man when it comes to looks and stuff. I think you are confusing these normal feelings with being transgender. You are tired of putting on a ""show"". Best of luck.",1,0

"Meat substitute products are not the answer: they do not offer the same nutrients. Please note: I am not working at all for the meat industry. I just want to point out that animal protein is closer than vegetable protein to human protein. Animal protein is thus absolutely essential because it is much better assimilated than vegetable protein, even when combining legumes and cereals. You can be vegetarian and healthy provided you eat eggs and dairy. But definitely not vegan. Deficiencies will appear sooner or later. I have heard plenty of testimonies by ex-vegans who described the same symptoms: general weakening, intense pains in the muscles, tooth cavities, bloating...

Japan is affected by heart quakes from threat from leaders who own the private bank corporation. Let's especially not forget how the only countries in the world who aren't under the world bank are the Middle East. And they are the only countries in a war. A war started by, you guessed it, the ones who use these energy weapons, artificial weather, have been at war every single year for the past 200 years, has every politician bought out and paid for, is the United States of America's.

You mustn't believe your self. Strong neglect because you're conditioned by birth to think on the contrary. Conversely though it's foreseen by thousands of government officials all of this disclosed information and other countries who suffer. America is the laughing stock out of all of them, we're blind to the truth and within blind faith we believe we are free. Our freedom is an illusion that our vote matters let alone count. All of these problems resonate upon our disbelief it's even happening. We are the reason all of this is happening because we settle and agree on it as a republic democracy. We're a totalitarian corporate oligarchy sitting on a time bomb so far we can't even stand up. If we stood up it would all blow up. Metaphorically if we all stood up together it would all collapse under the new world order in control by the elites of this world. The bank owners. Rockefeller's, Rothschild, corporations have long paid out politicians and government officials to carry out their agenda. That's why you never see anything happen.

"Its Whole Food Plant Based. Period. Nothing else will save either Your Health nor the Environment and Dignity of the planet. I have never experienced such long-term positive change in myself before!

As for the latter, turning the anglophone public around is probably the only way to tackle this - so we obviously have to go for fake meat etc. Anyway, I started my plant based transition in December 2016, and it was triggered first of all by VeganGains, in whose sources I instantly found Dr Greger, which led me to Neal Barnard, Dr Klaper and the rest of the cool gang.. Despite having seen various slaughterhouse documentaries (most meanwhile unavaillable in YT) in 12 years (what the health and h.o.p.e. being baby shit in comparison to some), it took the health argument to empower me of permanently eating plant based, contrary to ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY, contrary to MY PHYSICIANS ADVICE. Only one of my friends switched over to our side but fell back a couple of months later. Meanwhile I find that here and there I find people who at least sympathise with the plant based idea. Most educated women say ""I would if I could/if my husband would join"". Men say things like ""Don't touch these potatoe peels - they are for my rabbits!"" Some however pay credit for my consistency, admitting they would like to be able to hop on the train. Also, the climate argument came only later, in 2017.",2,0

"No one these days can live a healthy life without topping up with Vitamins. Eating murdered animals does not bring any of the nutrients claimed by the food industry. A big con from way back. The animals are fed tainted poisoned food. Nothing healthy about that. Besides the plus of a healthy cuisine, the ethical part for me are the animals. This is an upgrade in civilization and humanism. We've known the past littered with lies - colonization, slavery, women's rights for all there was an explanation and voices standing in horror to those who fought against it. Vegan cuisine is spectacular! Living with no blood in our hands, mouth or guts is sanity and compassion. B12, Magnesium, iron, Vitamin C should be taken by everyone. And topped up with regular check ups. This is for everyone. I see people of 60 where I live, looking old, old. Terrible colour, bent over, limping, miserable, diabetes. The said marvelous Mediterranean cuisine. They eat the eyes, the paws, the entrails and they're paying the huge price. Vegan is everything good and more. It's not about the food it's about the inability for many people to take responsibility for what is good for them. Booze, drugs, pharma drugs, smoking, guzzling food, everything that is bad they fight back not because it's bad but because they're wimps addicted and unable to fight back.

"If everyone went vegan, then the demand for vegan based food would rise, unfortunately vegan based food does not last all year due to seasonal changes, so food has to be sourced from other regions of the planet. In the meantime large acres of cleared land will sit dormant in the colder seasons, awaiting a warmer climate before crops can begin growing again. The price of food will rise significantly due to the capitalists control of the markets. Being vegan isn't going to save the planet, deforestation is the leading cause of climate change which will continue to expand as Global capitalism takes control. What you eat is irrelevant...",3,0

If carrots, soy and celery gets you off the sugars and carbs, full power to you. If the meat and dairy gets you off the carbs, full power to you. All food is produced at some cost to the environment, get over it. Rubbing a pigs belly is nice and sweet, but if the vegans get their way, there ultimately won't be any of these and other animals left and in the next few years when this experiment proves to fail, it will be too late. Enjoy your honeymoon on this diet but your long term health reality check awaits you. We have 60 harvests left before the earths agricultural soils are depleted or are simply blown away in the next dust storms.what then? I have no right to force you to eat animal products and you have no right, particularly on ideological grounds, to tell me I can't. My meat and eggs etc.in Australia, are grass fed and finished, and the cows replenish the fields in which they reside to regenerate the soil with their droppings. They drink the water which falls from the sky. If the Americans are caught in a never ending spiral of factory farming and all that it entails, then they need to get their house in order.

Once we realize eating animal products is actually bad for us, and we don't need to do it, then we no longer need to accept consuming animal products no matter what the rationalization, in which case we can see it for what it is.

"I do love that household chores are listed but yard work isn't. How about auto maintenance? Building projects? DIY chores? I'm a stay at home dad and my wife still does way more household chores than I do but it's not because she's oppressed but because she is willing to clean the whole house if I do the bathroom. Cleaning the bathroom sucks and it gross but it takes me like an hour a week so I just do it. It's the same deal with mowing the lawn. I've never brought up doing it to her other than to make the point about what I do around the house because I like doing it. I take a great deal of pride in my yard but when it comes to cleaning out the dog kennel (Bernese Mountain Dog, Bernese Cross, two Boston Terriers and I run a Doggy Daycare), that sucks but it still needs to be done. Again it buys me a lot of chore credit so I accept it and just do it. The problem with assessing people's personal choices at home is the lack of context. My wife would love to stay home, clean the house and take care of children but she got a really good job that turned into a great career and it's not cost effective.

"When I saw the title ""What people miss about the gender wage gap"", I thought it would talk about how blatantly the ""wage gap"" is calculated (by just dividing the average earning of a male by the average earning of the counterpart female), but nooo. This video, along with CERTAIN feminists (yes, not all feminists are alike, just like how all Muslims aren't terrorists), politicians, and celebrities COMPLETELY ignore the fact that some women choose different careers and work hours (hey, by the way, the number of employed men that are ALIVE should also different from the number of EXISTING employed women, well, that's just a hunch, and I'm 14, so judge what you will). Furthermore, just for a second, let's assume that the wage gap IS, in fact, real, and women get paid 77c for every dollar a male makes. That said, why, for what reason, don't ALL companies hire ONLY women since it is 33c cheaper than hiring a male? Don't companies want the most bang for their buck and not spend more money than they have to? This would save tens of thousands, maybe MILLIONS of dollars every YEAR if their workforce only was comprised of women! Well, who knows. Anyways, I am not trying to diss women here, please, that is not the message I am trying to get across (if that is how you feel, I apologize). Moreover, I do concede that women DO work less than men (in most cases) due to their schedule, and that is what this video talks about, and THAT is what we should be worrying about. And for that reason, I did not dislike the video, but nor did I give it a thumbs up. So fighting to get rid of the stereotypical notion that women should be at home, solely responsible for the kids, is the REAL war we should be fighting, and we are. We are progressing, but we are obviously not there yet, and EVERYONE SHOULD be contributing; this also isn't just about women, but everything that concerns another human's well being (paraphrased from MLK). So, there isn't anything wrong about a feminist, or any advocate for that matter, as long as you are well educated. So what I'm trying to say is, ""earning does not equal wage"" (cookiopuss ps, Youtuber), neither is the earth flat, and thanks for reading all of this, if you did.",3,0
"male logic translation, women make choices that affect their income negatively while men do whatever it takes to clime the corporate ladder. The wage gap is a myth. Here is proof, If you are a C.E.O and you can hire women at 77 cents on the hour to the dollar an hour a man works for the same output in labor who will you hire? IF you want to get rich the answer will always be the woman since she is cheaper labor. That is simple economics folks. The reason that woman are not dominating the workforce because of this logical choice is because they make decisions that adversely affect their work performance. Taking time off to raise kids and inflexible schedules is bad for business. so you make less for those reasons ladies. No man is oppressing you, You did it to yourselves. So maybe quit blaming your bad choices on men ok. Also just so we are clear paying a woman less for the same work is discrimination and there are laws against it. since you never hear of women winning lawsuits then these companies obviously are not in violation of said law so your wage gap argument is invalid.",3,0

"From most studies I've read through, the data seems to always point towards childbirth. Most women have to take quite a few weeks off because of this phenomena, so when they return, their income tends to lessen compared to if they didn't. Therefore, one of the easier ways to end the wage gap, is to give paid family leave to the mothers and fathers, so the wages don't decrease upon the parents return to work. This will also add a much healthier relationship between fathers and their children, and take the edge off of the average working class wife, who has to return to their job after giving birth, to realize her salary has just dropped compared to their coworkers.",1,0

Hence there are more men in these economies than women, and the men achieve higher, and better paying positions. Because they have the damn time to. It's not like a woman cant achieve fair pay, I think we are doing better than ever by far when it comes to equality of opportunity.

Why must we actively try to change the wage gap if it doesn't even determine how successful a woman can be? A solution could be to have more woman that don't have kids and dedicate lots of their time to work. The wage gap is essentially not even oppressive, but rather showing of how family systems tend to work.

So the gender pay gap is not a gender gap, but a talent gap. People who take career breaks for family reasons, who are not as nerdy/autistic and as a result achieve less and have less experience. In short they are less valuable in the business world and thus are paid less. People who are aggressive, obsessed about their career position, thick skinned, enjoy being manipulative with borderline socipathic tendancies do well in powerful very high paying, life dominating. management positons.

"We don't have a gender pay gap, we have a gender wage gap. When we say that there is no pay gap that means that in the United States men and women are paid the same, for instance if they're getting offered a job as a starting position at McDonald's or a teacher at a public school. It's illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, gender or any other condition. Men and women are being paid the same in all hourly paid jobs, but how much ~many~ men and women choose to work and how they work is the difference. Aside from women not even participating in certain strenuous industries (like construction or landscaping) where a lot of physical labor is required and there is a lot of money to be made, women are also not keen to do jobs that are high-paying and heavy in mathematics and sciences as proved by college degree acquisitions. Modern women have had access to college for decades now, and women are now the majority in college participation in the United States and yet women still steer clear from math and science degrees. The women are choosing that. Nobody is stopping women from getting that boring math calculus or rocket science class. These disparities are more than enough to account for the difference in how much the average woman and man earns in America. Now, specifically to this video, the most important issue is female psychology. The idea that women don't want to work in general. Many women may value their alone time and prefer to have down time. They may not want to work as many hours as men do. Not just for children, but for their own personal development. I know that not all women fit this archetype. In fact, the hardest working person I knew (that used to work everyday, two jobs) was a woman! So, there certainly are busy-bee women out there! That's not most women though. Most women don't want to be workaholics, and more men are prone to being workaholics. What I think is interesting is that even in this video we see this aspect, of women wanting to avoid work, playing out. In this video we see how the way to improve things would be to make things more flexible and that men should do more housework. In other words, this video is pandering to the people who want things to be made easier for them. Make things easier on me. It's too hard to work 8 hours a day. Make it 6 hours and give us more vacation and more money. This is exactly the attitude that I'm talking about when I say that many men and women simply don't want to work or are always looking to push their work away. A true mother wouldn't bemoan all the hours she spends caring for her children. A person that loves to work wouldn't be thinking about when the next time they get off is gonna come. We're talking about different psychologies here. This isn't even to do with women or men, because I've seen hardworking individuals on both sides and people who prefer doing recreational activities who are both males and females. It's just that our culture happens to promote female recreational attitudes a bit more. The reality is, under a free market, the hardworking people are going to outcompete and outclass the people who want more recreation. In general, that's the trade off that people who want more free time must make. More free time equals less money under equal circumstances. This video makes it look as if wanting free time or wanting more recreation is even desirable. Do you realize there are workaholics who NEVER take any vacations and who NEVER even have a day off and still have time to take care of their multiple kids, let alone 1 or 2 kids that the average female worker has? Let the workers work. Let the market give the job to the men and women who actually want to work, WITHOUT complaining.",1,0

Modern feminism would look at this and say that the college I worked for was sexist as me being a male earned more than my female counterpart. What they would overlook is the fact that I worked more over time and didn't take any of my earned holiday and so was compensated for it at the end of the month (I did this not because men work harder but because I had student debt to pay off). In this case I was on the exact same salary (about $14 an hour) and was contracted for 39 hours a week. This is a prime example of how the wages and earnings are two totally different things. You can be on the same salary but have different incomes depending on holidays taken and overtime worked. Its a shame feminism has gotten caught up in this hysterical, regressive liberal movement as feminism is one of the greatest triumphs of the 20th century",1,0

You can't close the wage gap. If you want to earn more as a woman don't have kids or make the man do more for your kid. You must be a dumb ass not figure that one out. Don't use the wage gap as a thing for argument sort your own wages and get a union fuckface,1,0

"Oh please, World Goverments, Internetional bodies like the UN, OECD, World Bank, and IMF, and Leading banks and Financial institutions all confirm the wage gap is real. Economists who have spent their entire lives studying the way gap and know a hell alot more about it than a ''resident scholar'' of a right-wing think tank and edgy teens who have never worked a day in their life. Another ignorant video. Even the first argument ''why don't firms only hire women?'' is a fallacy that totally ignores logistics, demographics and skill levels. Not to mention the OECD found even factoring in ''work choices, hours, leave, etc'' still leaves a nearly 5-10% wage gap. And forget off-the-books gender discrimination. Opening your eyes to the obvious conservative agenda being forced here.",1,0

"The main argument here is that the wage gap exists because women do more housework and childcare duties, therefore they can't focus on their careers as much as a man (who does less childcare and housework.) The problem with this is that it assumes women are forced into this role by the 'patriarchy' and they don't want to be the main childcare provider by their own choice... which is largely not true. Of course there are individual situations where it may be the case that the man wants to do more or equal childcare to the woman, and that couple is free to factor that into the way they situate their lives (which I'm sure does happen already), but by and large most women prefer to do more of the childcare and let the man do more of the bread-winning so they can spend their time with their child while they're growing up and less slaving away at work while the child is with a someone else... And both parents are doing this willingly as what they see as the best way to raise the child... And of course no one wants to do housework (generally speaking) but whoever is home more will obviously be the one to do more housework... in this case women are home more so they end up doing more. I'm a woman in a (thankfully) childless relationship with a man, and I make more, and therefore he does more housework and takes care of the animals, where as most of my coworkers (who are nearly all female mothers) prefer to work less and stay home with their kids like I described and I am an exception of sorts. _Also the single mom issue is a totally separate situation that wasn't addressed in this video and I will say that they tend to be royally screwed because they can't focus all their time on children OR on their careers, which is why a free to hire, government salary nanny would be a great thing to incorporate into the USA, basing it off of how it's done in France. That way the single moms pay wouldn't go right back into baby sitting while they're trying to make a profit on top of all their other bills and expenses that come with children._",1,0

The wage gap problem IS an Apples to Oranges issue, because its caused by forces (primarily) outside of the workplace, but we see its effects as the average wages between men and women. What Vox is trying to say is that to fix this inequality, we should approach it by giving women more opportunities to balance this extra demand placed on them, or some how alleviate it through policy, whether its better childcare, maternity and paternity leave to allow the father more time to help, or more flexible work hours. Its not about trying to pay women more to compensate, but by giving them the tools to be on an equal footing, which I think we can all agree with.",1,0

People saying it doesn't exist are wrong. It is definitely exaggerated though. Not to mention that all the statistics around this are outdated.

"poor families are two income families, while rich families are one income families, where usually, the man works 60 hours per week while the woman stays at home managing the household. and that's mostly because those women want that. if the relationship is new, and the guy loses his job and can't find a good one, and doesn't get a good income anymore, there's a big chance she will find another boyfriend ... that's how men are stimulated to put a lot of care into their career, the same way that women are stimulated to put a lot of care into their looks. what this means is that women from rich environments often choose not to work, while poor women often don't have that choice, and a result, a larger percentage of working women come from poor environments. THAT is the primary reason why men get payed more. it has absolutely nothing to do with men having more chances. the only places they might have more chances is in top business functions, sports or acting, or careers like that, where salary is entirely arbitrary, but this is only relevant to at most 2% of the population.",1,0
Thank you vox. for helping the cause focus on the real problem. It's not that companies are flat out sexist and don't pay women the same pay.

Now we have this ""wage gap"" myth that is splitting people apart, whereas before it was you either had a good paying job or a minimum wage job.",3,0

"Men try to earn a higher salary as a way to get a wife, this is obviously truer between the age of 20 and 35-40, when men are more likely to be looking for a wife. Then there's the fact that men are more likely to be relied on as a breadwinner (not sure that is a social privilege, to be honest) so they work longer hours, with less flexible and favourable conditions, and negotiate more aggressively for salary. Women don't generally prioritise work in the same way, so they n average earn less, very simple. There is no need to forcibly engineer society the way feminists want to see it. There is no wage gap, the proposed 'solutions' for it are almost invariably profoundly sexist and illiberal. Also - focusing on making hours flexible rather than on the quality of the end product/service sounds like a recipe for a failed company.",1,0

The women however get nothing. A man can apply for a government house if he is married but a woman cannot. He gets about 18000 dollars for getting married and they say it is to pay the dowry. So if he marries 4 wives which is STILL legal here than he would get 54000 dollars. And if he has 5 kids from each wife he would be a millionaire, i dont even want to calculate anymore.",1,0

Being completely positive would be nice in a puppies & sunshine world that we /don't/ live in. It would be good for her image but the truth is that *controversy* sparks people's interest. And that's what Freelee does. She speaks up, questions, calls people out on their bullshit, she /does shit/. Sitting back and making What I Eat in a Day videos is fine (I love those videos too) but veganism needs exposure. Most people aren't vegan not because they don't want to, but because they're clueless as to what's really happening. And Freelee plays an important role in just that; raising awareness. And since the YouTube community (and the world in general, if you ask me) is fueled by drama and controversy, that is exactly what she does, and she's pretty good at it. Say what you will, but she's authentic at the end of the day; she does what has to be done, and she's honest about it. Keep rocking.",1,0

Yeeeeeesh. educate yourself first bc you gotta at the very least understand the terms before you claim to identify. I support you exploring your gender identity and sexuality but please please please invest some time in educating yourself first!!

"Trish I think your view on who you think you might be is based on society's opinions. The reasons you think you might be a male are based on straight masculine men's opinion on you as a girl. That's the type you attract. And as for you being attracted to gay men, it could be an emotional thing. You enjoy having sex with anyone not matter their orientation but you might feel like you identify with a gay man because that's who you are attracted too. If you want a feminine boyfriend, they do exist. But the majority of men who are attracted to you seem to be masculine men. So you feel thats what you're ""stuck with"". And as for being penis envy, I am too girl. I think most women can agree that if they had a penis they would be happier. Because being a Cis male is easy and accepted, they can be dominant and assertive and be considered manly and thats ""normal"" and bonus points if you're a white cis man! Because they get everything handed to them. Being drag looks fun and exciting and they play dress up, and you're right, they don't always wear a face full of make up but it's their thing that they like to get all glam. That doesn't necessarily mean you identify with them you just have the same hobbies. I, am woman, love to put on cute pastel dresses (mostly cuz I hate pants lol) and wear make up but half the times I don't feel like taking the extra time to do all that.",2,0
"I haven't watched a video of hers in years, and I am NOT trying to make fun of her looks, but to me she looks seriously ill. Seriously, like she is on some insane drugs. Very sad.",5,1
oh no...this just ain't it. you shouldn't of even posted anything until you fully understood yourself and maybe talked to someone to clarify how and what you feel. what you're saying does not match up to the ‚Äúi'm transgender‚Äù there are many other genders. i think you maybe classify more as gender fluid. you said you don't want to be offensive but you basically making everyone who hates on trans n others believe they are all like this. you could of went about this so much better hun.,2,0

So I'm not hating I've been watching T since I could remember. But I really do not understand this. I have multiple friends that are trans. They want to be fully the gender they feel as they are. They will go to any length to be a guy or girl whoever they are. T has went through so many surgeries to get bigger breasts or an ass or a flatter stomach. It's all to give a girlish appearance. I've never had a friend who had purposely made themselves look at opposite gender especially having money. They had always tried to achieve to make themselves feel they when they do on the inside out.,3,0

"As a trans guy, this video is more than incredibly offensive. This is worse for the LGBT community than actual hate videos as her target audience WILL be roped into believing this bullshit.

The fact that she has to compensate of how shes still feminine by saying that since shes a ""gay man"" that we like more frilly things. I beleive that when it is a cis male. But when you are a transgender MALE you will want to pass as such. You wont want to look girly because being misgendered hurts. Trisha needs to get it throigh her thick skull that this is not okay. Being trans isnt dress up. Being trans is where your brain and body dont match up. Hers matches up just fine. This has me fuming. You arent trans if you dont have dysphoria.

"It's okay to be confused. I confused body dysmorphia for gender dysphoria and i was under the transgender label for two years. I was lost and didn't have answers to my questions. I am now happy and going by she/her (born gender) It's okay to be confused and try to find yourself. What's not okay is saying you are trans when you are 1000% comfortable with being the born gender you are. It's okay if you want to be T and you want to be more masculine however i dont think this is the right label. Now when you are finding yourself it's okay to go through things and see what fits and what doesn't but I would suggest making that a personal journey off camera and coming back when you find yourself. The trans community and the lgbt community in general get a lot of hate because people throw labels they know nothing about on themselves as a trend. Trans people are no longer valid in societies eyes because of ""transtrenders "" not saying what you are going through is a trend but it's something that takes more time and shouldn't be determined by the fact that you like gay men and you feel like you would be more respected if you had a penis. It's true you may not be just a cis women and i hope that you are able to find and love yourself because that's all anyone deserves. I don't think you should be hated but i don't think you should jump into this label either because it will only cause backlash for you and the trans community.

"This video is confusing, to say the least, but what she says makes some sense, if we look at this from a crossdreamer perspective. A lot of trans people live and present as their assigned gender, even if their real identity is trans or nonbinary. There are good and bad reasons for why they do so, but the fact that they are not transitioning does not make them less trans. Her frustration of being a gay man in a woman's body reflects the kind of pain many non-transitioning trans people feel. I guess some will dismiss the whole idea as preposterous, given her extreme femme appearance, but many trans people make desperate attempts at living up to the stereotypes, trying to fit in. Kirsten Beck was a bearded NAVY Seal, fighting in Afghanistan, before she gave up fighting herself. Moreover, characteristics like femme and butch are not restricted to one gender. After all, these were terms created in the lesbian community. I don't know if Trisha is trans, but she deserves the chance to find out for herself.",1,0

"I'd like to thank the vegan activists, educators, media producers, scientists, doctors, farm abuse activists, inventive cooks, and vegan product producers - I used to be one of those ignorant fools who thought you can't get enough protein/nutrients (seeing fat or malnourished vegans and thought the point was proven; they were just not doing it right). I ate abused/diseased meat without thinking of the savagery that farm animals face. The internet and the free flow of information is the greatest gift to humanity. It has enabled me to start making the switch and it's been pretty effortless. I don't feel any different really, as I've always had a pretty healthy diet, but I do know that plant protein sources have much more nutrients than meat, which only really provides proteins/B vitamins. However, it's comforting to know that my diet isn't destroying our home, Planet Earth. What makes me feel great is knowing I'm not a part of the torture of farm animals. I am no longer a part of a reason of their 24/7 agony, screams, torture, living completely hopeless lives of extreme suffering. Humans are the masters of the Earth. We should not be such disgraceful creatures and treat our home as if we're monkeys, flinging our feces everywhere. We should respect ourselves by respecting our home and be honorable, responsible stewards of Planet Earth.",3,0

"McDonald's is going to regret being so late to the changing diet. 2019 was a big year of change for me. I'm not vegan but I do eat 100% plants when I'm not around friends or family. I've been trying to do plant-based for about 6 months, with varying degrees of success. I had a few bad weeks and even a couple months where I just ate garbage. So my progress has been very slow. However, I still feel so much better than before I started. I've lost 28 pounds so far. I'm seriously at my high school weight! I'm still overweight but goodness, I never thought it was possible! This year, I'm going to be stricter with my friends and family. I've been making such excellent progress and I don't want to lose it because of them. I know they love me and all but they try to sabotage me at every opportunity despite knowing I'm trying to get healthy. I wasn't at all interested in fast food fake meats until recently. I finally realized that fake meats have one advantage over real meat - lack of hormones. No one eats fast food for health but if my friends are going to take me to these places anyway then I can at least get the healthiest option. I haven't been to KFC for years but I actually want to go just so I can try their vegan sandwich.

Thus she cannot be as good as her job as a man, and that is for every job that requires flexible hours, like business careers. Thus she gets paid as much as a man, given her achievements. This is very interesting. That being said, why is the conclusion ""We need jobs to be more flexible for women"" and not ""We need to balance housework between men and women""? How is it NORMAL for a woman to have more duties outside of her work than a man? Don't BOTH parents have as much responsibility towards their own children? Towards their own house?",2,0

"What's stupid about this video is that it only analyzes upper class jobs. Business sector jobs with $400,000 salaries are not at all representative of the wage gap. The wage gap exists because working class and middle class jobs of particularly male predominate labor have traditionally been unionized: steel workers, plumbers, electricians, factory operators. Traditionally female jobs have not, and they're almost all in the service sector. I'm sure there are some social sexist reasons for that. Ironically, as traditional masculine jobs are being outsourced abroad, both men and women are today left with low paying jobs without a history of unionization. That's a big reason why wages have been so stagnant for 30 years. I don't write the news folks I just report it.",2,0

Race plays an important part as well.,1,0
"every job i have had, men and women got paid the same wage, and yet i can create a wage gap very simply within that job. example: my wife and i work in the same job, doing the same hours and getting the same hourly wage. We both start the job at 20 years old and work until we retire. we don't have kids and both take the same days off. But my wife earns less than me. How? Retirement age - Men are forced to work for 2 years more than women (in the UK) even though women live longer. So even if i we get the exact same wage - it results in a pay gap. (the gap being the 2 years wages the man earns extra because he cant claim a pension at the same age) On top of that - paying a woman less than a man for the same job is against the law - so if the pay gap was this big then most women would be taking the employer to court and winning (which is very easy to do if this is the case) Focusing on the 'pay gap' in this way is useless and it does not actually look at problems with wages for both men and women . Paying the top person in a museum ¬£350,000 a year when the rest of the staff are volunteers is wrong, Political staff being given ¬£350 for travel an food each day when they only live 50 miles away is wrong. zero hours contracts so that people can be screwed over by the company they work for is wrong.

If you don't want kids and want to pursue your career go ahead then you will earn as much as your male colleagues",5,1

"Lmao to the people asking ""why not just hire women""... Have you been watching the video at all? If women make less money on average because of kids or other availability issues (which is what this suggests), then you would need to hire MORE women than you would have men and women combined just to get all the necessary work done. This video suggests that women who can commit as much time as men will make just about as much. Really, if you can split up the parenting load perfectly equally with your spouse and you two have worked the same job for the same amount of time, this evidence suggests the wage gap between you two will close.",2,0

"The 79 cent for every dollar a man makes has been debunked for DECADES. Women CHOOSE to go into lower paying fields than men. When you look at the top 10 paying fields of study at University, men DOMINATE 9 out of 10. There are a majority of women in only 1 field of study, and that's Pharmacology. (52% female 48% male...barely a majority) When you look at the bottom 10 paying fields, WOMEN dominate 9 out of 10 fields. Psychology, Sociology, Early childhood education, etc. Guess what folks? A petroleum engineer makes more than a kindergarten teach or a Social worker. This video also glosses over evolutionary differences between men and women and how we evolved. The gap exists in business more because men are more aggressive. Not only are they more likely to ask for a raise, but they are also more likely to push hard for sales. Women use different tactics, often looks and sexuality in business, specifically sales. I'll likely be called sexist for pointing out these facts, but feel free to research them yourselves and ask any questions. There IS a pay gap between men and women for doing the same job, but it's about 3%. Men also work an average of 3-4 hours more per week. So women work fewer hours, and tend to spend more time with their kids. Single women age 30-45 who don't have kids earn 7-8% more than their male counterparts. Why is this fact never discussed? The truth is that men and women go into different fields mainly because of evolutionary biology. It's why African Americans are only 12% of the population, but are 85% of the NBA. Is it racist to say that on average, a black man can jump higher and run faster than a white or Asian man? Or is this accepted because it is not a negative? Either way, it's a fact that cannot be disputed by science.",5,1

"cmon vox you're on the right track(ish) but what a terrible summary basically - wage gap isn't as black and white as people think it is. it's more that society is still aimed at women being primary caregivers and men being breadwinners so the opportunities they have are different - it's not a case of 'paying equal wage for same job/hours' because that's not the issue, the solution is to start having better procedures in place for maternity leave / less discrimination against females around the age they have kids / more men taking paternity leave etc you kinda touched on it a bit but i feel like you spent too much time going in-depth into the studies instead of talking about the theory of it (which is a pretty big part of the research itself)",2,0
"You do *not* want to close the wage gap. The reason you have it is because you are using an average in the calculation, which is not something you should ever do with a trinomial distribution. The average is based on the whole male and female population and does not take into account that you have three distinct different groups ""low income earners"", ""medium income earners"" and ""high income earners"". And you have a difference between the male and female demographics in these three groups! This is what causes the wage gap. For example (just to illustrate this). say that the low income is $40K AUD, the average wage in Oz is $80K AUD a year, an high income is $160K a year. We set that to be exactly the same for both men and women. Then we place 40% of women in low pay jobs, 40% or women in medium paid jobs and 20% in high pay jobs. For men we set 20% in low pay jobs, 50% in medium paid jobs and 30% in high paid jobs: Now we calculate the average: Women: 0.4 * 40K + 0.4 * 80K + 0.2 * 160K = $80,000 a year Men: 0.2 * 40K + 0.5 * 80K + 0.3 * 160K = $96,000 a year Wage gap: (80,000 / 96,000 = 0.83333.... : Difference 1.0 -0.83333 = 0.16666... so the wage gape is about 17% in this example. Note here that the wages are IDENTICAL for all men and women. The only thing that differs is the number of males and females in each group. So if you want to close this wage gap you can do that in 2 ways: 1) all people get the same wage irrespective of job. (this is communism and state controlled wage-setting) 2) We demand the same number of men and women in all jobs in society (this is again state control over who get to work where and again communism) We have over 100 years of data based on communism, it doesn't work and leads to tyranny. This is why we don't want to close the wage gap. because the way to do it tyrannical.",3,0

you think this is a godd explanation but there is ALOT of info you leave oute that idont know. 1. when you say men get 1 and wimmen get 0.79. but you need more info than that 1.edjucation like you state. 2. is this per houer or at the end of the year. then if men work 100 houers in a set time and wimmen work 79 houers i that same set time is this gap not fair. 2. now i dont know the stats but the fair way of paying someone is not by the houer but by the work so if men does more work in less time but work the same time as wimmen it is only logical that men gets more if they get more work done. same if wimmen does more wokr is the same time that men do then wimmen must get more. i wil only cal it equalety when someone can say that wimmen and men get the same kind of money for moving this bag of STUF from point a to point b no matter the time it takes you get a set amount of money when the work is done. this is fair. and until someone can say that men get more for the same job that took the same amount of time if they then get more then the system is not fair. then it is fair to pay the guy more if he does it faster depending on the job cus sometimes if you does something a litle slower take your workd and deliver it to someone that then have to do work on it. the slower eatch point in the cahain is the slower the total work is done.,2,0

Women actually occupy most of the median jobs in society, and yes a big reason for the wage gap is that men ask for raises more than women, but if you look at the statistics men are significantly FIRED more than women because they take those risks. Additionaly there is biology to consider. Successful men will almost always have options to female partners, while unsuccessful men will have much less.

As you mentioned about the job of a pharmacist, you should that women earned 92% of what men did, where is the other 8%? as you mentioned that now there are more flexible hours and she can work on hours suitable, so the variable of a kid is gone whether a woman has a kid or not, so in theory, according to you the wage gap should not exist between pharmacists, but it does. so what could possibly be the reason of the missing 8%? Another thing, in the statistics you showed about different types of jobs (tech, business and one other) it is true that tech has a shrinked up wage gap, but I most certainly saw some green dots on the middle range too. if a woman is doing her job (completing experiments and whatever else is done on labs) then why are there some positions in the tech itself that have an existing wage gap? Now going on to the study of MBA students (the one between 1996 and 2006), now this time most variables are same, the women have the exact same qualifications as the men and is most cases even the same age as men. so now tell me, even after that why are woman paid 15000 less than men? Yes, the wage gap is considerably less in this scenario, and that is really great but why is there a difference at all? This all is regardless whether a woman has a kid or not, or even married. After all, you showed us the statistics of difference of wage gap between ""woman who have kids and woman who do not"" agreed that there was a considerable difference but then again, the column of ""women who do not have kids"" was not zero, why not? this time there is clear indication that having kids is not the prime reason of women being paid less than men so my final question is, if this is clearly not the prime reason, then what is?",2,0

"Why does it seem there aren't 'enough' females in CEO positions etc? Let me explain simply. In the work place if you want to get to the highest position possible you HAVE to make sacrifices. You cannot have everything your way it's IMPOSSIBLE. You have to begin to work EXTREMELY long hours to get to the top which means you SACRIFICE your free time, family time etc. Males are more willing to do this than females in general. Males don't have it all so why do feminists think they can? Males have to sacrifice their family time and free time etc because they may be travelling around the world a lot as part of their job. Women are natural caregivers, and most females (in general) want to start a family because they have a limited of time to have babies! Women typically want more balance in their life, they don't want to be juggling a high profile job, family life and other responsibilities. Think about it, that's ALOT of work for one person - especially considering how much work you need to put in if you have to RAISE a family. It isn't easy for females because they're natural caregivers and they typically tend to be more involved with family anyway - for example looking after the children, taking them to school etc, feeding them etc. Hence why, women take on more part time roles and hence why the gender wage gap statistics are misleading! If you work part time you earn less than a full time worker - FACT. Women were actually happier in the 1950's because they didn't have the responsibilities of having to work high profile jobs, look after the home, look after the kids like more women may be experiencing today. Furthermore, another reason that explains why there aren't more women in high profile positions is because of competitiveness and personality. Females are competing not only with females but males too. Males are naturally and evolutionary more competitive (due to their natural dominant traits), so having to compete with other females and other males isn't exactly easy. Females typically have an agreeable personality unlike males (in general). What this means is females are less likely to disagree with something and be vocal about it (in general). If females want to succeed in these types of environments and get promoted/earn more money they MUST take on these male traits: competitiveness and dominance. Women must sacrifice a portion of their femininity in order to gain equality of outcome. Just like men would have to sacrifice their masculinity (otherwise known as toxic masculinity to Feminist SJWs) in order to create equality of outcome (desired by feminists). Feminists don't understand that having both a mother and father in a high profile job that requires lots of working hours, requires time away from their kids. Who's lives are gonna get affected? THE KIDS. They are missing out on family time and it's going to affect how they are raised because their parents MAY be too busy working to give them attention and the care - thus potentially resulting in the children to grow up unnaturally independent and not unattached to their parents (distant). To conclude, I'm generalising here. So don't comment saying 'I can manage' because you're a minority, which I acknowledge hence why I said in general.",5,1

"If a woman doesn't like the idea of taking the time and energy (and making the sacrifices) to raise her own kids, why have them? If it happens, anyway, there are so many couples would happily take and raise them that there is no problem there! But if she has bought into the idea that she must ""have it all"" or else she must resent all men, and if making as much, or more, money as her husband is more important, then pay someone else to raise them - or ME (and I mention the husband, because the video does). Daycare workers will NEVER love or treat those children like their own, and they come and go, so the sense of abandonment starts young, and telling them they ""shouldn't"" feel it is about the adults' feelings, not theirs. Ever heard ""the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world""? In case you need that spelled out, it means that the person who spends the most time with and talking to/guiding children is the one who actually ""raises"" them (not the one who simply houses them, pays the bills, eats dinner with them - if even that, and gives the biggest gifts). He or she develops the closest relationship and passes on THEIR values and beliefs and, thus, naturally has the greatest influence on what the kids will do with their lives - thus THAT person becomes ""the hand."" I'm old enough to have seen many, many outcomes of both ways (and there's no going back or ""do-overs,"" and no amount of ""sorry's"" change things). So we made the choice to be the ones to love and raise ours and I'd be that ""hand"" who was there, knowing the financial challenges, and I am SO glad we did! It was worth every struggle, and that's what I tell them - ""You are worth more than any amount of money I could have made."" Yes, kids raised by others usually still love their parents, but when talking with them many wistfully, and with repressed guilt, say they wish they could have had something like what we did for ours, but that they'd NEVER tell their Mom because it would just make her feel bad, so they carry the painful burden quietly. Kids have enough pain in this world, so why add to it if it's for a point of pride for the philosophy, a choice, to be financially richer and have more ""stuff"" - at their expense? My boss and co-workers would not remember me long after I am gone, would not likely be there for me when I am old and feeble and need help, or visit me regularly if I am in hospital, send cards, call or text, or put flowers on my grave. I'd NEVER imagine being a stereotypical passive-aggressive ""guilt Mom"" who overtly or subtly makes them feel bad for ""holding me back and being the reason I couldn't achieve my feminist dream.""

I had been under the impression that the gap is a myth, but was looking to hear other explanations as to why it persists. All I learned from watching this video is that its creators seem to take issue with the fact that women have CHOICES, and that they CHOOSE different paths in life that men do not (and in some cases, CANNOT). This is why I can't support modern Feminism as it is most often expressed in the mainstream: it's a bunch of women shaming men for being men, and shaming women for daring not to devote themselves to the corporate rat race and instead choosing to focus on their homes and families. Feminists have created deep confusion and unhappiness in several generations of men and women, but ESPECIALLY women, who I am finding feel increasingly pressured to ""achieve"" while at the same time being keenly aware that their youth and fertility are slipping away. Those that DO have children feel guilty and ashamed for being away from their children in order to work, while simultaneously feeling RESENTMENT that they are spending the bulk of their time caring for another human being and staying at home. With each passing day I grow more and more disillusioned with Feminism, because I see the misery and internal conflict it is causing CONSTANTLY. I've come to the conclusion that Feminists only care about THEMSELVES, they care about being SEEN to ""fight for a cause"", they care about proselytizing and spreading their Feminist faith to the masses.

"The whole thing about the wage gap is that it's talking about averages. To examine an actual salary gap, you have to look at it in specific fields, not across all mediums, because it's very clear that if you just average out yearly earnings and divide one by the other you're going to get a very general image of reality. The truth is, while men have been encouraged to pursue wealth and success for themselves for decades (if not centuries), the same incentive wasn't true for women, at least for a long time if not still, and because of that, many more women turn out to be stay-at-home parents or settle for small jobs. Less women in STEM fields, less women in big businesses, less women in big roles, not ONLY because of a structurally sexist academic and professional universe, but also because of it. I'm sure there would be some difference, most likely very significant, if you were to compare a man and a woman in similar roles within the same company or across an entire field of work, but it probably wouldn't be as latent as the wage gap we've grown accustomed to.",2,0

Wait it compares the median wage not the mean? That's moronic! The median is just the Middle number value out of a large sample size. It is not useful in comparing statistically the wages of men and women as it either underselling or overselling the differences because of it. The median doesn't take any factors into account of the study sample and is just lazy to use.,3,0
"She is right about one thing. Women do work less than men due to children and stuff buts thats only natural. If you look at it, men would face the same thing if they took more of a house husband role too. So the wage gap is basically created because women just take care of children more.",2,0

Before i accept this video at face value, i would like to see the same study for women without children, and see if the wage gap still exists there. If it does, your video might need some rethinking If it does not, your video is legit And make sure the ages of the childless women are about the same as the ages of the women with children, or the conservative side will argue that women tend to work harder at an earlier age, and that the earlier aged men slack off more than their older counterparts Have to have all bases covered",2,0

"When will this bs die off? The differences are not existent when you take someone in the same profession, working in the same part of the world (to eliminate regional differences in pay and labors laws). The feministics twist this truth to suit them by combining the earnings of all men and women without regard for age, profession or any other factors. Obviously an Engineer is going to earn more than a Teacher and a Doctor is going to earn more than them. That's just how it is. Considering the fields men and women work in due to their own interests and dreams, we find that women tend to work as teachers, nurses, etc which are not very high paying jobs but come with a social component and are much lighter on the workload. Men tend to take more stressful AND dangerous jobs - ranging from mining, sewage, engineering, off-shore work and more. They are obviously much more strenuous and dangerous to one's life and limb but are crucial for civilization to function hence their pay is equally large. By explicitly avoid this piece of common sense, these feminists are peddling lies openly and people still buy it. It's annoys me to no end that people are not using their brains even a little bit. If you paid a Doctor only as much as a regular office worker, why would anyone go through the years long hell and massive risk to be a Doctor? Same with Engineers, miners and so on.",3,0

I believe these statements to be true based on what I've observed and if they are true than it is obvious women have a disadvantage when it comes to having a business career leading to a wage gap. It may not be true in your specific field but it is true in a general sense and we should work towards fixing it where we can.",1,0

Only having one woman bringing in money for all three of us, let alone our bills (we also have a decently sized, 2 story house), doesn't sustain us enough, and sometimes results in money being tight.

Kennedy passed a law that stated that, with the exception of raises, it is illegal to pay anyone less or more than any other for the same amount of work, in the same profession, at the same workplace.

Plus at their 40s and 50s women go through menopause which studies done by women asking other women have shown that menopause reduces their productivity in the work place. If you hire a 30 year old man for 25 years, you get 25 good years of work. If you hire a 30 year old woman for 25 years, assuming she has 2 kids you get 24 1/2 years of work plus you get 10 months to 4 years of sub par menopause work. Hiring women is bad business.",5,1

"There are many wayst o solve this 'wage gap problem' (I personally don't see it as a problem so long as earnings per hour is the same). These mannerisms are all purely social, and it boils down to undemonizing men and fathers as incompitent. Holliwood loves to show the mother as the 'does everything' and the men as 'unparenting'. And if they are a good parent they are A) divorced B) mother died, or C) learning. The mother is always more compitent in shows and movies in parenting. This provides a social stigma that if there is a child in the family, the man isn't the main influence, it's the woman. This makes bosses in the business district highly uneasy with giving women promotions to jobs that require heavier hours or more rigorous work when they are pregnant as they will also have the burden of their children now. Another example is that in a core family ideal, it is the man who does the work and the woman who stays home, now when this ideal shifts it's interesting to see how people react. If both parents are working, they're both valued and putting money on the table. If the father is working and the mother is not, it's considered a normal basic family. If the mother is working and the father is taking care of the house, he is often considered a leech and a deadbeat. Thus the men, in order to avoid social hatred from peers and so on, ALWAYS gets a job. Or at least ,most men will try to get a job. A woman on the other hand doesn't always need a job to be considered acceptable or normal. (A very huge example of this is in the military, there is a large amount of males in there in a stable, secure, and well paying job while a large amount of women associated with the army happen to just be 'house wives' without much of a job. Stastically, this forces the 'wage gap' to be in men's favor since they are socially required to be employeed or they're considered practically on the same boat as criminals and meth heads. Finally, this wage gap will probably never be fixed because of that earlier detail I mentioned. The military is a dangerous job, as well as lots of other jobs. It's clear that men favor or do not mind dangerous jobs that could result in injury or death while women on the other hand do not favor those jobs. Dangerous jobs pay more.",3,0

"If two people have the same demand from other workplaces, same experience, same education, same grades, same connections and in every single way are identical to the workplace then they should get the same salary per hour. That's simple. The wage gap, in many cases (if not most), comes because women value family time and social time higher than men do. They also, on average, have more sick days than men do. Then you have the whole ""baby making period"" in the 20-40 year period for women... If a man and a woman started out, fresh out of university, at the same job and same salary the statistics tell us that a man will sacrifice family time and social life to work more. All these extra hours give more experience, more connections and you'll be more in demand by workplaces because of that. In return that gives you a higher salary. Likewise a ""career woman"" that did all the same sacrifices that the man did will be similarly payed for their experience, however another difference in men and women also determines their salaries and that's how much they demand. A man will typically not be afraid of conflicts or stress in salary negotiations, where as a woman will typically fold earlier and get a lower salary. Why? Because men are psychologically ""plugged"" or trained/influenced while growing up that ""men don't quit"" and women ""you have to sit pretty"". Is it right or wrong? Neither. Each and everyone has their life to control, if you want a career and rise to the top you have to sacrifice something. If you want a family and time for kids and a lot of friends then you have to sacrifice something else. Biologically and psychologically we're predisposed to certain things, as a man I would love to be a ""stay at home dad"" and take care of the kids, house and things like that. However I work in education, which also satisfy my desire to be around kids and teach. With that comes many different advantages and disadvantages. Just like other types of work or lifestyles do. Point is that everyone needs to stop looking to blame others for their own shortcomings or sacrifices. Money isn't the only thing wealth can be measured in, some 50 year old man or woman that sacrificed family and friends in order to build their career might have money but they don't have the same social life or family bonds. Again, you pick what you want ...don't blame anyone else for that.",5,1

Women have equal opportunity in modernised countries, which means that they are free to pursue the same careers that men do.

It's a result of a personal decision from a woman, and if it's problem, then more women should be transferring to the higher risk jobs that men dominate (through fair process, not discrimination) and closing that gap. We don't need to look into the 'wage gap' because there is no difference in women's earning for the same job. There is no discrimination in this gap between incomes, and therefore it isn't an issue. This isn't a feminist argument, this is a study of the choices women make, and they make those choices, not because of some form of oppression or patriarchy, but because they have the freedom to choose their job, and less women choose high risk, high paying jobs. It doesn't prove anything other than that. I'm not saying people can't research it, it's quite interesting to observe human choices, but I'm saying that this can never be used to advocate a feminist issue, because the way it is misrepresented over and over again makes it sound like one, and anyone who uses it as such is either intellectually dishonest or retarded.",3,0

"I thought that this would debunk the wage gap as what it really is, being an earnings gap. The earnings gap states that overall women make less than men with roughly 77 cents to a dollar being the figure that they come up with. This is statistically true, since on average, most studies on the subject have shown that men more often ask for raises, apply for the highest paying jobs (ie.. STEM), tend to go into overtime more often, and that men aren't biologically capable of having children. As such men tend to work longer hours, and with the same pay, earn more. Women on the other hand, have all of these obstacles to overcome if they are to work for the same time and earn as much. The icing on the cake, is that the pay gap has been made illegal, therefore all companies who do this are to go to federal prison. As such, there wouldn't be a pay gap anywhere in the United States.

It's funny how VOX admits that the argument is total bull at the very beginning of the video. They admit that the wage gap is based on nothing but median wages of both men and women. Do you understand what that means? That is the average of all female wages compare to all male wages. It has nothing to do with females making less money for their time at the same job as a man. It only means men spend more time working on average. Men tend to get pregnant at a far lower rate than women. Men tend to work more over time than women statistically. Men are more likely to do high risk jobs that have high pay. Men are less likely to work minimum wage low skill jobs than women. Men are more likely to work night shift jobs than women. Men are more likely to do physical jobs than women. Men are more likely to pursue lucrative college degrees than women. Men are more likely to own a business than women. Men are more likely to do dirty jobs than women. Men are more likely to stay with the same company for long periods of time than women. NOT FOR DOING THE SAME JOBS! These are just a few of the examples of why if you compare the totals men make more than women. After all if a company could get away with paying women 25% less than men. They would only hire women.,3,0
"are we just going to say that women get paid less than men even though in 147 out of 150 of the wealthiest cities in America women make an average of 8 percent more than men?

I am a full time student and work full time. I have tried to go vegetarian/ vegan so many times but i find myself reverting back to my old ways due to lack of time to really prepare my meals.

I've mentioned that I was a vegan and have been told to kill myself when I wasn't being rude or telling anyone to change at all. People hate me because of vegan extremists. They think ALL vegans are extremists. I'm aware that if I get any replies to this comment they will probably be incredibly negative from both vegans and omnivores.

I was wondering if you had any tips for going vegan even when everyone around you eats meat. I naturally have never been obsessed over meat tbh like I never found the tastiness about it so that is not really what my problem is, my problem is that my parents will not buy the large amounts of fruit that I need for the Raw till 4 diet that I really want to get to.

"I just watched the ""from farm to fridge"" video and I'm so disturbed and upset by it.

I have still continued to eat other meats and dairy products but after seeing that I am seriously considering cutting all of that out of my diet. Freelee I think you spreading awareness like this is awesome and inspiring and I'm so glad that you come on here and present people with the harsh truth of the unethical treatment of these animals!

"freelee, will you do a video about Emily skye? she is also an aussie, very famous on social media and recently on a magazine. she recommends a diet of mostly chicken and steamed vegetables though, and says that she has a very sensitive tummy. Maybe raw till 4 will help her digestion? she is already fit looking and very sweet but I think she is a huge influence on many girls, and the whole white chicken is healthy myth is just being reaffirmed. thanks!",1,0

"I'm considering going vegan but I need some advice. There is something which has prevented me from becoming vegan. Ever since I was little I've been naturally skinny. It's very easy for me to lose weight, so I have to be careful not to skip meals or else my bmi will drop down too low. Either I have a very high metabolism or maybe I have some sort of issue with absorbing fat. I have unresolved digestive issues as well. But anyway, it makes me feel like I need that extra fat in my diet that's in meat and dairy, as ""unhealthy"" as it is. I'm worried that if I go on a plant-based diet I'll lose weight like all of the vegans seem to. I really can't afford to lose weight. Should I be worried about a vegan diet?",1,0

If you were able to say thoes words without feeling dysphoric, hate to say it but YOU'RE NOT TRANSGENDER! You're just an sjw that is in it for the fame and money because you get paid to make these videos. That means you're basically using the Lgbtq (trans) community for money and your own comfort. We fought long and hard for our spot today! We get harassed and bullied for being who we are, some of us even commit sucide because we don't feel comfortable in our body. This is really fucked up of you. If you were trans and had the freedom to transition you would have done it by now. Quit the bullshit and stop making the trans community look stupid.",6,1

"Coming from a trans man: this isn't how it fucking works, Trish. You need gender dysphoria to be trans. Gender dysphoria is feeling a disconnect and discomfort in your biological gender's body, and you clearly don't have that issue. Trans men can be gay, yes. Trans men can like makeup and fashion, yes. But trans men absolutely do not want to be seen as a female?? That's against everything we stand for and have to go through. This shit isn't a joke, Trish. Being trans isn't something you randomly use as an excuse for not liking straight men, or for feeling insecure about being called a bitch because you are assertive. You are one of the reasons people outside of the community see us as a JOKE. I hope this is either a shitty joke that you somehow thought would be funny, or that people realize this isn't how being ftm works.",5,1

Okay listen. She or He it's whatever the LGBTQ is about love and loving all no matter how you feel. Just because she or he doesn't know the correct terms for what she or he is trying to say doesn't change the fact on how she or he feels. This is how she or he feels and that's fine and we should all love that no matter what. Also with what she or he are saying about the difference between male and female is wrong. Just bc a guy wears makeup dont make him gay and viceversa. So what she's saying is wrong but maybe she doesn't know how to put it yet and that's okay so stop saying all this shit when you have no clue how hard it is to do what she is doing I mean posting it and saying how she or he feels.,1,0

Not only is that incredibly discouraging and insulting to nonbinary/genderfluid trans people, its a giant F U to people living with schizophrenia.

"The introduction to this video alone hit me really, really fucking hard. I was a tomboy as a kid, got teased for it, and felt a lot of pressure to be hyperfeminine as I got older. It took me years to realize that as much as I loved *being good at being feminine*, I didn't like how I looked. Literally everything you're saying, about penis envy, about how I felt a struggle between wanting to be a ""good feminist"" or a better, stronger woman, and this nagging idea that I was actually a guy. It felt like a betrayal for me to give up my identity as a woman, but now that I'm three and a half years on testosterone, I know that my body is meant to have T in it. Kicking gender norms to the curb and escaping the conforms of what society tells you that you have to be, being a gender nonconforming man, choosing to forgo hormones or getting hormones and surgery, all of those are perfectly reasonable. You don't have to go hypermasculine to be a gay trans man. Hell, you could date other gay trans men! But at any rate, you're absolutely welcome here, you're not ""faking being trans.""

She needs to go see a therapist or something and get this figured out before spreading it on social media.

"Trisha, or T, or any name you decide to use, I don't know where to start with this video. I, myself am a gay, transgender male. The huge thing with being transgender, is the want for more masculinity than feminism. I like to present myself as a male, dress as a male, be called a male, seen as a male, nothing else, not my birth gender. I have dysphoria, causing me to dislike my chest, my genital, and anything that makes me look or seem more like a female. All true transgender males have dysphoria and discomfort. With being a transgender male, you do not identify with being a girl the birth gender. You want masculinity. You want to be seen as a girl. I honestly believe you are a little confused and questioning. Look into being gender fluid. Gender fluid is when some days you love to present yourself as a male, then some as a female. People who are gender fluid us he/him and she/her pronouns most often, meaning you don't have to use They/Them pronouns. Please, just look into it. ( Also, a lot of the stuff in your video is very offensive. You say you don't like labels, yet you're using them. Gay males are perceived as galled up and feminine in a way, but most aren't that way. Also, saying you believe you're transgender due to loving short hair, not having to tend to it, girls and others can feel the same. Also, when you say straight men turn you off, that is so darn weird. You automatically aren't attracted to a male because they're not gay, that's almost like being transexual, only liking and wanting to date trans men and women. It's just really strange and I don't agree with judging someone on their sexuality. It's almost heterophobia )",3,0
"This probably won't get seen but Trisha I can relate. I've always felt more comfortable around men, have always had more male friends than female, have always been told I have a strong masculine energy, and I've always thought my personality would've been better in a mans body. I don't believe these factors make someone transgender. They are absolutely real and valid feelings, but I think you are still Trisha, you're just moulding that person into who you think others want her to be. You need to be you regardless of what is between your legs‚ù§Ô∏è",2,0

Trisha has been needing serious psychological help , the back lash she will/has received from that video is going to change her life forever.

"Just because you dress up as a male from a musical does not make you transgender. Also, I wouldn't refer to anything or anyone as 'Girly' because that's not really the correct term. I'd say feminine, and yes, Trisha is very feminine and presents feminine. Identifying with males is a TOTALLY different thing, identifying AS a male is a whole nother thing. my question is if you are an adult now and can do what you want then why are you not attempting to somewhat pass? Another thing is, because you are a straight female, you are going to be attracted to gay dudes, because YOU. Are. Straight. That does not make you trans because they're gay. You have to have this thing called Gender Dysphoria, something that all trans people have, and you wouldn't definitely not even want to mention your chest if you actually had it because it's a very overwhelming topic for transgender people. I should now, because I am trans! And also, your gender identity and sexuality is not a choice, just like the natural color of your eyes and skin, you didn't choose that.",3,0

"Ummmm no. You're basically saying that not wanting to put on makeup and not wanting to do your hair in the morning means you're a boy and you're transgender.... you don't like the association with being a female because with being a female comes with all the standards and expectations that media has put upon us. You don't like how you feel when you don't meet those hypothetical standards and people make comments and because men don't have that same problem as women, you're trying to say you're a man.

"I love animals, I have kept many animals as pets during my life, dogs, cats, canaries, parrots, fish, everything you can think of. But, going vegan is also killing animals indirectly. What do you think will happen to the domestic animal breeds, such as sheep, cows, chicken, and to a lesser extent pigs and goats? I am not judging you or saying that you are wrong for not eating meat, it's your choice, I am just stating facts. The current way of keeping domestic animals is cruel, and it should be changed, but eliminating meat from the diet of people is not the answer. People don't eat dogs, yet dogs suffer much more than farm animals. To see what I am talking about, I will give you an example: I am mostly a catch and release fisherman, but also I keep some fish. You might say it's cruel, but I am contributing for the fish population much more than you, who aren't fishing or eating fish. I pay a daily fee, which is not cheap, to fish.The law is that most of that money goes to fish stocking, which means that thousands of fish are bred and released every year because of me, and people like me. So who is the real contributor to the wild waters here?? Me or you? 3 fish (that is the daily limit on trout fishing) are humanely killed to feed me, and hundreds are released due to me.",2,0

"Keto blogger the very configuration of our teeth shows that we did not evolve as carnivorous. Our canines are rounded, the molars larger than carnivorous. That's all about how food is processed in our mouth. The fact that food is gulped today is contrary to the feature of chewing the food to mix with the digestive fluids and only then swallow. The fact that it's not done today does not validate appalling habits. Everything that animals go through from birth before being gulped by humans is reflected in the ensuing result - obesity, digestive problems, cancers, anger, fear, pain, overdose antibiotics, contaminated grains which flow in to us! Nature provides us with everything we need to eat and cure us. Everything! Bible punching creeps hide behind God to justify our disgraceful actions. The planet is reeling. Our lack of civilization is at war with progress which is also running rampant. AI which the great majority ignore is at our doorstep. This present social disorder is not serving or protecting us. Ask yourselves if corporations will use them, they in turn will not pay taxes. So why must we pay taxes? Why must we pay for irrational wars? Why must we pay for AI who will take us over? I mention all this because it all comes down to the vagrancies of the rich. Animals are the mana for the food industry which is killing us and damaging the planet. The food revolution takes us back to basics. Health sanity, compassion, ethics, love. This will help save us. We need to upgrade our civilization status. Food is our sanity and health!

Beyond meat is just an opportunistic enterprise getting rich by riding the wave of this new trend. They don't bring any value to the people. I bet that in the future all this new type of junk food will be classified as unhealthy. Educate the people. Make them fell better and healthier and they will stop eating animals on their own accord.

Fear based ""motivation"" is never as good as showing the benefits of change. The first 10-15 minutes of gloom and doom extreme ""activists"" and the sad, mad little icon of the hour Greta are a big turn off to me and most people I know. Do you fly to the many conferences around the world you attend? If, like the environmentalist said, we have had 5 previous environmental extremes that wipe out some species, obviously they happened before coal, planes, trains, automobiles and factory farming existed then who are we to be so egotistical to think we as humans are so significant our action or non action is going to stop the 6th?

"The planet is going to end whether we become vegan or not, foolish thinking lol. If you believe in God you'll believe that it will end because he says it will. If not then you'll foolishly think mere human efforts will be able to eternally sustain and save a planet that was doomed from the beginning. You can't save something you didn't create, foolish. We can't even save ourselves from dying, foolish. We're subject to death and dying just like the earth eventually will be. Nothing lasts forever on this planet so why would the planet last forever. Foolish ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. That's not saying not to watch what you eat but the world is destined to wax worse and worse. What shall mere food consumption within humans do against the hand of the Lord? Shall his will not come to pass because of mans plan to ‚Äúsave the planet‚Äù? This is so similar to the Tower of Babel event within the Bible. With mere human effort they desired to build a tower that reached heaven, and tried and failed to launch attacks on God. Read the Book of Jasher, Chapter 9. Don't you know that that arrogant plan failed? We really think we can save the world but we in America alone don't even acknowledge God as God? Instead turn to God, for world destruction under the Lords hand is soon to arrive and those who endure, abide in Him and hide under his wing shall be saved.",3,0

Believe me being a Vegan is terrific. The cuisine is unlimited. Never ending options and all superb. The fulcral part for me are THE ANIMALS!

The planet and our lives will begin a new reform and bring us a lifestyle which promotes the best in us.,1,0
I hate industrial farming it's pure horror. But we are designed to eat meat but in a more humane way. Respectful and sustainable hunting. Being vegan wouldn't be possible without modern society such as b12 supplements or a mass of different fruits and veg being imported around the world to countries where it is not native. Hugh carbon footprint. Being vegan is being promoted despite it's long term health issues because it is about control. You can't survive being vegan unless you rely on the system. You go off grid or be self sufficient you would die. Therefore is it not natural.,3,0

(By the way, chances are that sauce on your steak was probably plant based, or at very least had more plant based ingredients than animal based ingredients.)

"19:36 this man sends quite an unhealthy message out to all meat eaters like me. I have given up eating conventionally raised meats from the butcher like he's doing years ago. I'm well into my 50's, an all natural competition bodybuilder for 30 years and animal protein is the single greatest ingredient to my diet. Organic grass fed beef is loaded with CLAs and it's proven to IMPROVE your health. All free roaming animals like elk, bison, deer provide us witth extremely healthy meats chocked full of those CLAs. Heart... HEALTHY. Wild caught fish...?? Has no one ever read studies that PROVE how heathy for your heart it is to eat that.??? This vegan movement is out of control. 1.5% of the world population is vegan. That's under 2 million people out of 7.7 BILLION total people in the world. A tiny flock that squawks mighty loudly. ‚ÄúIt's a carcass‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt has eyes and lungs‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt has a mother‚Äù. ‚ÄúCow farts are going to cause the earth to incinerate‚Äù. This video like all vegan ones is all shock and awe. Scare tactics and that clear vs cloudy blood in a test tube.?? Well played out. I'm confident that my blood isn't cloudy like that implies. I eat all of that delicious, nutritionally dense food that is presented in all of these vegan videos ALONG with those healthy SUPPORTING meats and fish that I mentioned but I make sure to steer clear of every one of those ‚ÄúVegan meat substitute‚Äù processed food junk products. Good luck standing next to me on stage at my next lifetime all natural bodybuilding competition full of soy products and quinoa and blueberries . ü§úüèºüí•ü§õüèº It's not hard to be thin and really lean like a tennis player or runner but to have the muscle density that I possess at my age you need to be on juice.",3,0

"The main focus should be around peoples' health, everyone wants to be healthy! On the other hand the majority of people don't care about the environment when they eat. Bottom line, most people are selfish and don't give a !@%^ about anyone or anything that is not related to them. Process vegan food is not health promoting and being vegan is not the answer to optimal health, whole foods free of chemicals and minimally process are the key, most restaurants and chefs are all about how to deliver chemicals throughout food; if you want to eat rice, boiled it in water and eat it! Stop falling into the artificial stimulation produced by the saturation and processing of food throughout added chemicals. We are not carnivores neither omnivores, otherwise meat would be perfect and wouldn't cause any problem whatsoever. The main objection of people to make a change in diet is the fear of missing the food they think they love, but the reality is than they can't taste good food because they are saturated and their senses aren't sensible enough after a terrible diet. Our taste improves dramatically over time after adopting a health promoting diet free of salty animal products, sugar, and oil; find a way to demonstrate to people that they will not only be healthier, but they will enjoy food like never before and realize that is nothing like sitting on the couch watching TV with the mind empty, healthy people are more energetic and enthusiastic about food and that shows that is not the end of your happiness, it's the beginning!!!!",2,0

The study states that 84% of the wage gap of MBA's is a result of differences in MBA courses taken and GPA, differences in career interpretations, and weekly hours worked. That reduces the wage game to 95%. A direct quote from the study: Fifteen years after obtaining their BA, women who earned an MBA had the lowest labor force participate rate, the lowest share working full time and full year, and took the greatest amount of (non-educational) time off from employment compared with others having professional degrees and PHD's.

Someone who works only 32 hours a week will always take home less than someone who works 40+ hours a week. Amount of years with employers who give annual raises also effect earnings. In companies that don't automatically give yearly raises and where a person has to ask for a raise if you don't ask you only have yourself to blame for not getting a raise. 4.

There needs to be flexibility to account for the variety of working decisions woman make throughout their career.

We have to get girls visualising themselves succeeding in male dominated roles.

"Talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point, because even the concept ""Equal pay for equal work"", built into law, violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation. Namely, if I, due to my personal preferences, want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman, that is my personal choice. It's my money and I have the right to do what I want with it. If I prefer working with men more then with women, and thus, pay a man more than a woman for equal work, no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money. It is MY money. But the government does. It forces me to pay them equally. It forces me to give my own money to someone although I entered no legally-binding relationship with that person, but is all based on the ideological concept of 'equality'. Given the fact that lawmaker's ideological concept, be it equality or whatever, cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person, basing the laws on the concept ""Equal pay for equal work"" is a due process violation.",3,0

If men were able to say rearrange their tues and thurs schedules to make sure THEY were the ones to pick up the kids from school and take them to soccer practice and make dinner, then the woman would only have to rearrange mon, wed, fri.

"I think we should all keep in mind that it's also more difficult for women to get into higher paid jobs than it is for men. Not necessarily for lack of willingness, though fewer women seek out certain jobs than men, but from labour work to high-paid management positions males are more likely to be chosen by employers out of an equal pool of prospective employees, and even sometimes when a woman has greater qualifications. It's a similar problem to how fewer African-Americans gain employment even when race ratio and education is equal across candidates. I don't know if it's just something society will grow out of or if something needs to be done to break the cycle of unequal opportunity/unequal selection. Here in Australia it's not too bad given that state education is easily accessible and puts most kids on equal footing as far as modern education goes, but still countless Indigenous families can't get their kids the same opportunities because its so much harder for them to get a job, due to discrimination (there's still a widespread perception of Aboriginals as welfare leeches and drug addicts that prevents them from finding work), and in turn their children end up in a similar situation being unable to provide equal opportunity to their own families. My point is it's not always choice that creates earnings gaps between different demographics, as much as we like to think our freedom-loving first-world countries provide equally abundant opportunities for everyone. I just think we need to be mindful of that.",2,0

There are only about 500 that create all the puzzles (books included) you find. My mother was an exception, creating puzzles well into her 80's. They become harder as the week progresses, but not because the solutions are harder, the clues become more obscure. All crossword puzzles are diagonally symmetrical. She was also a writer, but changed her first name from Julia to the initial J. spelled Jay, because male writers were favored over female right out of the gate. Any major publisher can verify this. She was also Boston's first female insurance claims adjuster, and fought the good fight to get that job. Many other male adjusters were livid they would even consider her. She got her SCUBA certificate at 40 and pilot's license at 45 while raising two boys on her own. Sorry to ramble but this seems (to me) relevant to the topic. She found ways around the income gap, renting rooms in our house, typing for students, and going back to school to get her Master's in Expressive Psychotherapy at 57.

Secondly males by nature are neither the most emotional or caring of our race. For this reason males make a great choice for doing rolls that are terrible eg garbage man, trauma cleaner, plummers, etc and even in the same field compare a contracts or criminal lawyer against a family or immigration lawyer and there will be a higher number of males in the worse areas. Further because of the lack of emotional it makes the able to make decisions based on an analytical process rather than personal feelings. At the same time these traits are terrible for someone that works in other roles such as child care, nursing, etc. but that's not to say either side of our race is any better than the other it just means that different people are suited or enjoy different roles. Further not all males or females follow the inherent typical male or female ways of thinking. Which is solely why we do see male in roles that females enjoy and vice versa. In actuality it's not actually a problem not only because most people are married at some point and share their income. Or though logically we might actually want to enforce a pay gap for married men to be payed more to give mothers the option of being able to spend more bonding time with their children.

Brain difference and social attitudes and now choices in life! If you account for that, the gap narrows to the point of vanishing. Edit: This is a brief summary of tge response. Now about the topic or most of it of the video, they don't account for most of these things: 1) Men work more hours than women. Because of that, men are more paid than women. This is not sexist. This is common sense! When someone work more, that person get more paid. Men work more so they get more paid. Men often do the dirty work such cleaning. 2) Women often leave their jobs for maternity. The statistics shows that they get paid less. Well did they account for the losing of jobs for mother purposes? It is very factual that women leave their jobs raising kids more than men do for their children. And even if they stayed, as I said, women work less hours after entering motherhood. 3) in this video, they talked about businesses and tech amd one more thing. Well these fields are dominated by men. Men are the majority of these fields. Women are not. In fact, out of the 5 worst paying jobs in the us, 4 out of them are dominated by women while the other are men. While out of the 5 best paying jobs in the us, 4 out of them are majoritaly men and the other is women. That statistics reflect the choices women and men do. But wait does that proves sexism in the work place? No. That is because women dominate biology and medicine and single women are paid more than their male courter part. However, married women are paid less because they work LESS hours and even leave their jobs. While men work more hours, therefore are paid more, they do the dirty jobs such cleaning the sewage and suffer from suicide overwhelmingly and in work, men die more than women die in work.",2,0

My supervisor chose to skip the extra hours except for when he absolutely had to work. I however, went 4 months straight of going to work every single day. And then getting off days only sparringly. And that's when they force me to take off. My supervisor gets every weekend off. But if you looked at only the end result of total money earned, you'd ask ""why is the supervisor earning less than someone positioned under them?""

"A very nice and well put together video with a lot of great data. There is just one problem, All of it is about earnings not necesserily wage. As a matter of fact it is illegal to discriminate on gender for the exact same job. (Equal pay act 1963) Wether a difference in earnings is something that has to be corrected is therefore debatable. I bet you could make a very similar chart for IQ and get a difference in earnings (Not saying women are dumber then men) that wouldn't be based on an outward characteristic. The problem I encounter here is the idea that the desired goal is to have an equal pay across the bord regardless of extra hours worked, negotiations in wage or sick days etc. There are a lot of variables that strifing for equality of outcome, as equalizing earnings would be, becomes a case of holding back people that want and can do more. In a sense it is opressing them by not allowing them to choose to excell, wether man or woman doesn't really matter to me. Quotas and wage redistribution are not solutions.",2,0

"There is nothing wrong with traditional gender roles where the husband is responsible for providing and the wife is responsible for caring. Millennia of history and simple biology tells us that is a strong and efficient default family structure that has kept our species alive this long. If that's what a couple wants, that shouldn't be a topic for a feminist's protest sign just because raising children doesn't get you a paycheck. Money is not the most important thing in the world, even though many people think so. On the flip side, I do also believe that, if both husband and wife want to break from tradition/biology and are both providing, then both husband and wife should be caring as well. It's all about a balance, and the $ on each side is not what it's all about. It's about a happy and functioning home with what the people inside that home consider an egalitarian division of responsibilities regardless of a ""wage gap."" People would do well to establish this before deciding to marry and/or have kids, so they don't just let life happen to them and become unhappy in their home and channel their discontent into an internal hatred of whatever system or movement they think is keeping them down.

"The 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women working full-time by the median earnings of all men working full-time. In other words, if the average income of all men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say, 30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don't reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesn't take into account occupation, position, education or hours worked per week.

The fact people who say that the wage gap actually exist disgust me. If you are a company all you care about is profit. Then no men would ever work ever again because all companies would hire women because it's less of an expense. It is also income not wage. Income is less because it is proven that women don't work as much as women and does not work as much overtime as men. Americans all live in a very very privileged life and the fact that you say women are less then men is just an excuse for their failures.

Its quality and quantity that matters to make money. so money= quality of work x quantity of time given. hence even if quality of both genders remains same the quantity of time poured by women is less because of her maternal instincts which should not be booed by feminists. I respect good mothers who pour in a lot of efforts in their job as well as to their kids. Men and Women are simply just different. If we try to make them look equal or make either gender be superior then its wrong. Proud Egalitarian here :),3,0

The gap is misrepresenting the stats by the fewer collective hours, otherwise the BBB or someone would be stepping in, which goes to show you can't fix something that isn't broken.

People would say chem. engineer but what if the artist was incredibly talented and had good advertising skills than that artist would pay more no matter the gender so if the chem. engineer was male and the artist female would you say I'm wrong , plus what if said artist decided to do commissions by companies and also bid paintings online , so now do you think that the female artist is no richer than some one like Steve jobs. So through those decision's the artist is rich while the engineer is the average male , but what's the difference ? The only difference is the one is talented while the other has no talent nor exceptional education in the field so the only one that's to blame is himself for not picking the most suitable job.

"How the care is divided up can be boiled down to instinct. Men often increase their work hours while, women often decrease their hours, of work. This is something that no amount of social pressure of political activism could ever change, this is because there are biological reactions that women have to rearing children, even years after they're born. Specifically one that happens for most of a child's infancy is lactation. Breast feeding isn't something you can do and work at the same time, even if your work is from home on a computer, and it's something that only women can do. One of the things about the early physical reactions to kids that women have, is that they create habits. In the time that the mother can't work due to recovering from pregnancy and, and a cocktail of chemicals, that the brain releases, resulting in women not even wanting to be away from their child for 5 minuets, The father, assuming that they're still in the picture, has increased his hour of work, in an attempt to ensure that, the family is well provided for. Putting his boss in the habit of expecting him to continue to go above and beyond, which pretty much locks his situation, unless he's willing to loose his job, in which event the family would fall apart due to financial struggles, so he's not going to risk that, and since his hands are tied, by the time the mother is capable of entering the work force again, she ends up having to take a more lenient job with time at work, which often pay less, than the jobs where your lack of presence could cost the company money in which case you'd be fired, so that she can remain on all in case of an emergency with the kids. During early child care It's not possible to divide up the work evenly. and later during child care, People are prone to habit, and often don't bother, trying to fix what isn't broken.",2,0

A big issue mentioned in this video is that women are still responsible for most of the household duties, even with full time jobs. Ever hear of a father on ‚Äúpaternity leave‚Äù? If the responsibilities were more equal, maybe the pay gap would decrease. Yes, in most jobs men and women will get paid the same amount of money, if not there would be an even bigger uproar about this inequality. Its the longterm issues that the pay gap is about, imagine having to try to divide or attention and priorities between work and your children evenly, while your gender counterparts dont have this issue.They can automatically place their attention on work, giving them a leg up in the workplace. Raising a child is a team effort, and what kind of team mate leaves you with all the heavy lifting just to claim the gold medal. Not saying this is the case for every family, but the statistics say its the case for a lot.",1,0

"why have we not shifted our focus after all these decades considreing what has happened? women have become less happy and we have too few children to sustain ourselves... we need to widen the wage gap not close it. we need more kids, more mothers tending to their children. family is more important than wasting away in a cubicle, more important for women, and more important for our society. overall a fairly respectable video, but as is standard with vox, the presentation seemingly made for 5 year olds was revolting as always",5,1

This video acknowledges that as jobs become more flexible, child care becomes less of a conflict and thus narrows the otherwise natural ""gap."" 5. This video does NOT suggest that anything needs to be done other than maybe encourage possibilities that make occupations more versatile; they don't argue that any sexism exists in the first place to fix, but merely that the ""wage gap"" will disappear as jobs become more flexible. Come on people! If you want to argue against the ignorance spouted about how sexist the world is, make sure that you're actually targeting the right things.

Plus I didn't have the will power when going out with friends and family.

"I decided to go vegan just over a month ago and, for the most part, am doing ok with it. I still struggle with work lunches but am adding to my recipes all the time. I'm doing this for the animals, the environment and my health (been diabetic for 10 years). I started with just one recipe- homemade falafel with veganaise. I then replaced my usual bacon and egg breakfast burrito with overnight oats. It's amazing. My sugar used to go through the roof just eating oatmeal with skim milk and sugar. Now, I can have oatmeal with bananas, blueberries, sugar, cashew milk and chia seeds. My sugar actually decreases a bit. It's a freaking miracle. I only just tried the date and banana smoothie a week ago. It was only two bananas and 7 dates but I couldn't finish it. THIS girl who is 225 lbs and could eat 2 large donairs couldn't finish a smoothie! Despite the razzing from family and a husband who refuses to believe that eating meat is bad for you or the environment, I'm sticking with it. I'm not the healthiest vegan yet but I'm sure that will come. Side note: also decided to start studying Buddhism. Why not",1,0

"Hi Freelee, I have been vegetarian since I was eleven years old, always with a keen disinterest in the taste of meat. I recently decided I would go vegan, and began exclusively eating a plant based diet, but despite feeling good I found I was losing too much weight. I wasn't big to begin with so the weight loss was dramatic. I've turned back to dairy and eggs as a dense calorie source but I'd like to continue the transition--though unsure how to expand my stomach enough to accommodate the volume of fruits and veg required to maintain a healthy weight. I hoped you could address this in a future video. Also, I struggle slightly with the idea of consuming as many calories as an obese person, or person ""eating for two,"" and not with the fear of gaining weight, but with the knowledge that our planet has limited resources and in 7.3 billion if half of us are eating for two, wouldn't that seem closer to 10.5 and a deeper strain on the enviroment. Any thought you have on this topic would be great. Thank you ;)",1,0

"It doesn't matter whether or not she's trolling or if she'll stick with it - if we treat her kindly, with respect and thoughtful support, if we help educate her and encourage her, not only will TRISH be more likely to really stick with the plant based diet and hopefully cut out animal consumption in other areas of her life, but it helps spread the message to all of her audience, so her followers can see that vegans aren't crazy, pushy freaks but are actually just concerned people who want to help animals! That could help a lot more people go vegan than just attacking Trish for ""oh she's just trolling"" ""oh she can't do it"". Lets remember to extend our compassion to everyone!",1,0
"When she first uploaded this I thought it was a joke, her trolling so I didn't watch it.

Gay men date gay men, they keep their parts and stay as male Lesbians are women who date women Drag Queens are men who dress up in women's clothing transvestites are men who like wearing womens clothing with no goal to become a woman Transgender male to female and female to male, we are individuals who have body dysphoria, our bodies don't match our brain state. we hate having the parts we were born with and fight to become the the gender which will align with ur mind, heart and soul. we are the ones who get sex changes. Bisexuals are men or women who will date both sexes.

This video pisses me off to the core. Not once have you mentioned real gender dysphoria. In my eyes you need dysphoria to be trans. I hang out with mostly boys too that doesn't make me trans.

The ‚Äúyou can be whatever gender you want‚Äù comment especially pissed me off because that makes trans seem like a choice. Nobody would choose that. I don't want anyone thinking that I think this because she is feminine, but the fact that she always has her chest out, and I'd very confident about her body.

Hi Freelee! I've been watching through a lot of your videos recently and you have been such an inspiration that I really think I wanna go vegan in the near future. Luckily I'm moving back onto campus in 2 weeks where I'll have access to a full kitchen (and away from my large family that I live with who makes having a different eating lifestyle a difficult task). But my main concern is will I be able to make sure my body is getting what it needs? I have problems with my appetite and rarely feel hungry; the act or even just the thought of eating most of the time makes me nausous and dizzy. It's extremely unhealthy I know and I wanna work towards fixing it. Have you encountered anyone who had this problem? What kind of tips can you recommend on ways to make sure I'll be eating enough to live heathily on a vegan lifestyle? It would mean the world to me if you could point me in the right direction or if anyone else has any words of wisdom.,1,0

"So can anybody recommend any vegan baking videos or recipes? Or even books . I've been a veggie for 8 years now, since I was 13.

I miss baking and could do with some yummy recipes to try? Cakes, biscuits etc. Also, I much prefer videos like these. I find the swearing and stuff hard to watch (I understand it's coming from a place of passion but it's nicer to hear much more positivity and encouraging words) :)",1,0

I met this man who was in the street letting people stroke this baby goat he was holding. I asked him what he does and why he has the goat and he is an animal rights activist. That guy in ONE DAY (the day I saw him at about 3pm) had already saved over 100 horses from being slaughtered. He is actually wealthy but lives in a tiny house so that he can own his farm where he keeps animals and let's them die of natural causes and never mistreats them. I want to be just like that man when I grow up,1,0

"to the comments about this being old footage, it honestly doesn't matter. Whether or not she has eaten animals since this doesn't matter because the journey to veganism is not easy for most people. Trisha may relapse multiple times, what matters is that she is making the effort towards being vegan. Its important that she keeps going back to it and getting educated so that she can figure out what works best for her and eventually get to the place she wants to be. If you're vegan yourself, think about how hard it truly was to transition, probably you had to make many enormous life changes so you could become vegan. Trisha is just really starting this journey, finally realizing how veganism is a good thing and she should let it into her life. Cut her some slack, this is an opportunity for education, not for belittlement, if you don't welcome her into the community she won't want to or have the resources to stay.",1,0

Having boobs doesn't mean you identify as a thicc boy it means your a fucking girl. You can't choose your gender your gender is something you so strongly know your are.

However when it comes to ‚ÄúOh i want to be a guy bc they don't have the same expectation from society‚Äù that doesn't justify wanting to be a man (at least in my opinion). Of course it's up to you how you want to ID & i don't want to silence you at all, but I want to make sure you're saying these things as someone who's actually informed on what it means to be LGBTQIA+ .

Guess what? I had a short haircut. I dress in unisex or more masculine clothes most of the time and I have mostly guy friends. It's called being a tomboy. You said you 1000% identify with your birth gender. So do I. You described what being a tomboy is like. That's not what trans is.,2,0

Can't finish this video. Clearly unaddressed trauma and other mental issues have finally taken its toll.,5,1
"I feel like she is so mixed up about terms and what it means to be transgender. She just wants to be casual and seen as a person rather than a sex object (which is how she associates women, probably because most of the time that's her experience and that's not something anyone should have to just accept) and like that's totally valid but that doesnt necessarily mean that shes a man. Being comfortable not wearing makeup in your day to day life and being super low maintenance except when you want attention is not a trait specific to men. That's how a lot of cis women are too. Not wanting attention from random straight men is not a trait specific to men. Having short hair as a woman doesnt make you trans. I have a ""boys"" haircut but I'm a female. It seems like much of her reasoning is just based off of bias of how women and men and gay men and straight men are supposed to be or usually are. Instead of grouping all straight men in with toxic masculinity and misogyny we need to recognize that any man can be feminine if he wants and of course all men should respect women (of course I know it's mostly straight men who dont and who sexualize women and all this, but it's not exclusive to straight men either). Also her comment about having penis envy is another reason I think shes just mixed up. She equates men with power and having a penis with the way shes percieved. She is a woman but the trauma shes experienced from being a woman, especially a very outwardly sexual woman, in todays society has caused her to have extreme biases towards what certain genders mean. I'm not blaming her, this is mostly indicative of a larger problem in todays society, but I feel bad for her that she thinks she has to come to terms with being transgender in order to just live comfortably and dress how she wants. Very concerned with outward image and she feels like she needs to be trans to justify it",2,0
"Your gender fluid,if you wanna be masculine and feminine",2,0

Trans men have a hard enough time trying to justify their existence for you to come in here and say ‚Äúhey I dressed like Troy Bolton and now I wanna be a gay man‚Äù like what the fuck... you're like all about your body and you can't be 1000% identifying as your birth gender and 1000% identifying as trans... like are you dumb or,5,1

"As a hindu, when we were growing up, we were never ""meat"" focused. We were food focused. Beef was not on the menu so whether its here or not makes no difference to us. We fast (where its just vegetables 2 - 3 times a week), our meat eating is reduced to the 4 days and its mixed between lamb, poultry and fish and that too its always mixed with vegetables. What is known as Hinduism knows that meat is not really important. Eat what you enjoy and eat it in moderation but with alot of awareness so you get the satisfaction and proper nutrition. This vegan versus carnivores are just too extreme in my opinion. We believe in balance of life, management of your mind and body. This extreminism is dangerous to our world. Vegans are becoming aggressive and as a result not rallying their cause very well. Who wants to be an angry vegan, neither do I want to be an angry carnivore. Balance in mind and body.",1,0

They look great when they start and they still have the nutrient reserves in their liver and body fat and they loose overweight from going vegan. But then after a while they turn pale and gray. Loose often lots of muscle mass and facial fat giving them that formaldehyde dead eyes look, it's sad people can't think logically and are so brainwashed with this anti human ideology. It's almost as if they can't think clearly anymore. And the more animated they act the more it looks as if they're trying to convince themselves they're not weak, sick and unhealthy looking. I've been looking long at going vegan wondering if it would be healthy, thinking it probably would be but never started until I looked at the opposite side of this diet a.k.a. the carnivore diet then it suddenly became very clear to me that veganism is an unnatural and unrealistic and polluting ideology that's based on new age drivel, lies and deceit and not based on a biological reality. We're ourselves animals with carnivores needs and we're not living on starship enterprise. The planet would be better of if we all ate meat and let the animals freely graze on the planet everywhere since they can eat the plants we can't eat and we don't have to dig up the soil use pesticides or artificial fertilizers and nature could just be nature, we just had to stimulate the facilitation for them to give lots of offspring and we could eat them without hardly any need for the cultivation of land destroying nature.",5,1

"Vegan since October 2018, because all of the good nutrients in meat come from plants. Cutting out the middle man, this makes animalfood unnecessary.

"What gets me is how much work these evil companies have put into hiding this heinous crime they commit. I think if everyone knew all the graphic details of what factory farms do, most would at least cut back animal consumption. That's why these companies go out of their way to make sure we cant find this information easily. I'm one of the most curious people you will ever meet. I have spent time researching almost everything including looking up silly/random topics like ""the history of watermelon."" But these companies go so far out of their way to hide this evil that even someone like me never stumbled up to this topic by myself. My sister mentioned it to me a year ago and that's when I researched and learned about this horror. Even as a lifelong meat eater who LOVES meat and comes from a meat based culture; I couldn't morally continue to partake in this evil. I have been vegan since and will never touch meat again. I'm very old school and grew up with the idea that ""men never cry or show emotions."" I'm basically the stereotypical tough guy who almost never shows emotions. But ever since I learned about this evil act, every once in a while it comes into my head and all I want to do curl up into a ball and weep for the poor defenseless animals that we torture so mercilessly. We have to invent a new word for what we do to these poor animals because even the word ""evil"" doesn't cut it.",2,0

I've been quasi vegetarian for years, eating usually plant based meals, but still enjoying meat and fish occasionally and dairy as a staple. But just before new year I saw among other ghastly footage of cruelty and indignity, a vision-bite of a small animal being tortured and killed for the the food predilections of the Chinese) and that image has stayed excruciatingly present in my mind. It seemed to me that the animal was asking me as I looked straight into her bewildered dying eyes in a moment of direct contact through the camera lens, to be kind, to be aware, to aid and support the life of the world, not eat it. The goddess looked at me through those eyes, eyes that were saying goodbye. I cannot unsee or un-hear her message. So I'm taking up that request.",5,1

"Promotion of processed foods in the name of veganism is unacceptable. Replacing meat with a processed burger that tastes like meat is not veganism. What are we doing here? Supporting processed food industry? I'm a vegan and I have friends who aren't vegan.But I respect them more than those who promote processed food. The environmental cost of processed food is as bad as the cost of non-vegans food. We are told to eat multinutritients to make up for the deficit of essential nutrients. My friends on the other end do not promote supplements. My non-vegan friends do all things good for the environment. They are as concerned for our planet as me.They eat local produce (vegetables, fruits , meats). I'm subtlely doing my bit to change them to veganism, but even if I don't succeed, I will still have them as my friends. At least they are not cheating people in the name of their eating habits, unlike how our vegan community is misled and cheated.

"I have the exact same reaction as Piers Morgan.....when I ate meat. I replayed the part of when he took a bite of plant-based burger, or whatever it was. His face contorted even BEFORE he took a bite. Most people react with disgust when tasting something they don't like......AFTER they've taken a bite! He had already made up his mind he wasn't going to like it. But, his facial expression revealed that it wasn't all that bad. But, because he had bashed vegan food.....and of course, because of his narcissistic personality, he is belligerent and narrow minded. They can't admit when they are wrong.....their way or the highway. I went vegetarian in 2000. I went vegan in 2010. I became vegan after cutting out one food after another to figure out what was wrong with me. I suffered gastrointestinal issues for years! When I cut out dairy, I was absolutely staggered at how much better I felt in one week! I thought it's got to be a fluke. So, I introduced small amounts of dairy thinking a little won't make any difference. All I had was one small 2in x 2in x 1/4in slice of cheddar cheese. I was in unbearable agony ALL NIGHT! I had stomach and intestinal cramping that rivaled being in labor. It was actually worse than labor because I was in horrible pain the entire night and part of the next day. I've never had a childbirth labor last that long. I gave my sister the remaining cheddar cheese package.....she isn't vegan......I'm the only vegan in my family. There are millions of people who are allergic to nuts. The food industry now has clear labeling for nut allergies. It can be life threatening for some people to consume foods that contain nuts. Those of us who are severely lactose intolerant, have struggled for years to find non-dairy substitutes. My best friend was vegan and told me about a website that would help me a lot. It was PETA. I was heartbroken, disgusted and angry when I looked at videos of farm animals being tortured every day after they suffer unimaginable, agonizing pain just so people can have their meat. I never really liked the taste of meat. It always tasted like blood to me. But, because my parents were meat eaters, I was forced to eat it along with the rest of my family. The only way I could eat it was to mix tiny pieces into my mashed potatoes. Now, as a 66 year old grandma, I continue to REFUSE to enable industries that callously and inhumanly torture farm animals.",1,0

"I feel this new vegan movement is going to save lives, praise God. But, many people do not have the option or privilege of following a healthy vegan lifestyle (emphasis on healthy). Until our culture rejects the religion of consumption, I don't think veganism can be sustainable or safe for anyone who is not privileged. This lifestyle requires us to do our research, look for whole food plant sources of many nutrients and monitor our nutrient intake with bloodwork (for B-12 among other things), and then make the time to re-learn how to prepare our own food. Not everyone has access to the time, resources or even cognitive functioning to take on this lifestyle in a healthy way. I've only been vegan for a year and half and acknowledge it as a privilege. I pray that I do not lose access to healthy whole foods, but there is no guarantee.",1,0

If you go on the internet and look for studies you will find what satisfies your agenda, but you won't necessarily find things that accurately show the practical lives of women in the workplace unless you actually go through women to women telling everyone that they are experiencing all sorts of discrimination which are relatively unique to women. Men have their own problems, they're treated awfully in dangerous work, they don't even get the proper care they need when injured, they work longer hours and are even pressured at times to do so to the point where they want to do so. A system in place to ensure that both men and women are paid the same for the same positions of the same jobs with the same level of commitment should be in place everywhere and there is really no denying that.

Proper men put it on themselves to become better ""bread earners"" in order to support their family and there's nothing wrong with that. It's crazy to think that there's people out there who think these ""gender roles"" are oppressive and misogynistic.

Wow. And I thought I was doing alright when I got out of business school. I wasn't even in the same bracket as these men or women.,1,0
For a culture change to happen it all starts with woman. It's their decision on what job they want it's their decision if they want to stay at home and raise a family. No one is forcing any of this on you. If you end up with kids but don't want to quit working then don't. Talk about it to your spouse don't just accept it as oh I'm a woman so he expects me to quit my job. No that's a stupid mentally. You're just hurting yourself with a mind like that. Of course there are jobs out there that will prove too difficult for woman and that's just how our bodies were made. Men have more muscles than woman and their body structure helps with hard jobs but if you want that job too ladies you can. Although some might say it's easier for men to grow in strength doesn't mean woman can't either.,1,0

The nursing profession, the teaching profession, the childcare profession - these are all highly valuable to society and high risk. Yet, the are paid lower amounts.",1,0

"Wow they actually halfway explained the facts instead of just blaming it on sexism. They did leave out that during this time one of the major reasons that the responsibilities with children were so unequally distributed was because this was a time when about half of marriages ended in divorce and fathers rights were being trampled on by the courts and fathers were expected to pay child support and alimony out the ass while having little to no interaction with their kids. So of course if your husband is giving you a check your not going to work as much as the man that has to pay that check.

"Holy crap. 13 seconds into the video and she's already cited an incorrect ""fact"". Using the median income for males and females assumes that men and women are equally represented in all areas of the workforce, equally educated, and equally experienced. An easy way to show this is to compare the number of males in CEO positions as compared to women. The stupid amount of money that CEOs make is going to skew that statistic by a lot. A different study that compared individuals in the same field with similar experience and education found that the income ratio was closer to - 0.95 and the 5% discrepancy was made up for by men prioritizing pay over job satisfaction and men pushing for raises more aggressively. I really wish people would do better research for videos pertaining to this topic. The wage gap is essentially gone in most sectors of the job market.",2,0

Excellent video which actually represents facts and figures. Well done !,1,0

What people miss about the wage gap? It doesn't exist If you count the number of hours women on average work it narrows to roughly 88% If you take into account the different careers women choose it narrows down to 92% If you consider how women are less likely to ask for a promotion from their boss it narrows to 100%.

"I see two solutions to this problem. Wage increases for lower-income jobs. Encourage women to take up CEO and political positions, and ask for raises more. It's well-known that women are not as interested on average in CEO and political positions as men. That is why it's fair that women make up 25% of politicians because about 25% of the people running for office are women. If this has to do with their upbringing, then this can be fixed, but if this is just because women on average don't want those jobs, then the only solution is to raise the wages on lower-income jobs. Also, I find it ironic that women in the US are the majority of people going to and graduating from college, yet they're still under represented in higher income positions.",2,0

"The video kinda proved that the pay gap doesn't exist by itself, however, let me rephrase it. Women are paid less on average because they make different lifestyle choices like working dangerous jobs in remote areas. What the video asserts is the solution is to change the way businesses operate to suit workers. While this is ideal for getting rid of a number previously proven to mean nothing (the gender wage gap) this will never happen as meetings are not scheduled around home life and if they are they will be erratic and inefficient. As such while this is one example I think the message that should be taken from one of Vox's best political videos is that the wage gap is while a fact not one that is directly indicative of the common implication that men are paid more.",2,0
"Field of business demands lot of skills. Couple are risk taking and dominant behavior. Men are naturally more risk takers and try to defeat their rivals. Hence men on field of business generally tend to do better results and hence are more desirable. Therefore better pay. Also there is no such thing as wage gap. It's earning gab which is based on experience, education, talent, how long they spend at job, and how often they get sick.

"The pay gap itself comes down to submissiveness, if you don't stand up for a better wage, you forfeit it and you cant complain. Men tend to follow the ""ask and it will be given to you"" principle more. All potential employees, men or women are usually offered a standard to low rate, its your responsibility as an individual to deny a lowball offer/ask for a higher offer, for if you accept it you share equal guilt to the unfair transaction and have no right to contest what you forfeit. And as women tend to forfeit more than men, its not the pay gap that's an issues, its the inability to ask... Its not just women, many men also fail to ask. Modern day feminists tend to find excuses and demonize the patriarchy they believe exists to deny their fault. Note: just because you believe something to be true, doesn't mean it is... and if the patriarchy does exist, its because women let it happen...",5,1
"Probably the definitive book on this is Warren Farrell's *Why Men Earn More*, written some four years before this study. It identifies 25 areas where men (on average) make different decisions than women (on average). That is, all the points made in this video and more. The central insight is that, ""The road to higher pay is a toll road."": higher pay generally means sacrificing something lower-paid people do not. Why this is so important is that realising the actual reasons for the *earnings* gap empowers women - and men for that matter - to make choices to boost their earning potential, *if that's what they want to do*. Any given person has, of course, the right to decide that they *don't* want to miss their kid's soccer game, move to the other side of the country, or work in a highly stressful and competitive environment. Areas of their life other than their paycheck will doubtless benefit. It's just a bit silly for anyone - regardless of gender - to make these choices then turn around and compare their paycheck with another person who decided the money was important enough to them for them to make these (and other) sacrifices.",3,0

You can argue that women have different jobs than men, but the fact is that they don't work 20% less hours, so they shouldn't be paid 20% less regardless of what their occupation is.

Like I've always said wage gap is a joke. I've said this exact thing years ago and was laughed at. Plus in most hourly wage jobs that require physical labor men are usually grossly underpaid while women are overpaid. If you've ever worked in a warehouse type job that requires lifting you know I'm telling the truth. The fact is men need fewer days off and we are genetically built to work. Women are built to reproduce. Thats not sexism. It's fact. I respect women and if they can do the job they deserve to be paid for it. More often than not they are. Men usually can work more hours and take fewer days off... Thats the gap. Not sexism.,3,0

It's more complex because it's inaccurate. It doesn't represent reality at all. Women and men at the same level of experience and seniority in the same fields earn pretty much the same. The reason there appears to be a gap is as you said women hold disproportionately more lower paid jobs like child care etc Whereas jobs with higher wages like dangerous jobs or jobs in stem fields are predominately male filled. Men also work for more years on average and take less paternity leave than women take maternity leave (mostly because they're offered a lot less). Men are also more aggressive in salary negotiations on average and are more likely to ask for a raise.,2,0

Women also can get paid maternity leave, in which they still get paid their same amount but taking care of a child. 3.

No person shall be imprisoned under this subsection except for an offense committed after the conviction of such person for a prior offense under this subsection.‚Äù This makes it illegal to pay women less than men based simply off of their gender. Therefore; it makes the entire ‚Äúwage gap‚Äù idea simply wrong due to this section that came straight out of the Equal Pay Act that was approved by congress in the year of 1963 on June 10th. While the average man is more likely to take more dangerous jobs that offer more money while women are more likely to take less paying jobs such as Psychology, Early Education, Social Work, Human Services, etc. Now take note that the wage gap is the average earnings of men and women working full-time and it doesn't account for different job positions, hours worked, different jobs, or even the same job. It just accounts for the overall gain. Because of this, it looks as women are payed less when placing the overall profit of men compared to women. Because the more dangerous jobs pay more while the ones women are more likely to take are‚Ä¶obviously not. But hypothetically speaking, let's say that women are paid less. On average, it is said that women make 77 cents compared to every dollar a man makes. Which, if you do the math, can average down to 431,000 dollars lost in an average woman's lifetime or 10,000 dollars each year. If this were true, then employers would only hire women so they could save 10,000 dollars every year that could go to something else would they not? Business owners aren't stupid and they would certainly do almost anything it takes to have extra money in the bank. So why aren't they? Simple, the wage gap is a myth created by feminists to bolster their sad excuse for a movement.",5,1

"the wage gap is just the average, meaning its a generalization of the who earns more money. (key word is earns). first of all women work more low paying jobs. its not sexist if a women chose to be a nurse and not a engineer. nothing is stopping them from choosing to be an engineer, in fact they are helped into it by affirmative action. if a woman does become an engineer and works less hours it isn't sexist. if she is working in a lower paying field like mechanical not civil it is not sexist. nothing is holding women back. they just don't value money as much as most men they usually prefer a job with more stability rather than a private business. if a man is a doctor and a woman is earning less as a nurse they made different life choices. it isn't a super natural invisible entity called patriarchy, its free choice",2,0

"If you want to put a quick stop to the gender earnings gap, you ought to immediately and completely free up the markets, and allow capitalism to thrive. If a business pays people any less than they deserve, that person leaves their job whenever possible to get better benefits somewhere else. You pay a person too much? Your competitors can run more efficiently than you then and top your profits. You might worry that structural sexism would throw a wrench in this system. Not to worry! Market forces are very robust against bigotry because, again, the company that pays its employees based exactly on how hard they work will outcompete and outemploy startups from locally to internationally. The worst thing you can possibly do to exacerbate an earnings gap is to give subsidies to certain corporations and make unions and employment restrictions. If a CEO, entrepreneur, worker, or business as a whole earns money from subsidies, welfare, or union dues (all of which are illegal to not contribute to, these funds are socialized/forcefully taken from citizens) they have no reason to pay their employees fairly or price products fairly- they don't need to work hard at all to earn this perverted capital! Yet, it seems so many who decry this gap are more interested in collectivist, egalitarian ownership of wages rather than allowing people basic property rights and the ability to get employed where they want to. You'll compromise against actual solutions towards the gap every single time, which demonstrates you really don't care about this issue at all.",2,0

The men made more money because they worked more. That isn't a wage gap, no one is slashing cents off of your dollar, you're simply not earning the dollar!

Therefore, they're trading their job, and thus their pay for their children: a choice they decided to make. If you work less you should get paid less, so employers aren't to blame. If taking care of her children makes a woman happier, then she should take care of her children.

"I call BS on 1:10-1:15. ""Women were making 60% less"" is incorrect. 250k is actually 62.5% of 400k, which means women were making 37.5% less. On the other hand, I'm wondering if the numbers were simply very badly made up. 400k is exactly 60% _more_ than 250k. Exactly. The odds that numbers come out that precise in statistics from random studies involving dollar amounts from many people, are incredibly low. So either the numbers are made up, or they are very grossly rounded. That said, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say they don't understand simple math. They saw 400k is 60% more than 250k, and assumed the reverse phrasing would be correct. Two is 100% more than one, but one is only 50% less than two.",2,0
"I can agree that flexible hours would help. However who stays home with the kids is a decision couples make, maybe women need to insist on working as many hours in their jobs as their husbands? Additionally you broke this down into 3 simple categories ( which didn't even go into trade jobs, or labor jobs), rather than specific jobs. An example, oncologists and neuro-surgeons (or any surgeon) is going to make more money by far than a general physician. Some one with a social science degree who goes into business is going to earn less money than a person with a degree in economics or straight up business. This is because more people go into the field of social science than business. Hours worked is another factor, the more hours you work ( even on a salary job) the more likely ( all other things being equal) that you will either get a raise, or a promotion. It also seems that men are more likely to ask for a raise than women, or take the risk of leaving one job for another. There are a lot of things which play into the earnings gap. And it IS an earnings gap, not a wage gap. Same job worked, same hours, same number of years yields a far smaller, or even nearly zero difference in pay.

"I feel like you have missed a critical point to the wage gap fallacy. This is the fact that if you simply aggregate all of the data for full time men's and women's salaries then you are not taking into account that certain career's pay less than others and there are disproportionate amounts of certain gender's working in certain fields. For example, lets take teaching and compare that to construction work. Women are the overwhelming majority of teachers in most countries still to this day and yet teaching in most countries is considered a low pay job, on the other hand construction work pays very well in most first world countries and is dominated by males. You can make many other comparisons such as nurses vs doctors, or retail service assistants vs research scientists and you will come up with similar results. Now the important question is WHY less women are choosing the higher paying career paths, to this there is not a clear answer but studies suggest that women prefer jobs that involve more social interaction. There are other factors, such as strict fitness requirements for certain high paying labour-intensive jobs like construction. However it is intellectually dishonest to ignore these facts just because we don't completely understand the underlying reasons behind them, we need to be focusing on how to get more male teachers and female construction workers if you really want to close this 'gap'. But I'm not so sure that's even the right approach, if women want to work in a field that pays less then why should we tell them they can't, what about freedom for women to choose their career? And is it wrong that teaching should pay less than research science? These are far more tricky to answer and no one seems to want to address these questions at all on this channel.",1,0

"I went to a very good high school, but it was SOOOO politically biased. My junior English teacher and History teacher in high school were and are best friends, extremely intelligent women, and now great mothers. But, they were also the type of feminists to project any information that made them mad, even if it wasn't entirely true. The wage gap misconception was definitely the most glaring of those offenses. By teaching all of their students this misconception, both my history class and English class got into debates about feminism (also because it was relevant to the curriculum) and people used this ""wage gap"" as their base of support that showed the inequality among men and women in the workplace today. In the process, my school basically trained a bunch of smart kids to not think critically and just assume statistics were true or false based on if it agrees with their political views or not. Clearly, this video proves that the wage gap many of my friends and teachers had in mind is not real, but is in the form of a much more reasonable statistic if one was to actually look further into the data instead of getting excited about the it, thinking it is true, and then ignoring the critical thinking process because they want the information to be true; all because it supports their cause. While I do believe that there should be equality in the workplace, there is no way that we can ignore what is actually causing much of the inequality in average pay. To sum up this huge comment: thank you, Vox and everyone involved with this video, for creating a piece related to feminism with good critical and analytical thinking skills instead of spewing incredibly biased and false feminist stories. While you made a lot of feminists look bad for yelling wrong information at people for so long, you also made the movement look much better because you acknowledged (as a very feminist channel) that something many feminists believe is true is not.

There's an earnings gap, based on career choices women make *Paying two people different wages based on gender is illegal. If you've been compensated unfairly, don't take off an hour at work. Contact the labor board, because laws exist to protect you. *Among millennials, the highest paid demographic are single FEMALES, because millennial women are earning way more college degrees than men, and are thus getting better paying jobs, mostly because public school education favors females. *Speaking of STEM, half the medical students, and the vast majority of biology students are female. Last time I checked, medicine and biology are sciences. Don't believe the feminist propaganda perpetuated by women's studies courses. It's not based on reality. Ok, definitely my last post on here.",3,0

"Good video, I did not expect a description of reality, I was on high alert for pandering and mis-information and was pleasantly surprised. Though, I will say, until women prefer men who stay home and find value in homelife there will continue to be disproportionate home-work responsibility disparities. Hypergamy exists cross culturally and racially, and is one of the contributing factors that men (for better or worse) place a higher importance on ""working all the time""/""being a provider"" to attract a mate & poise themselves for a family.",2,0

"I am not a feminist and I actually really liked this video. I think the best part was you gave a somewhat practical solution to a practical problem. I wish more left leaning progressives would do that, because I might actually join them at that point. The biggest problem with progressivism is that their best answer to problems usually revolves around cultural change or societal change. Society and culture are people's responses to the world around them, it's not just a dial you can turn to your liking. The only real way you can change a culture or society is by forcing people against their will to believe your ideology, which historically is best done through a freedomless totalitarian government, like Stalin or Hitler.",3,0

I can tell just by going to college for several of years, in the software programming and tech classes women are nearly non existent while software development is one of the highest paying jobs out there.

The most women I've had in one of my classes was 3, but even that was a database class that can branch from a general business degree. Go even into health care and majority of women you'll hear are going to be a nurse. I don't know if it's insecurities or what, but I don't think people can blame wage gap when it seems most are purposely going for lower paying jobs instead of trying to become a doctor.",2,0

"I have five points about the wage gap. 1. If it were really true, why wouln't companies just hire all women instead of men and make an additional 19% in profits for their share holders? I am sure NO ONE would complain if a company hired all women, in fact, it would be celebrated as a trail blazer. 2. Do we think that every plumber (The vast majority of them are men, by the way) in New York gets paid the exact same amount for unclogging a toilet? If not, there is a wage gap. 3. Why is it NOT your responsibility to know what you are worth and negotiate what you think is fair. If you get what you think you are worth, there is no wage gap. If you don't know or underestimate your worth, it is YOUR problem. The last time I checked, indentured labor is against the law, so if you are not paid what you are worth, it is YOUR responsibility to find another job that pays you a fair wage. 4. Some people, both men and women, will accept less than the market wage in order to compensate for their lack of experience or education. It is an opportunity for them to join the workforce and prove their worth. This is essential for competition, keeping wages in check and giving people a chance to enter their profession of choice. 5.

They show that ""equal"" plus ""father does more""together (47+6) outweighs ""mother does more"" (47). So, in 53% of households, the father is doing the same or more than the mother. Of course when you say ""mom does more"" (47) vs ""dad does more"" (6) it looks like dads do 8x less work. And if you run the graphics by quickly and say that out loud while you do, it adds even more to the misleading nature. The only category of the three presented, where mom does more, is ""taking care of sick kid"" (mom 54, equal 39, dad does more 6). 54 is greater than 46.

When you are talking about people in higher earning positions (let's say 70k+) and it comes time to start a family it is often easier for the woman to take time off work, or leave the work force all together when their spouse is making enough money. This also has a negative affect on women taking on more work, or chasing promotions which comes with more work. There is no real incentive to do so when the husband is earning good money. The combined income of both people earns themselves a very comfortable life style. There simply isn't a NEED for the woman to earn more. Next up, actually compare two people in the same exact position within an industry. Chase as many examples of two or more people in identical positions as possible and study the earnings gap.",2,0

There isn't much that can be done about this as the root cause of these behaviors are biological. Let's just accept that there will be a pay gap, but it's closed when you consider the paying-for-dates gap, and the fact that women control 80% of consumer spending even though men make about 80% of the income in the USA.

They would rather have a fun, safe, low-paying job than a miserable, dangerous, high-paying job. Men are the sacrificial laborers of our society, and we pay them significantly more than women because of that. That is also why women take on the dominant role in the household: because the man is more likely to die, and it mitigates the damage to the home if he does.

This is because it does not include the types of jobs people from the two genders are choosing, for example the STEM fields which pay among the highest salaries are almost solely male, despite the colleges trying to convince women to go into STEM for many many years.

"Does Vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely? I tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points, considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didn't watch the video. I managed to cut it down to a few points. 1. Your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work (E.G business). This creates a misleading argument. In the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men - women in the graduate pool, so its very difficult to accurately say that ""men had higher salaries out the gate"". Do you mean on average or in the whole? What jobs did they take? With what companies? This doesn't account for peoples choices out of school. (ARGUMENT: ""looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from 1990 - 2006"" ""Men earned more out the gate"") 2. It's a fact that many years ago, women were actively payed LESS than men for the same jobs. Its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from 1973 all the way back to 1948. I mean really?! 1948?! The difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons! As they approach their 50's and 60's was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled. Pay was becoming equal, so of course the gap closed. It really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point. (ARGUMENT: 1:25. ""If you look at women born 1973.... Same thing for women 1968... 1948....) 3. If you do want to argue pregnancy: In a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child. Having a child has consequences, good and bad. You have a child you work less to take care of that child. Perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities, but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what. We have maternity leave for a reason for both Male and Females. (ARGUMENT: 2:10) 4. These statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves. Its illegal to pay women less, these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading. Stop saying the word PAY. Women aren't PAYED less. They earn less yearly because of their choices in the job. (ARGUMENT: 2:45) 7. If you dont show up for work, or can't work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much. I dont care if your pregnant. I dont care if you are lazy. You dont show up, you dont get payed. You are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying, Women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them. If you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made. Society doesn't have too pander to fit your every need. (ARGUMENT: Some jobs require really specific hours"" ""not available to her clients when they need her"". 3:30) I could go on but this is boring now. Your still citing statistics from the 1970s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in 2017. So congratz, if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now, because women work less hours, you did it. Women aren't paid less than men, so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading. Women get the same salary as man. Women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices, jobs, hours, etc. This entire video was confusing and misleading. It sounded like you were saying women are payed less, then you were saying they weren't, but all i took out of it was that ""in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women"".

I've seen women throw it all away to be mothers and I've seen men throw themselves into work to support their families, at the cost of rarely being with them. The happiest families are those who find a happy medium, but the woman should be the caregiver and the man the breadwinner. That's just how it works.",2,0

"There is no ""wage"" gap, there is however an EARNINGS gap, as people who do the same job with the same credentials tend to get paid the same amount, because regardless of the business owner, they want to maximize profits and thus pay their employees as little as possible while still retaining more skilled individuals. However if Billy works 50 hour weeks, and Mandy works 40 hour weeks, one will make more initially, and be more likely to receive promotions in the future which results in better wages and thus even greater earnings down the line.

"wage gap isent a thing, comparing all the avrg of all men and all women what you actualy get is a representation of how strong the difrence between the rich and the poor is. lets say 1000 people from group x get to earn 2000 a month. another group of 800 people caled group y earn 2000 aswell, yet 150 of those do not have eny income and 50 of those have an income of 10000. now you have a group in wich the avrg earning for 800 people is 2000 and 200 people in this group wherefor the avrg earning is 2500. now you have an avrg of something around 2100 for group y. so yes, on avrg group x will earn les then group y, but do you realy want to be a part of group y where you have a 7.5% chance to end up in poverty and posibly die of starvation at the off chance of 2.5% where you might earn more money as you can spend? on top of that you have to take into acount that those who are earning 10000 a month probably are giving up the chance of a personal life starting from there 20's to there 50's. now so lets say you dont want to be a part of this group that gives up everything to earn money. now you are just stuck with a 8.75% chance to end up in poverty. and a 91.25% chance to earn a living. unlike the 100% chance to earn a living. So you tell me, would you rather be a part of group x or y? I know what my answer will be. I would like to be part of group x and on avrg earn les then group y.

The reason women do almost all of the work of looking after babies is that feminists have brainwashed the world to believe that men are incapable of nurturing and gentleness.

"All you people dancing with joy that the wage-gap does not exist and feminists are wrong should re-think this whole situation. Women don't talk about this because they want the same pay for the same job, cause that has been already dealth with. (And I mean sane women. Not idiots featured in Buzzfeed videos reading the scripts they're given) They just want equal treatment in the workplace. That is the problem and the main reason why women are flagging up the disproportion in total earnings of men vs women. The inequality exists because of women being expected to engage in the family life more than men (that is one of the reasons, imo it's the biggest factor). In today's society success is measured (unfortunately, but it's the truth) by how much money you make and how great of a professional career you have. It applies to both genders. Women feel like they will have a tougher time with accomplishing that kind of success than men. And it is rightly so. Most of us, men and women, want to have children one day. But for women having children means that their professional career will take a hit. Just to make this a bit more real: one of my friends asked her boss why her colleague was given a promotion although she's been working for the company for a longer time (she left out the fact that he's not as good at his job and the fact that he is a man; she didn't expect that would be the reason) and the answer was: well you have two children at a young age so we thought giving you more responsibility right now could be damaging to your private life. Fun fact - the guy also has two children at a very similar age. Of course, my friend left that company. Thank god. Obviously, that inequality is not men's or women's fault. It's how our society is built. But we should look at possibilities of dealing with that problem, as increasingly women are just giving up having children completely. The ageing society is already a huge issue that is progressing. Something needs to be done and as of now there are many people - again both male and female - that are not even acknowledging that the problem exists! Wake up people. I tried to stress that no one who is a sane human being is blaming MEN for this. It's not all of the men of this planet that should get together to fix this. It's a problem of the society as a whole and we should try to deal with it. That's all.",1,0

While the men who still shoulder most of the expenses continue to compete for higher wages, which makes It appear men make more then women on AVERAGE. The simple truth is it is life choice decisions that affect income. On the opposite end of the spectrum I have seen female coworkers who are extremely career oriented and they make higher income in higher positions then other men because they don't care about having kids or have a male partner who works in a lower paying position and is the house husband. It all comes down to choices but feminists and gender inequality advocates don't want to hear that. Also, evidence shows that men on average don't live as long as women so go figure.",2,0

Working mothers are seen as women denying their responsibility of child rearing. However, it's the opposite for working fathers- they receive empathy from their bosses and have a higher wage than average men. But what if the working mother is a single mom? How is she supposed to raise her children alone and earning half of what a man earns per hour? This video is also very misleading and disappointing. Even if you say that it's only temporary,in other developed countries,like Japan,the wage gap actually widens even more after the thirties,and reaches its peak at fifties. And years of reduced make a huge difference on a woman's life. We should stop trying to excuse ourselves and start working on solving the problem we created.",1,0

Lots of women in power seem to see themselves as an exception and supporting another woman is threatening to their perceived special position as a woman.

Honestly what bothers me is treating the Men as the bad guy in this statistic. I mean the use the fact a lot of women want to have kids as the big reason for the gap.

Yeah a man. I swear it like this statistic tries to frame men as these Greedy bastards cheating women out of their money but... If the woman stays home with kids that leaves the man responsible to earn money for that woman with kids so this horrible image of a man cheating woman out of her money is in fact earning money for the family.

"the main reasons there's a wage gap between men and women: 1. women have more paid time off work compared to men when they have children. this creates a debt to the companies that pay them. 2. more women leave work or reduce their hours to spend more time in a homemaker role compared to men, making it difficult for firms to earn back the extra debt that women create compared to men. meaning that women are taxed as a gender to pay back the debt that is created by the entire gender. (which is also why the wage gap closes towards their later years because they can put more time into work instead of homemaking). 3. men are more competitive and aggressive (due to our naturally higher testosterone levels) which means men are more likely to take risks, apply for the higher paid jobs, more productive in highly stressful work environments, more likely to have the skills for senior level positions, and are wayyy better at asking and negotiating pay rises.

Is someone willing to talk to me about why it is hard for some ladies to understand that there will be the wage gap for men tend to take risks and the jobs that go along with the risks are rewarded with a higher pay. If majority of women do the jobs that are secretarial oriented they shouldn't expect to be paid more or equal to the man climbing a 15ft tree or digging out sewers and of course you forget the electricians who have to work themselves through the wires and some get electrocuted. Therefore women and men can not make the same because men tend to go for the jobs which are high end risky and jobs that involve a lot of mental capacity put into them and men do very good at them. That's my take on the issue.,2,0
"Yes, the wage gap seems real, and this video makes a good explanation that the women usually spend more time on the children, thus they would get less money for work with specific hours, but I dont get how this is that big of a problem as some people make it out to be, when most women with children also have a husband, who can use that extra money he makes to support the whole family.",2,0

"I guess the ""wage gap"" as represented here (not caused by active discrimination, but work time choices) does exist between the sexes. I just don't understand, why it is always put into the perspective of sexist discrimination. I wouldn't deny there to be still some issues with that but just concentrating on this factual ""wage gap"" here, I do not see, why it is seen as such an important cause to close it (by force). As presented here, it seems that the ""wage gap"" is mainly caused by the division of parenting tasks partners choose, in which women still often do more of the unpaid work at home and therefore earn less careerwise. Surely our society will change, so I guess, work at home will be seperated more equally and I don't think this is a bad trend, as it promotes egalitarian principles and so on. This however is a cultural issue, as this wage gap is mainly based on this choices and not structual discrimination. It's comparable with the single mom single dad ratio maybe. Yes, there are essentially more single moms than dads and maybe it would be nicer to have this more equally, but it is not due to discrimination of men but rather because of the still existing sex models, children stay with their moms. So it would be nice to dicuss this topics without always putting things as discriminative.",2,0

You can't be the best at work and have a all the time most people want in their families.",1,0
"It's simple: The wage gap doesn't exist, why? Because if it did, then companies left and right would be hiring females exclusively to save 21% of money from paying their worker's income. Meaning, that rather paying a good number of their male workers $1, they'd have to pay their all-female workers $.79, saving that extra $.21. It doesn't take extensive research nor rocket science to debunk the wage gap myth, however the point about women being also busy at home and how it relates to their wage is also a good example of why women also earn less in jobs than men. Great video!",2,0
The outright denial of reality that some people show in these comments is disturbing.,2,0
"Is there a gap in these fields? I don't think these were studied: bricklayers roofers aircraft mechanics plumbers road surface repair workers heavy equipment operators hazardous waste disposal technicians compressed gas delivery techs pallet jack operations tree trimmer/climbers firefighters chemical processors dockworkers drillers explosives handlers petro yardworkers pipefitters field laborers (power generation) containment cable riggers forklift operators for hazardous materials HVAC service technicians fiber optic installers toolmakers lathe operators underground construction crewmembers coal miners loaders/unloaders fuel station monitors utility maintenance techs welders window installers yard laborers elevated concrete laborers wastewater treatment operators machinists truckloaders iron workers (bridge) iron workers (tunnel) iron workers (elevated construction) ironworkers (rebar & structural) These are all fields that are overwhelmingly male, and this is HARDLY a comprehensive list. I get the distinct impression that nothing hazardous or dangerous ever comes up when discussing this fictional gap because in the West, women have it so good, they retain the luxury of not even having to THINK about jobs that can kill them. In this issue, I'm suspicious that is the case. When the gap comes up hazardous jobs are never mentioned. Show less",2,0
vox this is why i love you,1,0
Ughhh Vox was SO close to admitting the wage gap doesn't really exist for sexist reasons. So close.,2,0
"Wage gap is 98 cents on the dollar, within the margin of error",1,0
"this is a wonderful video, can we get it more views that any of stupid lacy greens videos?!",1,0
"so work less get paid less, hmmmm....",1,0
Well doesn't that show that the wage gap is not based oh discrimination just job choice and different hours,2,0
5:02 Ice cream taster? Sign me up.,1,0
"If women want to close the wage gap, become educated in more valuable vocations, work as many hours as the highest earning men, and don't have children, just like how men have no guarantee to have children It's solved. Now do it and stop complaining.",2,0
"It's still an indiviual Problem. If you get less money, it's because you earn less, it Dosen't matter what your gender is",2,0
This gives the information that is needed. I am glad that for once Vox has given some context to this subject. With this proof that they understand the reasons I don't know how you can claim that there is something insidious behind this phenomenon.,1,0
"women are choosing to raise children and that's what is increasing the gap, so it's their fault? yeah ill believe that when paid PATERNITY leave is a thing. I guarantee most women who choose to leave their jobs because of giving birth do it because the husband can't get paternity leave. make paternity leave a thing and I guarantee the gender wage gap will decrease. right now American society basically forces women to leave their jobs unless they already have enough money for private child care, and most don't",1,0
"this conveniently leaves off how men often are demanded of higher hours, more risks, more time away from family etc. the parts where you complain about woman taking more household roles and losing hours tends to be where the men of the family pick up extra hours and more responsibility at work. the messed up part is often time woman expect men to do this in families. so the men start making way more than the woman and then when there is an apparent pay gap, this kind of video gets made saying ""oh the poor woman are getting paid less!"" complain all you want, it's just simple. woman do less and get paid less and men are being worked to death for that higher pay. maybe sometime vox should do something about how men are getting shafted by this trend too",2,0
"It's not factually correct if you have to give so much context. It's far less deceiving to say that men and women make the same amount per hour on the same job. Whoops that's wrong too women are being paid more in some jobs on that equivalent scale now. But I'm glad Vox gave context even if the video still keeps saying ""Wage Gap"" when there is none when you factor in everything.",2,0
"The devisive thing that people put upon these statistics is that the descriptor and defining factor of wage gap is ""gender"" which is completely unfounded. This video helps denote that there are so many factors that create such gaps. They are logical and make total sense just based on the structure of society.",2,0
This is correct. Very good explanation Vox. But... don't call it a wage gap because it's an earnings gap. Two different things.,1,0
I would watch the whole video or consider it relevant if it wasn't a woman talking,5,1
anyone else annoyed by the way she ends every sentence?,3,0
If there are 58 genders. What wage gap are we talking about?,3,0
No one mentions the gender spend gap. Women love to shop and flash hubby ' s credit cards while hubby is slogging his guts out at work.,3,0

"Most women go to college,most men don't go to college it take a lot to go to college then you're in debt",2,0
"The weaknesses of the video are as follows: they still insinuated that discrimination was a factor, as they failed to mention otherwise, they didn't talk about wage negotiation, they neglected to mention that most women choose to raise children (and yes, there are studies that give a clear indication that both men and women prefer this to working, so it is indeed a privilege for women to do so), and perhaps most importantly they failed to mention that these industry-specific differences are literally everything to do with specialisation and earned promotion.",2,0
"Jesus, it's so painful to listen to her vocal fry!",2,0
You'll get paid the same if you do as good a job,2,0
This is a very simple explanation of the wage gap. I had a hard time understanding before but I can see now how it does exist.,1,0
"Good informative video, I think something that wasn't mentioned that could affect a women's wage is the likelihood of them taking time off or quiting their job all together. I think men get paid more because they are much less likely to be out of work, for children, for maternity leave. From a company's point of view it's just more reliable to pick a man to do the job; and in a general sense they are a more financially sound choice.",1,0
Feminism is bullshit in my opinion,2,0
tl;dr: it's not unequal pay for equal work,2,0
"So sad that women putting children first is now considered an inconvenience and a burden, but, it does explain part of why the country is getting so messed up.",2,0
the wage gap doesn't exist,2,0
there is no wage gap due to sexism if you work hard enough youll make the same,2,0

Still, I always wind up coming back to you because there really is such a sweetness and kindness that just radiates from you... I really believe that this is why so many people watch you. You're the kind of person that just draws people in. I think it would be cool to make a video on junkier vegan foods and/or meat alternatives for Trisha. I know the goal is partly health, but I really believe that if she is exposed to just how many DELICIOUS vegan chips and pastries and whatever are out there - she may begin to see just how sustainable and restrictive veganism is.

"okay. trisha. you identify as a female. you literally said you identify as your natural-born gender, which is female. shut the fuck up with your transphobic bullshit. oH nO yOu hAd tO WeAr SpOrTs BrAs ?? bitch shut up. that doesn't make you trans at all. you're a tomboy. you literally have no dysphoria. YOU HAVE YOUR FUCKING *TITS* OUT THE ENTIRE FUCKING TIME. you have more male characteristics. oh you don't wanna be the center of attention ? THAT DOESNT FUCKING MAKE YOU TRANS. girls don't have to wear makeup or do their hair to be a girl. i'm a trans guy, and i fucking hate this video so much. just because you're into gay guys doesn't MAKE YOU A GUY. let me say this again. YOU. ARE. NOT. A. MAN. so many people have ‚Äòopposite sex envy' and they aren't trans. i'm sure a LOT of girls, especially ones going through puberty, envy men because it'll make their life easier. that's not what dysphoria is. dysphoria is NOT opposite sex envy. dysphoria is wanting the opposite sex because ITLL MATCH THEIR GENDER. gender dysphoria is a legitimate mental thing. genderfluid doesn't exist. some gay men date ftm people and don't have a problem with having sex with them despite their female parts, because they don't have gynophobia. some gay men DO have gynophobia. but that's not my point; my point is that YOU ARE NOT TRANSGENDER. you are a CISGENDER FEMALE. coming from a REAL trans guy, you experience little to no gender dysphoria. i apologize for being so rude, i'm normally not and i normally try to have a rational and respectful conversation, but i'm so pissed at this. a lot of people don't like their given name. not all of them are trans. you really need to get the idea that you're even remotely considering being trans. you were happy with short hair because you don't like the responsibility of having long hair. most REAL trans guys want short hair because that's typically MASCULINE. MASCULINITY does NOT EQUAL MALE. FEMININITY does NOT EQUAL FEMALE. you can be a feminine boy, or a masculine girl. your attraction does NOT have ANYTHING to do with your gender/identity, unless your attraction to men (being ftm but not knowing) makes you feel gay, or vice versa. that would be the only instance that attraction affects identity. when you're trans ftm, you don't have a ‚Äòmale side', because you ARE male. YOU are not male. you are not a gay man. seriously, don't identify as trans or come out unless you've seen a licensed GENDER THERAPIST and have been DIAGNOSED with gender dysphoria. yes, you actually have to be diagnosed. in most places, you need an official diagnosis to go on hormones or just medically transition in any way. but, of course, you can't medically transition because you'll just develop dysphoria, because you're transitioning to something that you think you want/are, but really you don't/aren't. please, spare yourself the time, energy, hate, and dysphoria and SHUT UP. get the idea out of your head that you're even remotely trans. please.",5,1

"As a trans guy myself, I think there's a huge difference than being trans and not really feeling like a woman. I personally can't speak on your feelings, but j think you need to do you reserch. So many people who think they're Trans but aren't because of other issues that they believe could be fixed my being different gender. For instance you being attracted to gay men doesn't mean your a gay guy, you just happened to be attracted to some of the qualities they have. I think that it's awesome to try out new pronouns and to experiment, but I don't believe in just going straight in and coming out as a trans guys. I think one thing for me that really makes me confused about this is the fact that you've gotten Multiple breast jobs to enhance your boobs. As a trans guy that would absolutely KILL me. You can obviously do whatever you want, and I hope you well in your transition. But I think you need to do way more reserch and figure out if you want to become a man, not just a drag queen.",1,0

"Coming from a gender-fluid person: To me, it sounds like she might be genderfluid, or maybe non-binary. Also, people using the pronoun 'they' don't have disassociate personality disorder. I use they/them pronouns personally for several reasons - it feels a lot more neutral to me, and I prefer that. Sometimes people using 'her' and 'he' make me feel highly uncomfortable, and I know it's not right. So I use they/them, because I feel like it fits me more. Also, 'they' is used as a singular pronoun a lot in English; when you don't know someone's gender, you use 'they/them'. Like if someone said ""Oh, it's my friend's birthday today"", a perfectly normal response would be: ""Oh, tell them I said happy birthday!"". Ergo, they/them can be used as a singular pronoun, and a lot of people feel more comfortable with that, and that's a-okay.",1,0
"Actually fuck yourself. You're FEMALE. In every single way. You are not trans, you do not have gender dysphoria. I am SO insulted by this as a REAL transgender man. You have zero masculinity which is needed to be female to male. Ask a doctor educated on the human brain or gender identities and they will say you are born with a MALE, or FEMALE brain. You were born with a FEMALE brain and everyone sees that. You are far too old to be doing this shit. With the amount of people who know you it is SO wrong to be posting this. It is WRONG to allow anyone to think being transgender is even 1% a choice. Jesus. Please delete your channel",5,1

"so if I understand correctly because you don't wear a lot of makeup in 'real life' and you're not overly feminine you're a guy? (3:00-3:47) you are not a male because you do not identify with femininity/female gender roles/ female societal expectations and saying OTHERWISE is crazy harmful. gender =/= sex. Honestly the more I think about it, the more I'm realising radical feminists have the right idea when it comes to understanding sex/gender. If you identify with a gender that's different to your own (so in this case masculinity instead of femininity) you should work to dismantle gender norms to make it so a female can do traditionally 'masculine' things (like....not wearing makeup) without it being weird. Your sex and identity aren't the problem and you shouldn't work on changing either so it matches whatever gender roles you want to follow. Again the implications of doing this are crazy. I don't understand why a right winger saying females= makeup is sexist, but somehow wrapping the same talking point in leftist mumbo jumbo is all of a sudden progressive.or take use another example you gave 'I feel male because im assertive'= progressive. I'm not even mad at you Trish, we live in a society that's so binary that its very normal to feel the way you feel. But I hope you realise soon that you are NOT a male just because you don't 100 percent behave the way you are expected to as a female. You're just normal. no-one identifies with their gender/gender roles 100 percent. edit:I've just finished the vid and i think the issue here is that the female form is very sexualised by the Male Gaze, and I think in many ways presenting as a 'male' ( short hair, binding, wearing baggy clohes) is a way for you to evade that very sexualised perception of your self by men. The freedom you feel by presenting as a man makes sense. As you've said males are free from the expectation to wear makeup, we don't have to 'do' our hair, we don't get looked at it or hit on by weird sleazy dudes. Sending you lots of love, it probably isn't at all to feel what you're feeling. And I hope all the people attacking you take a step back and realise how normal it is for you to feel the way you feel as a woman, in society like ours.The Male Gaze is toxic af.",2,0

There is obviously something really wrong with her. She has absolutely no idea who she is or where she belongs and this in it self is a problem & most likely started when she was a child. As much as we all want to hate on her, the poor girl is literally losing her mind in front of millions and making millions in the process.

You can identify as those and not use ""they/them"" use any pronouns you prefer, have people call you he/her if you like. But Trans is a different thing entirely from what you are describing here. Also, saying you are basically a ""drag queen"" does not make you trans. Some drag queens/kings are trans, some are not, some are straight, some are gay, some are other things.

"*SCIENCE AND STATISTICS:* Un-brainwashing from plant based / vegan ideology and lies requires the basic knowledge and understanding of statistics and how they are being used to lie to you, so you can believe in falsehoods and pseudoscience. General population have no idea about statistics. All vegans and all plant based advocates have ZERO understanding of statistics. Nothing that vegans do or say is supported by scientific evidence. Statistics from nutritional science, and especially from nutritional epidemiology are completely meaningless and do not reflect the reality in any way, shape or form. Risk assessments based on these statistics are meaningless, you simply can't apply them to real life. And even the most of experimental research that we have is of low quality and you can't infer a causation from it or show long term effect of a potential dietary intervention. If you want to know how you are being misled and lied to with statistics: - learn about p-hacking in science and scientific literature - read this paper: ""Misuse and Abuse in Statistical Science"" by Kiranmoy Chatterjee - read this paper: ""Why Most Published Research Findings Are False"" by John Ioannidis - read this paper: ""The Mass Production of Redundant, Misleading, and Conflicted Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses."" by John Ioannidis - read this paper: ""The Challenge of Reforming Nutritional Epidemiologic Research"" by John Ioannidis - read this paper: ""Neglecting Major Health Problems and Broadcasting Minor, Uncertain Issues in Lifestyle Science"" by John Ioannidis - read this book: ""Doctoring Data: How to Sort Out Medical Advice from Medical Nonsense"" by Malcom Kendrick - read this book: ""Standard Deviations: Flawed Assumptions, Tortured Data, and Other Ways to Lie with Statistics"" by Gary Smith - read this book: ""How To Lie With Statistics"" by Darrell Huff - read this article: ""85% of Statistics are False or Misleading"" - read this paper: ""Using, Misusing and (Mis)Understanding Statistics"" by Mark Schirmer - read this paper: ""How statistical deception created the appearance that statins are safe and effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease."" by David M Diamond and Uffe Ravnskov - read this book: ""Proofiness: The Dark Arts of Mathematical Deception"" by Charles Seife - get yourself familiar with these 2 quotes and learn what they represent: ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.""

"am 13 years old and live in Texas. I live in a household of meat eaters and I personally, I've been pescatarian for about 8 to 9 months. I recently made the switch to vegetarianism, and I really really really really really really really really really really want to be vegan. I could've made the switch instantly a yr ago to plant based but it would've been too hard on my family, which is what's keeping me from it now. It is tough considering my family torments, criticizes, and teases me about my lifestyle choices. my family is proud and supportive of me (even if it may seem otherwise) and helps me afford tofu, extra produce and etc. along with monthly doctoral check ups since I am an avid athlete both in volleyball and school sports. I try to cut out dairy whenever I possibly can. I substitute milk's cheeses yogurts and etc. for the plant-based versions, And it is more accessible considering my mom is Dairy intolerant. So I practically am vegan. I am very mature for my age and try toEducate myself on the topic pretty regularly. I have seen all documentaries I know of on PBN, Netflix, and a surplus on YouTube. I don't think my family fully Grasps the logistics of veganism. I have tried numerous times to get my family to watch documentaries with me but repeatedly have been bombarded with no(s) And attacks on my lifestyle choices. When in reality all I'm trying to do is to help educate and inform my family about their daily choices, and to help them understand my perspective. My dad has made numerous comments saying ‚Äúyou only eat grass‚Äù or ‚Äúyou need to actually do research‚Äù when all my dad has done is listened to a few podcasts of biased farmers. I eventually tracked my mom into watching the game changers with me on Netflix by telling her it was a documentary based on athletes which is partially true. But it ended up practically pointless because she fell asleep 10 minutes into the movie. I have tried numerous times since then to have her watch some with me but, and I quote ‚Äú I don't want to watch cute little animals die‚Äú As an answer. Which proves she knows what she does on an everyday basis is Morally, environmentally, ethically, and for health reasons is wrong!!! It Frustrates the crap out of me!!!! For goodness sake she's freaking dietitian! Especially for diabetes, which is caused by.... oh you guessed it! The saturated fat and cholesterol is animal products!!! Ughhhhhhhhhhh!! please help me!! What can I do? Any suggestions to help me convince my parents my point of view, to watch a documentary, anything!! Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee!!! Oh PS PBN I was literally waiting for so long for this documentary to come out and when I saw it in my suggestions/home page I said skrew sleep! I'm watching this lolüòÇüòÇüòÇ",1,0

"well the only problem is many peoply replace the meat with stuff made of soy. all in all good except millions of squaremiles of rainforest gets incinerated to plant soy there and when the soil is deploited they have to incinerate a new piece of forest to get new land for their agriculture and the dead soil they leave behind doesn't get enough time to recover and becomes a degradated forest. we can't continue this, th rainforest is the biggest carbondioxide storage of our planet and destroying it sets all this carbondioxide free to damage our climate even more if we want to save the planet soy isn't a choice even though of course most of the soy isn't even consumed by the human. we still have to care about where the stuff we consume comes from",1,0

"Veganism/plant-based eating is the only thing that makes sense for health and Specity (humanity + all living species). BUT to use the climate-fanaticism in this is a BIG MISTAKE, as there is not human-caused CO2-based climate problem worth talking about - We could talk about pollution - (all the shit that does not include CO2) - and which seems to have been forgotten completely in the CO2-frenzy. THAT is a HUGE PROBLEM!!! CO2 is a greenhouse gas in the sense that it makes everything grow faster (ask anybody with a professional greenhouse operation) and hence ""greening"" the planet - but since it is heavier than air - and always will fall down (ever heard about gravity?) - and cannot hold heat, it does not cause any traditional greenhouse effect... When the Grand Solar Minimum is cooling the planet dangerously, and the whole Global Warming thing is debunked finally - it may take the whole vegan movement with it - which would be a disaster for the reasons mentioned above.....",2,0

"I'm a long-time advocate of whole plant-based diet, and I'm very supportive of anything that gets large portions of the population to make the switch away from animal products. However, the attitude toward food and diet and what we associate it with needs to change as well. Food and diet should be viewed primarily as a component of health and hygiene. Instead, we are all too often associating food with pleasure, celebration, and entertainment....which also includes all vices such as alcohol, tobacco, illegal drugs, gambling, pornography, casual sexual encounters, and many other hedonistic obsessions that are all harmful to health in the long-run. People eating some of these new, plant-based substitutes for burgers, sausages, and other animal foods are holding on to their traditional sources of pleasure. I also agree that we need to eliminate animal farming for various reasons including environmental protection. But, again, it is folly to believe this will solve the problems we face with pollution and climate warming. The only solution that will ever have a chance of saving us from ourselves, if it isn't already too late, is to dramatically downsize human impact on the planet, and that can only happen by an equally dramatic downsizing of the global population. Unless that happens, and happens consistently and fairly quickly, we are toast....all the other efforts to reverse climate change will not be sufficient, not even close.",1,0

Insecticides mostly petroleum based that are sprayed on the plants contaminates the bees who pollinate everything and the run off contaminates the streams. I live behind a 500 acre soy bean field and the ammonia fertilizer that is sprayed sometimes is so strong I cant breath. I have raised bees that die because of mass spraying of insecticides so don't act like you are saving the world by eating your veggies. You want to save the world grow your own veggies and good luck trying to raise a productive garden without using pesticides . I have raised many gardens and it ain't easy. I have chickens and they will lay a egg a day without a rooster .If they aren't eaten they will just rot. A rooster has to be present before they can get fertilized to hatch life .So I have no problem with vegetarians but because a egg is in cornbread or cake and you can't eat it because you are vegan thats just a little out there for me but I still respect you . I also have a few well cared for cows and goats who clean up the land so I don't have to mow .,1,0

So the gender wage gap has nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with personal choices. It cracked me up that at the end she suggested we need to change jobs that reward working long hours because women don't tend to choose to work long hours.

Wage gap is completely bullshit,2,0
"Copied from ""Chris"" Does Vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely? I tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points, considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didn't watch the video. I managed to cut it down to a few points. 1. Your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work (E.G business). This creates a misleading argument. In the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men - women in the graduate pool, so its very difficult to accurately say that ""men had higher salaries out the gate"". Do you mean on average or in the whole? What jobs did they take? With what companies? This doesn't account for peoples choices out of school. (ARGUMENT: ""looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from 1990 - 2006"" ""Men earned more out the gate"") 2. It's a fact that many years ago, women were actively payed LESS than men for the same jobs. Its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from 1973 all the way back to 1948. I mean really?! 1948?! The difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons! As they approach their 50's and 60's was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled. Pay was becoming equal, so of course the gap closed. It really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point. (ARGUMENT: 1:25. ""If you look at women born 1973.... Same thing for women 1968... 1948....) 3. If you do want to argue pregnancy: In a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child. Having a child has consequences, good and bad. You have a child you work less to take care of that child. Perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities, but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what. We have maternity leave for a reason for both Male and Females. (ARGUMENT: 2:10) 4. These statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves. Its illegal to pay women less, these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading. Stop saying the word PAY. Women aren't PAYED less. They earn less yearly because of their choices in the job. (ARGUMENT: 2:45) 7. If you dont show up for work, or can't work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much. I dont care if your pregnant. I dont care if you are lazy. You dont show up, you dont get payed. You are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying, Women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them. If you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made. Society doesn't have too pander to fit your every need. (ARGUMENT: Some jobs require really specific hours"" ""not available to her clients when they need her"". 3:30) I could go on but this is boring now. Your still citing statistics from the 1970s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in 2017. So congratz, if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now, because women work less hours, you did it. Women aren't paid less than men, so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading. Women get the same salary as man. Women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices, jobs, hours, etc. This entire video was confusing and misleading. It sounded like you were saying women are payed less, then you were saying they weren't, but all i took out of it was that ""in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women"". The simple answer is NO. Btw i cited every source i could in your video. Every point i made has your quotes and even the video times. You quoted a lot of studies.

"So what you're saying is that women earn less because they have children, which then restricts the hours they can work and reduces their relative levels of experience when compared with people who have worked full time for the most part? The other gaps are likely due to the fact that men and women are different with men having more physical strength, more body mass, higher muscle body composition ratio, being taller, more likely to take risks, slightly higher IQ's, family roles encouraging males to work harder to support the family while the woman is caring for the baby, ect... Until you invent a way for children to be made without the need for a mother and for as long as you're not pumping little girls with relatively huge amounts of testosterone, HGH and retraining them to not be risk adverse or perhaps giving little boys drugs to make them more compliant and drugs to stunt their growth, reduce their testosterone drastically, there will always be a wage gap.",3,0
If women that are not care givers and single without kids are making less than a man then we have a problem.

"To fix this gap you don't make jobs more flexible time-wise. That's just stupid. What you do is make sure that domestic duties, especially involving children, are split equally between husband and wife. This way women can have kids and still have a career in a job that demands a lot of time. Also women are treated unfairly in the workplace. They're seen as less effective and evaluated under harder criteria than a man is in order to get promoted. To fix this gap we need to make sure women are respected and seen just as capable as a man is and also make sure that domestic work is something everyone should do and is not considered ‚Äúunmanly‚Äù. Because a lot of these things are not outright discrimination and mostly on the subconscious level we do not realize it is a problem. But it is and it has shown the consequences.",1,0

"I'd rather like to see bell curves of income-distribution rather than merely talking about averages. The issue eludes me at large. The grand overall gap between the genders is irrelevant, as (except for this video) the grand biological impact of children is almost always glossed over; and the mother who doesn't (want to) focus on her little bundle of cries and diapers is nothing but a bad parent. Those times are what Social Security Systems/Policies are for. The only real relevant part is: Are you getting the same per hour for the same quality of work? And the opposite is illegal in most civilised countries anyway. If your quality lacks, and therefore you get less than your peers, and that's not enough for you, look for a job that better suits your skillset. A world where everyone is required to work shouldn't exist. That is just a tyrannical exploitative hell.

This is equal in saying that a construction worker should earn on avg the same income as a stock analyst because they are both humans and therefore equally capable of earning the same.
