im mad watching this im a trans guy,NOT
they have male biological traits physically competing with female biological traits hormone therapy has to be completely administered or how long it takes before they can compete on a level playing field  these are males parading as females competing in female track events  how else would you say it  to hell with their feelings  it does not have physical traits ,ABU

absolutely excellent bravo to the filmakers bravo to vegans,NOT

ok real life question but i guess i need some help to understand cant you not be transgender if your a female wanting to be a female but a gay man at the same time isnt that the most like  level of offense like you cannot be trans if you are already the gender you want to be its one thing if she would like to be a man i feel like we would all be supportive but now im so confused like she wants to be transgender as a man but a woman can someone please help me understand honestly i do not want to offend or even judge her i just dont get it,NOT
so more women should enter science and tech cool why arent they and why do they expect the business fields to change working hours for womens needs instead of planning ahead for children and choosing your field accordingly,NOT

i think freelee stole your memory card and will be using it on her channel as her own footage hahaha,NOT
what happend with your instagram i cant find it,NOT
think this vid misses a huge aspect of the gender pay gap  little girls are taught to dress in pink and love unicorns and princessesthen they grow up and are expected to have babies stem subjects arent sexy  no wonder they dont choose them the issue with the pay gap is not just a  of money difference  its a cultural difference and stems from how we raise our girls versus boys,NOT
yessss trish you go girl  im so excited for this d,NOT
i really want someone to see this comment believe it or not the wage gap still exists just not at  cents per dollar after all of those things are taken into consideration there is still a sizable gap of about  cents for every dollar a man makes due to prejudice,NOT
so the case is that the entire concept of a gender wagegap was established from a misinterpretation of a statistic regaring average salary of men and women and some people came to the conclusion that this difference in average salary must be because of discrimination when its really because of differences between how males and females thinkchoose men on average tend to go for the higherpaying jobs and work longer very interesting,NOT
afinal quem  a alma santa que legenda esses videos   valeu cara ,NOT
makes me want a big ribeye,NOT
naomi if you see this comment then i want you to know that i am always right therefore i wasnt wrong about wage gap,NOT
transgender female to man gay drag queen fucking genius,NOT
as a  year old trans man myself i couldnt even make it through the video i felt so hurt and invalidated the pain of dysphoria and knowing my family is secretly annoyed and angry that im bi and trans it sucks trisha is so privileged and doing this just for coin and its gross she needs to stay away and stop fetching minorities,NOT

thaaaaaaaank yoooooouuuuuuu for making this video,NOT
please freelee go check his account hes using animal for his filthy art ,NOT
perhaps you should stop calling it a wage gap and call it an earnings gap and realise that its not a problem that requires fixing if theres a hole in a bucket by all means please fix it if theres a hole in a donut trying to fix it will only destroy it,NOT
yay a plane piss off plane freelee the banana girl  ,NOT

thug kitchen cookbook is the best vegan cookbook ever it has tons of super easy vegan recipes for every meal of the day snacks drinks desserts everything in the book it also tells you all of the basics of cooking and how to cook and it is written with a bunch of swear words and stuff making it super funny i obviously highly recommend it especially the broccoli chickpea burritos which are so good omg,NOT
vegan cheese  vegan meat peanuts  vegan almond milk you can almost by everything vegan  ,NOT
this video is old idk why she decided to put it up now if she been filmed that shes gonna go vegan  yet she never did lol sucha jokster smh,NOT
shes a human who likes to do drag as a male,NOT
why does it feel like everyone on the internet has just forgot that trisha paytas came out as black once,NOT
the gender wage gap is about as real as the flying spaghetti monster anyone who believes in it cant understand how the statistic is calculated,NOT
marriage exists feminists im gonna pretend i didnt see that,NOT
maybe all transsexual woman should stop using transgender to define themself becaus our true specificity is transsexual few years ago i had big fight about those transsexual who wanted to exclude the ones who choose to keep there genitals and named them as transgender but this is not reality being transsexuals is about hormones and not surgery someone who remove the penis does not make this person a transsexual a man whitout a penis still is a man but named eunuch so to remove a sex genitals does not make a transsexual this is the fact and the truth it is only by the hormones that we become a woman and change our body from inside it is the hormones that grow breast and modify our shape so all of those who are on a therapy of hormones to change there gender become transsexuals there is no shame to use this word it doesnt make you a sexworking person using this definition if this is why you choose not to use the real definition transgender is a generic noun to put everything in it even the alien anybody who play with there look by fantasy or anybody who is delusionals about things related to the human state transsexual is a specific noun and only people on hormones can be name like that it exclude all the others and by the way things are going it is better transgender noun is harmfull for us by the way nonbinary and else has use this to put discord in the society by doing so they destroy all the sensibility build by the pioneer from the last  years or more this is what we can observe i am a transsexual woman when some people come to me and ask if i am a transgender i correct that for transsexual becaus this is what i am really and i do not want to be associated to all the crazy people clamed to be transgender them and me are not in the same side we must stop that nonsens,NOT
fuck off you beautiful human youre intelligent and your soul shines through i love the way you speak about people and issues you feel honest and genuine never stop being you,NOT
morning stars breakfast foods are so good try it,NOT
im here for the comments,NOT
i can already feel the backlash of this video,NOT
yes freelee i love this i love the positivity radiating from this video i am looking forward to the content that continues to educate people about how to last on this lifestyle,NOT
am happy for her finally ,NOT
she most likely pre recorded it and posted it when she felt most comfortable going on a planted based vegan diet bc on her snapchat today she bleached her roots and in this video she still has her roots nothing is wrong with pre recording and posting when feeling most comfortable stop hating on trish,NOT
i love how you look so happy in this video freelee ,NOT
her face looks paralyzed too much botox maybe,ABU
if you can try eating tons of veggies especially leafy greens because they have more protein than you would think,NOT
and just like that the pendulum swings facts are in again,NOT
smhgo compete with other boys so unfair,ABU
i call bullshit,ABU
 i had a heart attackwtf choose a different photo or something,NOT
of course they won they are boys with long hair if i were loosing against them id be pissed this is where the left goes off the rails and this is just the beginning they are cheating cheating,ABU
and also yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssss keep up the vegan diet pls ,NOT
thats amazing news,NOT
also this is further insensitive as fuck considering its the anniversary of matthew shepard being brutally murdered for being gay maybe you should keep your mouth shut about things you lnow are going to piss people off for a few days before blurting them out sit on them  think a bit before you gung ho it hurt peoples feelings and then in a few days time change your mind theres a humongous difference between being a fun loving troll and a hurtful piece of shit ,ABU
depends if you consider childrearing damaging to a womans life statisticians concerned with the wage gap will have you believe thats the case,NOT
its kind of suspicious that trisha also lost the footage and was that a freudian slip when she said maybe its for the best that the video got deleted i mean that the file got corrupted,NOT
honestly i think you and trish are very similar you both have strong personalities but inside youre both sweet and both are going through relationship troubles i think you two should give friendship another go and help eachother through this and you can help trish with her vegan transformation and she can help you with collabs she has so many subs and so do you but she could have a bigger voice for the vegan community i see a friendship blossoming already,NOT
isnt everyone trans now a days gender we dont use that word in our safe space it doesnt exist anymore i tell you,NOT
you still have to have a calorie deficit to lose weight eat until you feel satisfied not stuffed then you will lose weight you should try don lee farms vegan burgers they are delish p,NOT
thank you so much the world really needed this,NOT
i was waiting for this,NOT
trisha lmfao im going vegan for a week lol ok,NOT
trisha you should ask joey,NOT
i think if she started making vegan cooking videos and would show all the yummy vegan food there is and if she did loads of other vegan associated videos without targeting anyone i think alot more people would turn vegan i have been thinking about turning vegeterian i eat meat but since im only  and my whole family eats meat it wouldnt be that easy but i really hope that more people will turn vegan or even vegeterian,NOT
oh fuck i always said if trisha paytas goes vegan then i will welp,NOT
so women making less for the same job boils down to choices yet boys getting worse grades in the same class amounts to a rigged system you had a good point until you didnt,NOT
a wage gap is a preferable alternative to communism,NOT
i love trish but i dont think she can last two weeks maybe one,NOT
all you people dancing with joy that the wagegap does not exist and feminists are wrong should rethink this whole situation women dont talk about this because they want the same pay for the same job cause that has been already dealth with and i mean sane women not idiots featured in buzzfeed videos reading the scripts theyre given they just want equal treatment in the workplace that is the problem and the main reason why women are flagging up the disproportion in total earnings of men vs women the inequality exists because of women being expected to engage in the family life more than men that is one of the reasons imo its the biggest factor in todays society success is measured unfortunately but its the truth by how much money you make and how great of a professional career you have it applies to both genders women feel like they will have a tougher time with accomplishing that kind of success than men and it is rightly so most of us men and women want to have children one day but for women having children means that their professional career will take a hit just to make this a bit more real one of my friends asked her boss why her colleague was given a promotion although shes been working for the company for a longer time she left out the fact that hes not as good at his job and the fact that he is a man she didnt expect that would be the reason and the answer was well you have two children at a young age so we thought giving you more responsibility right now could be damaging to your private life fun fact  the guy also has two children at a very similar age of course my friend left that company thank god obviously that inequality is not mens or womens fault its how our society is built but we should look at possibilities of dealing with that problem as increasingly women are just giving up having children completely the ageing society is already a huge issue that is progressing something needs to be done and as of now there are many people  again both male and female  that are not even acknowledging that the problem exists wake up people i tried to stress that no one who is a sane human being is blaming men for this its not all of the men of this planet that should get together to fix this its a problem of the society as a whole and we should try to deal with it thats all,NOT
to be honest idk how you see her content as good she pretty much gives youtubers a bad name is she capable of telling the truth,NOT
i have to show this video to my libtard infested school,NOT
is this prefilmed,NOT
flax milk by the brand good karma,NOT
when trisha got rent due next week,NOT
just a very small point you shouldnt say point seventyseven it is actually point seven seven seventy is seven times ten point seven is seven tenths mathematics grammar nerd signing off,NOT
trisha said shes a drag queen maybe instead shes interested in doing burlesque its all about being glamorous and putting on a show except youre not in drag i think trisha just has some internal issues she needs to work on i cant say i think shes trans,NOT
waiting for freelee to make a video about this,NOT
yay trisha sending encouraging positive vibes,NOT
you only are using trisha for u content your sad and just need views you thirsty and its so sad,NOT
thank you we needed this video a long time ago,NOT
this s so true,NOT
i was about to say i couldnt take more than  minutes of listening to this until i checked and it was only  minutes in,NOT

so now that shes not in the news for exposing the vlog squad now shes moving on to offending the whole lgbtq community she really wants her name in the news doesnt she she really trying the most ,NOT
yes pls do a new what i eat in a day pls,NOT
i think everyone thinks being a vegan is totally strange and people think all u eat are fruits and veggies  which is true but all u literally have to do is swap your usual habits to countless many vegan options  for example you still can have all ur fav junk food baked goods and as well as burgers and such ,NOT
yes trisha slay girl,NOT
sooo the wage gap is only a thing because women generally work less why was this even an issue then,NOT
make sure you eat enough calories,NOT
nope unfair step down transgenders challenge other transgenders done,ABU
so why dont companies only hire women,NOT
you aint a man you a toad,NOT
why is it necessary to explain the obvious its sad that people are so ignorant not to figure it alone,NOT
do they have an unfair advantage  um yes the fact that theyre men lol,ABU
have you lost your mind,NOT
women want the world to change to be easier and more flexible for them while men go and do their job no matter how hard it is this is the attitude that is earning you less money,NOT
my female teacher told me that all female teachers had to sign a contract that included not asking male colleagues about their pay,NOT
lol stolen valour transgender edition,NOT
i support them as being transgender bc it can be hard but it is not far for them to compete with the girls cuz i watched the rd place girls interview and she was devastated and she made valid points and also it is so obvious their guys so common sense would tell u maybe something is off u know i want to hear yalls thoughts bc this is a touchy subject,ABU
guys hear that shes gender fluid too ,NOT
funfact there is no such thing as masculine or feminine energy,NOT
if i ever get arrested i am identified as a woman  jail here i come,NOT
they should let them run but not count there stats,NOT
i actually took the time to read the georgetown university study and can confirm that the data presented in this video is  accurate to explain the  difference  men are more willing to work overtime  women take more time off maternity leave  women are less likely to ask for a raise  other variables,NOT
ok finally nice video but stillwhy women wont chose a higher paid jobs instead ofsocial work psychology education hmmmm,NOT
youre not trans honey youre just a tomboy continuing to just prefer man things over women things and thats fine im the same way as that but i still see myself as a female i just agree that i get on better with male stereotypical things but it doesnt mean you have to say youre transgender,NOT
i was very pleased to see that the documentary has chinese subtitles available it seems to me that it is essencial to disseminate information and seek ways to prevent the expansion of meat consumption in china as the country is very populous and meat industries are increasingly seeking to expand this promising market ill watch it today thanks,NOT
this world will never be vegan but enjoy your life in a cult,NOT
vegans suck dogs balls i hate vegans more than road cyclists in peak hour traffic,ABU
why is this  years old and im only seeing it now and its from vox which ought to be quoted by at least half of news feeds,NOT
so yes there is a wage gap and everybody in disagreement with you only read the title and got right own into the comment section and made some edgy joke about feminism and moved on,NOT
it is naive to think that simply by going vegan will resolve our environmental issues yes it could end animal factory farming but the multinationals will move on to cutting down forests creating gmos and decimating the earth the conversation must include limiting the power of corporationsbut they have the power of american law the presidency and advanced propaganda media at their disposal there is great suffering for mankind ahead only then will we have the will to changegoing vegan anyway,NOT
eat nuts gurl almonds cashews walnuts macadamia nuts etc nuts are great protein and have amazing skin benefits also eat dates great for a raw food to add to any meal,NOT
why are you going directly vegan you should try being vegeterian and then slowly move into being vegan you cant go from binge eating fast food to becoming vegan,NOT
if you want to lose weight just go low fat no matter what you eat,NOT
so essentially men get paid more because they are more able to compete successfully for the difficult requirements of labor in different fields if we are to look to basic economics as a guide it would be more economical for men to specialize in these areas where they possess an advantage and for women to specialize in the areas where they possess an advantage considering the fact that what determines the specialization of the sexes are biological realities it is fairly irrational and uneconomical for women to desire to enter into the workforce in any economy that values efficiency of production,ABU
she should go hard on alot of fruit in the first couple weeks so she can really feel the big energy level increase compared to her previous diet,NOT
green beans peanut butter rice pasta grains nuts,NOT
woman have been asking for equal rights for years and we are supposed to believe that this doesnt place women again behind,NOT
this doesnt make any sense letting to grown men run against high school females thats fair our society is a joke and america needs to wake up,ABU
bean beans bean one of my favorite meals is bean burrito refried beans make sure you get low fat and some have lard read ingredients with tomato and avoca and oat meal with coconut sugar and fruit eat carbs dm me on insta at  for recipes,NOT
the one thing im confused about is that some days i really hate my body and want to not have boobs and be flat and have a penis and just be a guy but i know im not trans i do like being a girl but i also do want and like looking and acting more masculine and even have the features as a guy idk i wish i had a character making hud for me where i can just change my gender whenever i wanted  can some one help me explain how i feel,NOT
im so happy for you,NOT
its a myth if girls were truly paid less buisnesses would hire only women bc they would have to pay less,NOT
there is a form of drag that women do theres a word for it but i cant remember i love drag ijust do,NOT
take that dumb english teacher,NOT
youre going to need to eat some veggies girl i know ur against them but its very good for you you should add them in smoothies and juices so you cant barley even taste them,NOT
wanting to swap from looking like a male or female does not make you trans,NOT
also trisha you do realize that your body is not gonna change in  weeks its a longterm thing,NOT
so much for that right,NOT
do people understand that you can just be yourself and maybe that means u like to hang out with men more than women or you like to dress a certain way doesnt always have to mean youre transgender or some other label chill out,NOT
hey klaus and team outstanding thank you very much indeed keep up the amazing work,NOT
pls read this lol it may be helpful make sure you take vitamin b and get all the nutrients you need and youre probably gonna get cravings most people do at the beginning of their journey especially knowing you hehe so i recommend getting fake meat products such as gardein products theyre soooo yummy and make your cravings dissapear eat lots of beans and spinach and get yummy coconut milk ice cream or sorbet stuff its my favourite fucken thing and ugh just yummmmm and also its not an easy change its huge and takes commitment but if you stick with it you wonttttt regret it dont be afraid to eat a chicken nugget every once in a blue moon if thats what youre really craving cutting yourself off completely at all times especially when you first start out may just make you resent the vegan diet even morefor some people its better to just go cold turkeyor tofurkey in this caseand thats cool too youre still making a huge difference with this choice and im so happyyyy,NOT
these are not girls they are males their chromosomes confirmed that this is sexual perversion and these guys cant compete against males this is wrong and against all common sense and god,ABU
so essentially the gap does not exist thanks for a misleading video,NOT
omg trish whattt,NOT
my god the like to dislike ratio is actually insane,NOT
women are like  well why dont the men take care of the kids well if you let us take care of the kids you dont want us taking care of the kids ,NOT
wagegap statistics is what you get when you are a horrible scientist and dont know how to control for factors,NOT
i get what youre saying but i think the wage gap argument is meant to be broader than what you are talking about in the video the gap is not  cents big but there is still a gap i am not saying women and men have to do every occupation  but the choices women make in terms of going to lower paying jobs is partly due to some sexism in the workplace and society at large a women might want to go into aerospace engineering for example but if she is geared from a young age to play with dolls and take care of things she will slowly go into that career path also the idea of going into a field with mostly men will be daunting because their definitley still is sexism in the workplace guys can easily become friends with one another and move up while a girl in an office full of boys will probably have a hard time playing her chess moves and moving up it is all these little things the wage gap conversation is about its not only about the  cents argument because that is not correct but more so about the extra hurdles women face in the workplace combined this with that fact women have the abilty to get pregnant and deal wiht childcaring makes matters more complex and will affect thier pay,NOT
ive only been vegan for a few months but if you feel like your gonna cave because that can definitely happen starting out theres so many good vegan junk food options obviously not heathy but its good af if you feel like you might cave you could try the ben  jerrys dairy free ice cream literally tastes the same as regular oreos gardien vegan meats so good and even taco bell just replace meat for beans no cheese or sour cream and add guac or rice if you want hope this was helpful love your videos trish ,NOT
i really wish youtube had an i agree a  because the like just is not enough,NOT
ive been vegan for almost six years now i suggest to watch the slaughterhouse videoes anytime you crave meat until its just not food to you anymore it works a vegan diet can be very healthy but compassion is the best veganiser im really glad youre giving it a go and wish you the best veggie burgers are great rice beans spaghetti quinoa veggies seeds etc ,NOT
well now there is man are paid less than women,NOT
it says that you watched it ,NOT
it would just push me to run faster  what an ignorant reply this is totally unfair and they know it,NOT
another way to close the wage gap across the board is to have both parents take on a more equal share of domestic responsibilities,NOT
here are some more stats  according to the glassceiling index featured in economist magazine women on company boards in us during  are less than  and women in managerial positions in us are at about  according to an article in us news data approx  of american women were getting their mba in  having children does play a part for women as well as working round the clock for men but this paradigm is not healthy for all involved including the corporations who have a group of overly tired and stretched out employees on their payroll,NOT
chipotle has vegan options noodles and company and i live at whole foods they have everything you want in a vegan version that you could imagine these things can really help with starting out vegan,NOT
its like gold plated vs gold just because something is dressed up in gold doesnt mean its gold through and through they should be ashamed of themselves,ABU
they failed as parents,NOT
no it is what they did they entered the womens while biologically male cease,ABU
k but the wage gap doesnt exist first of all its illegal to have the wage gap going do to a law made in the s second of all if the wage gap did exist then only women would be working this information doesnt account for sick days or maternity leave just the raw income,NOT
the well being of the child the parents say how about getting your child mental health help because that kid is gonna grow up in sexual confusion for the rest of their life they will be messed up mentally and have a higher rate of depression and suicide rates as per medical stats,ABU
why do the vast majority of people who claim that the wage gap doesnt exist never show any evidence to back up their claims,NOT
if youre starting out make sure you eat enough calories eatdrink fruit smoothies in the morning then for lunch eat a high carb satisfying meal rice pasta beans potatoes dont starve yourself because then youll get discouraged and not do the vegan diet right do not starve yourself youre going to do great ,NOT
whats a crow mukbang,NOT
before you watch the video the wage gap doesnt exist,NOT
why should i care about people making the top  incomes in the united states,NOT
this is sick i cannot even believe thee young ladies have to suffer because two teenage boys are confused about their identities thus stealing there chances at obtaining scholarships this has got to stop and transgenders should start their own league,ABU
who else was shocked about trisha going vegan ,NOT
i was vegan for yrs but when my friend offer me a double whooper beef burger with lettuce and tomatoesi will never going back vegani was planning to make channel for diy bbq beefpork and chicken to add on sandwich burger,NOT
a lot less biased than i expected,NOT
i wanna sign the petition where is it,NOT
first one i watched and loved it my daughter and niece highly recommended your channel i subscribed within the first few minutes watching have a great day ,NOT
vegan doesnt mean healthy  sustainable  theres just a lil bit more to it  and yes iam whole foods plant based no processed foods  everyone needs to find his own way  theres no reason to force anyone into something being open for new things is key trying things out for ya health for mothernature for the animals getinspired,NOT

what do people miss about the gender pay gap that there isnt one,NOT
its so nice to see everyone being so supportive,NOT
why are transgenders being promoted so much because of another transgender michael michelle obama sports should have a transgender division let transgenders compete against other transgenders,NOT
hi freelee i have been vegetarian since i was eleven years old always with a keen disinterest in the taste of meat i recently decided i would go vegan and began exclusively eating a plant based diet but despite feeling good i found i was losing too much weight i wasnt big to begin with so the weight loss was dramatic ive turned back to dairy and eggs as a dense calorie source but id like to continue the transitionthough unsure how to expand my stomach enough to accommodate the volume of fruits and veg required to maintain a healthy weight i hoped you could address this in a future video also i struggle slightly with the idea of consuming as many calories as an obese person or person eating for two and not with the fear of gaining weight but with the knowledge that our planet has limited resources and in  billion if half of us are eating for two wouldnt that seem closer to  and a deeper strain on the enviroment any thought you have on this topic would be great thank you ,NOT
check out rawvanna or fully raw,NOT
black and transgender must be the mooooost difficult subject in confused america,NOT
wow long time not see you i came just for your new drama attention hahahahha and all i can say you look skinny,NOT

dont give up the bacon trish lol,NOT
nearly  years vegetarian and  years plant based no going back sadly though fukushima nuclear coverup is killing the planetnothing in the news about mass starvation of all life in the pacific ocean because of radioactive poisoning,NOT
you think this is a godd explanation but there is alot of info you leave oute that idont know  when you say men get  and wimmen get  but you need more info than that edjucation like you state  is this per houer or at the end of the year then if men work  houers in a set time and wimmen work  houers i that same set time is this gap not fair  now i dont know the stats but the fair way of paying someone is not by the houer but by the work so if men does more work in less time but work the same time as wimmen it is only logical that men gets more if they get more work done same if wimmen does more wokr is the same time that men do then wimmen must get more i wil only cal it equalety when someone can say that wimmen and men get the same kind of money for moving this bag of stuf from point a to point b no matter the time it takes you get a set amount of money when the work is done this is fair and until someone can say that men get more for the same job that took the same amount of time if they then get more then the system is not fair then it is fair to pay the guy more if he does it faster depending on the job cus sometimes if you does something a litle slower take your workd and deliver it to someone that then have to do work on it the slower eatch point in the cahain is the slower the total work is done,NOT
eat more carbs just eating the fruit you have bought will definitely not keep you vegan for long because you will be craving more fats and carbs pasta rice lentils etc love you trish so proud of you,NOT
im so glad trisha is going vegan,NOT
it is time for pray for vegan world,NOT
she looks like a rhino crossed with a toad hit in the face,ABU
did vox read the study they posted in their description the study states that  of the wage gap of mbas is a result of differences in mba courses taken and gpa differences in career interpretations and weekly hours worked that reduces the wage game to  a direct quote from the study fifteen years after obtaining their ba women who earned an mba had the lowest labor force participate rate the lowest share working full time and full year and took the greatest amount of noneducational time off from employment compared with others having professional degrees and phds vox if you want to discuss the wage gap and present your view on it then at least reference a source that supports your view and not one that opposes it,NOT
i would really like a way to find your sources please,NOT
we need more women lion tamers,NOT

liar liar pants on fire  the opposite is true check allan savory ted talk animals are building soil and saving the environment check garland farms the vegan death cult plant crops are killing the environment pesticides are needed and killing nature if you want to talk about the morel aspect killing and eating  cow a year is far less than the thousands of animals you indirectly kill for growing plants think about it,NOT
omg what a troll hahaha ok trish and i identity as a cardigan sweater ,NOT
so yesterday i was discussing this subject with my girlfriend and i explained all of this but even though she agreed she came up with an argument i found difficult to refute even if you consider same jobs same position working hours and total time working at a company companies ran by elder males tend to favor career ascension to men instead of women therefore making them earn more mainly because they still live in the past and as a man i have to say ive heard about these cases maybe they dont provide an overall big gender gap but they are a reality thoughts on this,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist,NOT
your an idiot,ABU
well according to the bureau of labor women earn less than men in jobs female dominated male dominated and gender equal just saying,NOT
if you just identify as a male u arent trans bcs trans means that ur transitioning from like female to male or male to female so like in my opinion u just as u said u just identify as a male and arent trans so like why do u say i am transgender please tell me if i said something wrong cuz english aint my first language lol,NOT
this is so good girl yes  youre going to do great and feel so good,NOT
 wtf theres still a gap though,NOT
so i get why this video will offend peoplebut i thought the lbgt community was all about people exploring their identity yeah she might only be doing this for views but you cant assume other peoples motives shes just trying to explain her identity but i will admit that the title is not on,NOT
i swear this part of youtube is always entertaining,NOT
eat lots of beans potatoes rice pasta greens fruit and berries,NOT
alexa play the man by taylor swift,NOT
yey really cool that you want to try the vegan lifestyle hope you continue after these two weeks buy beans and rice thats a super good start cook beans and rice with vegetables so simple and cheap but soooo good ,NOT
no matter what the gap still exists at some extent its still an issue just not nearly as bad as some people make it look,NOT
cauliflower buffalo wings are actually really good xd,NOT
most women go to collegemost men dont go to college it take a lot to go to college then youre in debt,NOT
no offence to trisha but its so difficult to understand her to me this is almost her normal self because its happened so so many times,NOT
if a man makes k and a woman makes k thats not  less thats  less maybe the gap can be partly explained by men being better at arithmetic and english,NOT
we also saw how well that worked out on snapchat ,NOT
okay ill honest here i thought there was a gender gap in wages but never dug into the matter as im only a student yet and it wasnt a present issue for me i did suspect there was some bias in the mens one dollar womens  cents statement and im glad i found this video because it confirmed my suspect and changed my overall opinion on the whole gender wage gap matter ill dig into this more i just hope this video and her university are valid sources,NOT
if trish is going vegan i am too,NOT
is society trying to pretend that tomboys dont exist or have we simply forgotten people who say that they are nonbinary or insert obscure gender here are so weird because gender presentation  physical sex and personality  gender presentation theres nothing wrong with not being masculine or feminine but it seems as though people are just trying to gain oppression points by making up genders trans people people who are actually trans and not just transtrenders are valid because they have an actual health condition their transgenderness is vindicated by science but the trans community needs to practice gatekeeping any trans person needs to have doctoral proof that they have the medical condition,ABU
at least they got a woman to talk about this if they got a guy to do it the feminists would have swarmed this video like an fbi raid,NOT
i cant be the only one who notices that the only people who say the wage gap doesnt exist is men,NOT
as being a vegan you cant eat anything that deals with animals on land and sea  milk eggs or honey for breakfast you can have bagel with vegan cream cheese toast with jelly pancakes fruit smoothie tofu scramble with veggie sausage fruitfilled toaster pastry and for lunchdinner veggie burger or hot dog with fries mock lunchmeat sandwich with chips faux meat with baked or mashed potatoes and gravy vegetable stirfry with tempeh tofu or seitan falafel pita sandwich with hummus or tabouli peanut butter and jelly sandwich i have a lot of recipes you can try if you want to contact me,NOT
people dont have to understand for you to be valid i hope you dont take the ignorant comments on this video to heart much love and keep doing what makes you happy ,NOT
boys are boys girls are girls thats it in the pro sports world athletes get tested for all kinds of substances that give a person an advantage so why is it boys that claim to be girls be any different complete garbage,ABU
so proud of you go trisha yaaaas,NOT
good for you whether its  weeks or life its still something also your makeup is so pretty ,NOT
thanks plant based news  you guys are the best ,NOT
hey freelee i want to thank you for being the awesome person you are and helping to help me with my eating ways i am a  years old and i am a pescatarian i come from a meat eating family who already is skeptical about my eating ways i do so badly want to become a vegan but i dont think i would supported the only support i would probably get would be from youtube if you have any advice please help me,NOT
i wouldnt tell people to not watch those documentaries theyre eye opening im so glad youre going vegan even if its only for a couple weeks but remember that you can always find vegan alternatives for your favourite foods,NOT
i have to say im happy to see a middleleft leaning formerly very left leaning outlet like vox talking about what the actual controlled numbers say about the earnings gap instead of just parroting the woefully inadequate statistic women only make  on the dollar to men way to be more objective and take a deeper dive for the truth then many others ive seen,NOT
this makes me so happy i love you trish ,NOT
thank you but i have to lolz at the fact that they had to make a woman covered this story to prevent ppl from just screaming sexist pigs,NOT
you shouldnt be worried about over eating you really need to make sure you get all the vitamins and nutrients that youd normally get in dairy and meats such as proteins and vitamin b i recommend getting some nutoatsoya milk with no added sugar and also non dairy butter to make the diet easier also make lots of lentilpulse soups which are really yummy and filling good luck,NOT
this is ridiculous and really unfair to the other competitors just make an alltrans sports league or something,ABU
omg not another one,NOT
im a retired history teacher when we covered the modern feminist movement i would debunk the wage gap for my students later in the course i would have them pick a social issue facing women today describe the problem and propose a solution a significant percentage of them generally around  would write their paper on the wage gap,NOT
dont forget women that choose career over family are more likely to be depressed,NOT
this is just satisfying,NOT
omg trish yayayayayay ur so cuteeeeeee and omg omg omg tahnk thank uuuu uthank uuu uyaayayyaya,NOT
her video honestly was embarrassing these sorts of people really need to stop making such a joke of the lgbtq community these days its seriously just for attention for some people and its a slap in the face for people who have actually struggled with things like coming out and figuring yourself out which i have personally done go get help trisha jesus christ,ABU
i think trisha is just confused in general shes addicted to pills shes done coke and meth and she drinks drinking isnt that bad but she said she binge drinks which isnt normal or healthy behavior the concoction of shit shes on is probably messing with her chemical balances in her head and she is trying to rationalize how she feels but trying to identify a certain way it isnt right and im not defending her its just way deeper than being trans i dont think she even understands what it means im not trans but i understand what trans people go through and how they dont feel like theyre in the right body trisha doesnt seem to have a problem with that shes just confused her video was bizarre and i wonder if she was high on pills in a lot of her crazy rambling videos shes high so i dont see this as making any kind of sense lol,NOT
two transgendered girls bahahahaha ,NOT
theres a reason why conservatives are on the right wing because we are right,NOT
if women want to close the wage gap become educated in more valuable vocations work as many hours as the highest earning men and dont have children just like how men have no guarantee to have children its solved now do it and stop complaining,NOT

this is only sensitive in americanot in other countries where common sense is still a thing,NOT
trisha is as stupid as she looks,ABU
transgenderism is an avenue for satan to try and manipulate people to accept lies as truth dude i dont care what yall say im going with the word of god that says he created them male and female is evidence by the body part she gave to you wicked hypocrites you claim that you believe in science and you need evidence but all of a sudden i dude says there are growing you set the need for evidence aside extra extra read all about jesus i identify with jesus christ and i will not bow down to the throne of the devil you are doing an order to embrace transgenderism with all thats evil manipulations jesus christ forgive us jesus christ help us jesus christ moving divine power against these satanic strongholds,ABU
i think a big part of closing the wage gap is going to be empowering men to be the primary caregivers of children,NOT
we as adults are making this worse by letting them get away with this i need your asses whipped and explain to them why they are boys and how boys act obviously they had no role models  base their actions on and this is what you get should we start playing along with schizos and talk to the voices in her head with them or play along with bipolars or people that can see ghosts and talk to the ghost with them or there imaginary friends where the fuck does it stop,ABU
i enjoy watching your videos i just hope you know this is difficult to achieve maybe your just dieting but going vegan means a lot more than what you eat balenciaga handbag unboxing video is not vegan friendly,NOT
australian news is the worst they are still saying there is a pay gap,NOT
for god sake im not here to inviladate your feelings but this chick clearly is just tryna get views and clickbait people this is the reason the lgbt community isnt taken seriously she thinks theythem pronouns are confusing but shes somehow transgender that shit confusing as much as wrong as someone who identifies as part of the lgbt community this just makes me angry having boobs doesnt mean you identify as a thicc boy it means your a fucking girl you cant choose your gender your gender is something you so strongly know your are you cant identify with your born gender and be transgender you can be genderfluid and feel like other genders but that doesnt make you transgender fuck this world is getting fucked up,ABU
dont forget to block sorsha,NOT
ok but why does it have to be a gay man why cant you be with a bi or pan people tf,NOT
see all we need to do to fix the wage gap is make work more accommodating for women ,NOT
i went vegan  months ago and im feeling great so far for protein source i see a medium sized fruit as a g source of protein so thats how i count but i also eat boiled potatoes mashed with brocolli steamed spinach sides of mushrooms peas and olives and shit like that i also have an app called cronometer that sort of trains me to eat enough and gives me clues on how to eat thats how i try to make sure to get like around g of protein a day,NOT
wanna go vegan but my parents wont let me,NOT
tbh she lost me during the video she jumped between too many things from what i saw she didnt explain about how the waige gap is calculated she didnt explain how ment tend to work overtime women on average work  hour weeks while men work about  hour weeks if you divide the numbers women roughly work  of the time now if we calculate time taken off for child care vacations ect women will work far less than men not including the overtime men work she also didnt talk about how women tend to choose lower paying jobs and fields than men theres another huge factor,NOT
gardein products are great especially as you transition and might struggle to come up with meal ideas you can not eat as many calories as you want ive found that to be very misleading in this community use an online calorie calculator to get a general idea of what you should be eating or better yet get your rmr tested and know for sure how many calories your body burns at rest still pay attention to your macros at each meal nothing crazy just try to include a healthy protein at each meal this is what has worked for me youll get  different answers but youll have to tweak it to find what works best for you ,NOT
doing this along with her dancing  her body is going to look so great and shes going to feel so much better,NOT
yassss i commented on her video saying i hope you drag her,NOT
im so proud of both of you thank you for inspiring her i love her for doing this im so happy lol,NOT
the ad i got for this video was a video saying that woman that join prostitution dont have a choice i would argue differently and i hope prageru would too,NOT
why do you hate women raising the children,NOT
she has tried to say she is black a trump supporter religious a lesbian bisexual and now a trans man  ftm all of which have been retracted or presumed retracted based on anti religious homophobic racist and transphobic comments theres only one consistent thing about trisha paytas she is an attention seeking mess and i thoroughly believe she has histrionic personality disorder,NOT

yaaaaas she watches kalelllllll im so proud of you trish,NOT
proof that some people are attempting to gaslight others,NOT
now this is an intelligent human being,NOT
title there is no gender wage gap goes on to talk about how there is in fact a gender wage gap but dont worry if you make good choices then you can shrink it all the way down to a  cent difference which essentially means that even if you play your cards right you will be paid  percent less if youre a woman than if youre a man also want to point out how this lady goes and talks in a video about how bad boys are doing in school and getting worse grades than girls mainly because they spend too much time outside and therefore we need to change the system so that it can benefit them basically when it comes to girls its their job to adjust their choices to adapt to a system clearly built against them but when it comes to boys its the opposite since even though their poor performance in school is solely due to their own decisions we must change the system to benefit them yeah these guys basically just tell rightwing people what they want to hear friendly reminder that prager u is predominately funded by an oil tycoon and then comes out with a video called why you should love fossil fuels,NOT
these dumb triggered feminist need to stop talking about the wage gapthere is literally a law that you can not pay someone less based on there sexraceand religion,NOT
your so awsome for this video even if its only for  weeks i am very proud of you and honestly you dont only have to eat fruit you can eat sooooo many other things just a tip and dont worry about calories if you are going to be eating healthy foods,NOT
maybe she is posting it now because its taken this long to finally make the decision its a big decision,NOT
lack of education and ignorance led to her making that video also attention seeking trolling and just general fuckery,NOT
this must be very difficult for the students who want to support their friends but clearly understand how this is unfair,NOT
it is bullshit and wrong,NOT
i love meat,NOT
ive never said anything rude or hateful on any of your videos but this is really low just for some coin,NOT
i guess the wage gap as represented here not caused by active discrimination but work time choices does exist between the sexes i just dont understand why it is always put into the perspective of sexist discrimination i wouldnt deny there to be still some issues with that but just concentrating on this factual wage gap here i do not see why it is seen as such an important cause to close it by force as presented here it seems that the wage gap is mainly caused by the division of parenting tasks partners choose in which women still often do more of the unpaid work at home and therefore earn less careerwise surely our society will change so i guess work at home will be seperated more equally and i dont think this is a bad trend as it promotes egalitarian principles and so on this however is a cultural issue as this wage gap is mainly based on this choices and not structual discrimination its comparable with the single mom single dad ratio maybe yes there are essentially more single moms than dads and maybe it would be nicer to have this more equally but it is not due to discrimination of men but rather because of the still existing sex models children stay with their moms so it would be nice to dicuss this topics without always putting things as discriminative,NOT
finally have some yummy rice beans potatoes lentils pasta lots of veggies and fruits stay away from liquid fats such as oils dont forget to consume plenty of water to stay hydrated also since youre transitioning maybe try some vegan meat alternatives to be able to adjust easier im so glad you are changing your eating habits you will be so much healthier and happier love you trish we want whats best for you and this is an amazing choice youre making,NOT
honestly shes just traumatized by being sexualizised by men and fetishizes gay men so  therapy for her ig,NOT
way to go trish welcome to the family dont be scared to eat like ten times what you showed in the video in a day try hummus or olive tapenade or tofu spread to dip your carrots in too and for cooked food potatoes with mock meat of some sort is an awesome option gardein has a whole range in the freezer section of most north american supermarkets and i swear you can hardly tell it isnt meat most of all enjoy the plenitude eat all you want and you will guaranteed not gain weight ,NOT
 triggered femininsts who dont like facts disliked,NOT
girl what are you smoking,ABU
trish what youre saying is legit that you prefer guys as friends and u can appreciate beauty in both men and women and you have a specific type with regards to you being a man youre just convincing urself u are coz of u getting bullied seriously think about what youre saying coz i know you dont mean to but you are sooo misunderstanding the terms you mean so plz just chill and check yo self tbh x,NOT

this bitch got me fucked up,ABU
because of you freelee im a  year old vegan,NOT
just because you dont like girly things doesnt mean youre trans just because you didnt like grown men staring at your boobs doest mean youre trans just because you dont like a role of women and want to be the man and the assertive one doesnt mean youre trans its okay to not conform to gender roles and still identify as your birthsex it really seem like everyone be forgetting that,NOT

the myth comes from not understanding a basic statistic,NOT
if you eat enough carbs from whole foods im sure youll be fine its really enjoyable eating potatoes rice and even pasta abundantly,NOT
the title is so misleading though you concede in the video that there is actually a gender pay gap you still opted to title the video in a way that explicitly suggests that theres no wage gap what a way to deceptively push your narrative as for reasoning that no one knows for sure why theres a pay gap perhaps you shouldve brought up the various studies in one of which they handed out fictitious resumes with the only difference being that one was named john a boy name whilst the other was named jennifer a girl name it found that not only was the man rated more favorably but that he was offered  more than the female candidate i dont know about you but i believe thats gender discrimination right there,NOT
exactly if i could hire someelse to do the job for less i would right now wages are my biggest expense,NOT
why is she still talking about jason i thought she was over him lol ugly bitch,ABU
awesome trish i hope you stick with it ive been vegetarian for  years now and i really want to switch over to veganism it was so funny to see you say mmm mmm when u were eating that grape as opposed to the usual fast greesy foods that i enjoy as well it was just funny lol,NOT
she does all this for shock value i dont believe her for a second what does not wearing makeup have to do with being transgender being attracted to gay men shes being sexist and down grading the transgender community,NOT
i liked the explanation but think she should have included why the wage gap in the tech field is almost non existent as she said it has a lot to do with hours of availability and with many jobs in the tech field having the option to wfh at least part of the time it saves trips into the office i found wfh is great as long as you make sure to get out and do something during the day as well it doesnt really matter what just as long as one makes sure to leave home for a while otherwise motivation burnout begins to set in,NOT
why all the dislikes,NOT
shes got bpd and most likely going through an identity crisis ,NOT
i dont personally believe it but i really dont feel like its up for discussion people fail to realize not everything is black and white on the internet maybe shes telling the truth maybe she isnt maybe she doesnt understand what shes talking about sometimes i feel its better to sit on the fence for this one,NOT
 a year im going to business school,NOT
so the wage gap exist but not because the world is sexist or patriarchal but because women are usually the one who takes care of the childrens and that effect the wage  someone please tell that to those sjw liberals and fake feminist who hate men,NOT
i agree with this and if it is true then a law requiring men and women to be paid the same for the same qualifications and work should not be a problem,NOT
its sad that there are dislikes on the video and its not cause someone tries to be an edgy troll really sad people who are disliking it ,NOT
i think i understood geometry more than this ,NOT

i hope you know that if you have too many fruits all the sugar in the fruits can result to diabetes my moms co worker was pregnant and all she ate was fruits nonstop and she went to the doctor and he asked if she ate a lot of fruit and when she said yea he told to completely stop eating them because all of the fruits had sugars that gave here diabetes so too much of a good thing is never a good thing,NOT
how about google paying woman more then men didnt talk about that,NOT

one says to oneself how do i get the attention on me hmmm take the mickey out of the transgenderlgbtq community getalife,ABU
nobody let freelee watch the secret life of pets,NOT
none of this is new,NOT
one of the most ignorant videos ive come across this argument is incomplete and the explanation is fragmented this video tries to propagate the lie that gender wage gap is due to individual choice lets take responsibility for the sexism that discourages occupational mobility do women choose to have lower paying jobs recognize that opportunities for men and women are not equal which is reflected in the wage gap women are limited in the kind of jobs they can access because of access barriers in both education and employment tests are designed to be more difficult for women than men attitudinal barriers about gender roles prevent job mobility this video conveniently doesnt address systemic problems of oppression that affect the opportunities available to women,NOT
i completely get what you mean drag queen vibes,NOT
im going vegan babe i hope the products your using right now arent being tested on animalsbecause if they are you might want to change that and buy different products not hating just some advice,NOT
i dont care what people say fuck you freaks of society are drama queens social media at its best,NOT
why focus on the jobs and not the lack of male parenting,NOT
dont call it a gender wage gap to mislead people just call it different life choices earnings gap,NOT
the key to being vegan is eating enough calories grains nuts oils if youre only eating fruit youll be really hungry and crave junk food and are more likely to eat not vegan food also if youre only eating fruit youll be putting nothing but sugar and vitamins in your body and youll have no energy,NOT
women are successful in school men are successful at life,NOT
would have been awesome if she freelee went to vegan without a pay off but nonetheless she has committed to trying it guess thats all that matters ,NOT
it helps to go veagn when you dont restrict yourself tojust healthy foods try the vegan chicken tenders and yhings like that it helps you see that its not that difficult also she lives in california so thatll help i think,NOT
the only tip i can give you is that in regards to gaining weight is lower the intake in sugar also not all sugars a vegan but regardless sugar is s big issues for new vegans who want to lose weight they think because it had not animal products which isnt always true its healthy but sugar is a weight gainer for sure you can have sugar but try to stay away from vegan desserts its filled with sugar for the most part to make it taste good,NOT
how to debunk the wage gap  fail to debunk the fact that an actual gap exists  imply that the smaller gap is no big deal  give explanations for why the gap still exists that were already controlled for in studies   therefore the wage gap doesnt exist brilliant,NOT
 the year i became vegan best year ever,NOT
spinach and vegan cheese quessadias smoothies oatmeal fruit nut treats so many things go on pintrest get delicious recipes,NOT
yay trish welcome to the club just make sure you eat enough of course carb up watch some of free lees what i eat on a day videos,NOT
good for you girl always remember that veganism isnt a quick fix and that if you stick to it long term youll have that amazing body and health forever  sending you my support ,NOT
you already admitted that when you control for all the factors you listed there is still a wage gap you just proved that the wage gap exists and that its not explainable in economic terms you also left out institutional barriers to working in higher paid positions the argument that businesses would higher more women if the wage gap existed ignore that if women are viewed as being less valuable then they will be paid less,NOT

freelees cute grin when trisha mentioned her aww,NOT

 michael says leaving parents wondering if they have an unfair advantage wondering there are only two sexes and there are binary immutable and biological differences between them what is there to wonder about why do so many deny science why are so many offended by truth,NOT
yaaaay trish i am so proud of you okay so remember that you can eat as much as you wantdont over stuff yourself though but try to keep it whole plant based food becuase the processed stuff is generally not the healthiest thing for you just because its vegan does not make it healthy try adding more satiating carby foods like potatoes rice etc fundamentally looking at our basic animal cell these cells get their energy from carbs so dont be scared if you need motivation or more reminders as to why this life is an amazing choice i recommend watching cowspiracy not gory or anything like that but very informative and inspiring good luck babe i promise you will love it xoxo ps google how to veganize starbucks if you catch cravings,NOT

earnings gap not wage gap earning key words here vox,NOT
doesnt this mean that there really isnt a wage gap in the sense that its not a gendered bias towards men in the workforce its just that traditionally women spend more time in the home thus redirecting their efforts towards emotional gain instead of financial gain,NOT
lol  political correctness it is just easy to spot difference but leftists are denying women are working less hours are not strong in many jobs like oil industry it is just so stupid to do the math while every men can use muscles to move furniture from van to house  not women ,ABU
but why not work towards more equal division of labor in childcare obviously theres no institutional way to do that but it seems much more effective than flexibility in hours that isnt even feasible in many fields,NOT
beans rice water make sure to flush your body from the toxins potatoes are always an amazing staple so proud of you trisha,NOT
every woman i know who talks about the wage gap hasnt even attempted research outside of buzzfeed on it,NOT
this video is right,NOT
well once you said you were a lesbian  a few days later your talking about guys again now your transgender then your a drag queen stop using labels on yourself because you have a passing thought its very disrespectful to the community who really have went thru the struggle i use to love you and thought you were hilarious but this just topped off the true ignorant person you are,ABU
best vid of the year ,NOT
 year vegan here thank you and thank you to all of you who are starting its a beautiful journey,NOT
funny how everyone is for it then this crap happens lol men are generally strongerfaster than femalesit is science not sexism,NOT
i think we also need to talk about how no matter what though there is always a slight gap when comparing women and men even with every variable controlled not as high as the base gap but there always is one that put men ahead,NOT
he wrote what economists were saying in the s,NOT
of course they have an unfair advantage theres nothing to wonder about,NOT
sowhy didnt you include other factors such as  men on average work  hours more a week them women  men on average work more overtime or stay late  men take less time off  men are much more likely to ask for a promotionraise also i like how you kinda glossed over the fact that women get pregnantbut ya thats a thing a pretty major one at that,NOT
u really want attention huh,NOT
and the father is just as pathetic with a pretty selfish response,NOT
non binary is a fad omg thank you ffs dont come for me ,NOT
they are not brave or female,ABU
i think the saddest thing about this is when she uploaded the video as troy i knew something like this was coming i literally have figured out her pattern and its heartbreaking af fr,NOT
i was waiting for her to say sike the whole time,NOT
men work harder get a higher job,NOT
guardian chicken strips are the shit,NOT
trisha trolling is fine but ffs leave trans men alone leave trans women alone people who are trans are literally at risk of being murdered because of their identity please stop,NOT
veganismplantbased eating is the only thing that makes sense for health and specity humanity  all living species but to use the climatefanaticism in this is a big mistake as there is not humancaused cobased climate problem worth talking about  we could talk about pollution  all the shit that does not include co  and which seems to have been forgotten completely in the cofrenzy that is a huge problem co is a greenhouse gas in the sense that it makes everything grow faster ask anybody with a professional greenhouse operation and hence greening the planet  but since it is heavier than air  and always will fall down ever heard about gravity  and cannot hold heat it does not cause any traditional greenhouse effect when the grand solar minimum is cooling the planet dangerously and the whole global warming thing is debunked finally  it may take the whole vegan movement with it  which would be a disaster for the reasons mentioned above,NOT
oh my god shut up,NOT
sorry but she is the reason why crack head siblings should not have kids,ABU
at first i found her video hilarious but then i got a migraine see im ftm myself and in the past ive watched trishas videos but only the ones where she hung out with other youtubers like shane dawson jeffree star etc that being said i never thought she was a bad person just a bit on the dramatic side now when i first viewed her video i was like crylaughing choking on my drink and shit but when i really began thinking and began seeing others getting offended by it i rewatched it i can see why everyones flipping shit trisha is literally using the transgender community to stay relevant because showing her tits on camera as a  year old woman is not working for her anymore thats thats bullshit i remembered all the shit i had to through just to get to wear boxers or a binder or cut my hair etc and the shit that i still do go through being a freshman in high school class of  aint lookin too openminded yikes and that got me thinking what the fuck like shes making us look worse the transgender community is already a hailstorm essentially but shes really dragging us through the mud her apology video wasnt even an apology like most youtuber apologies it was just a video of her trying to defend herself and make herself look like the victim i suggest you view that next sis but bring asprin she drags us through the mud but when we knock her ass down into the puddle she dragged us through she cries about it shes almost  and i think she needs to get the fuck off the platform really shes mistaking a midlife crisis for a gender identity dilemma luv u blaire you always do such great reactions and youre hella good at debating people and explaining situations youre and this is gonna sound weird as hell my favorite rightsider on youtube  keep doin what you do  sincerely that one dumbass kid who stays up way too late on pure caffeine alone,ABU
you make it sound like a mother spending time for her kid is obligatory they choose to do it,NOT
you need to react to her newest video and hopefully give her some tips for if she wants to go vegan again,NOT
i love the truth great job again christina,NOT
i love that the thumbnail was her dressed as shane,NOT
also im and always have been a tob boy but im not gay or even trans lol im jus a tom boy,NOT
i feel so amazing after watching this and being a part of the movement for over one year now even if were not done yet  theres still so much to do so many eyes that have to be opened its the best decision i ever made i wish i could share this feeling with everyone hugs to all of you vegans and vegans to be ,NOT
why are you saying that being natural and not putting on makeup or doing your hair is not girly and more of a guy thing,NOT
 so shes saying that the fact that there is a six cent bias of sexism is fine i cant believe a woman would say that wtf,NOT
ive been a mostly raw vegan for   months ,NOT
oooh you hatin on herhim whatever tf you are who tf cares i get what heshes sayin duh just leave the children and babies out of your sik af satanic luciferian occult rituals okay stop trying to indoctrinate the people and the innocent children okay and stop making them strip and pole dance okay you freakin disgusting sodomites from hell i luv your channel btw i think that youre a beautiful open transperson and appreciate your commentary on leaving the children out of the madness hun ,ABU
god i love you vox,NOT
so happy for you trish just make sure you arent undereating,NOT
to the lgbtq community do not get offended just point and laugh,NOT
cutting your dick off doesnt make you a girl,ABU
remember when she identified as a chicken nugget,NOT
of course i can sum this up in a sentence the wage gap isnt real,NOT
with the number of dislikes it shows that our education system needs looked into,NOT
lol anyone else notice the chickfila,NOT
i tried being vegan bc of freelee  i gave up after  weeks   i dont know how to just cut off meat completely especially when you live in a hispanic home and everything involves meat or dairy ,NOT
reason for the wage gap women read romance novels men read business books,NOT
no offense but also all the offense you cant be gay if youre non binary like all the men on queer eye say they are,NOT
she is garbage,NOT
pragu university where the chunky meatball marinara is made,NOT
i fix garbage trucks for  hours a week on average most people only work  hours now find how many will climb in the back of a garbage truck in ankle deep garbage juice broken glass and hydraulic oil to spend  hours replacing a cylinder while maggots are crawling around you compare that to answering a phone,NOT
feminism is bullshit women earn less than men because they just do,NOT
youre going vegan but youre still going to buy leather bags and products tested on animals lmao,NOT
worlds lost their g damn minds these announcements like michael r selling their souls for money its disgusting,ABU
just my opinion but it sounds like youre non binary not trans a trans man i would think is strictly masculine and you say you like to be girly some days and masculine the next i could be wrong not trying to anger anyone so correct me if im wrong but it doesnt sound like your trans but more non binary,NOT
the future is vegan so looking forward to see all the animal cruelty being finally illegal ,NOT
i am here to read the comments written by triggered people,NOT
theres animal products in your makeup too,NOT
oh god that banana girl is gonna be all crazy when she sees this,NOT
imagine the girl that trained her whole life and came in  place because theres  men racing with them thats not fair to them at all,ABU
back on drugs ,ABU
the parents are fucking retarded nobody is trying to exclude anyome from anything we just saying have them race boys since theyre both biological boys,ABU
these people are given an inch and take a mile or  miles,NOT
who else watched kevin garrahs video on this,NOT
that part where you said that who you are attracted to has nothing to do with what you identify aslolblaire now you know the lgbt is gonna say something on that  i know what you mean though but someone else wont lol because someones going to say well because im attracted to women identify as lesbian or because i am attracted to men i identify as gay lol so yeah that part might get some backlash keep up your videos love you always help me cheer up cause you are super funny,NOT
if i was a business manager andor owner i would set an hourly wage and pay everyone based on the hours they worked wait i think thats how it already works,NOT
just because you had short hair it doesnt make you a man,NOT
i dont give a damn how others identify themselves however this legitimately seems unfair isnt that obvious why are both of them dominating the female division major competitive advantage is the reason,NOT
she is a gay man in a womens body  hhhhmmmn yeah lol,NOT
 triggered feminists,NOT
at the end of the day this isnt a problem and the wage gap has nothing to do with discrimination but womens choices,NOT
pasta and rice hot chips wedges get some coconut milk soy milk with coffee oat milk with cereal blend some flavoured canned tomatoes with coconut milk basil and chives and theres a great sauce for pasta you can eat curries you can fry tofu in oil on its own or with bread crumbs noodles you can make salsa and nachos with beans and corn chips theres soo much you can eat peanut butter on toast is great for protein even though you dont need that much protein everyday roast veggies tones of stuff,NOT
you have got to be fucking kidding me trisha you have said a lot of dumb shit but this this is the icing on the cake youre literally downplaying the shit that people really go through,ABU
this is the future we need we need to learn from nature not exploit it into a fiery chaos vegan  lets go,NOT
lol these losers were i last place against the dudes so they turned into girls ,NOT
you guys are saying this is fake cause of her snap chat and stuff but she probably started the two weeks once she put the video out not when she filmed it,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap is that it doesnt exist,NOT
this was prerecorded didnt i see a video of you eating chicken a few nights ago im really confused lol ,NOT
greaaat news good luck with it i couldn t belive it when i saw the title happy for you,NOT
not as radical as i expected but the argument is limp dicked,NOT
they do have an unfair advantage in sports but i still support them as people,NOT
based mommy back at it again shooing away those mean feminists,NOT
what the fk dose this girl think she is hating on everyone ,NOT
so im not hating ive been watching t since i could remember but i really do not understand this i have multiple friends that are trans they want to be fully the gender they feel as they are they will go to any length to be a guy or girl whoever they are t has went through so many surgeries to get bigger breasts or an ass or a flatter stomach its all to give a girlish appearance ive never had a friend who had purposely made themselves look at opposite gender especially having money they had always tried to achieve to make themselves feel they when they do on the inside out,NOT
you need to eat before you get hungry if you start craving meat and dairy its because your brain wants calories eat rice pasta potatoes smoothies bowls for breakfast look on youtube for recipes quick vegan meals if you dont cook much,NOT
i find it hypocritical to say trisha isnt trans when were suppose to believe youre a woman just because you went full frankenstein youre both nutty,ABU
just like special olympics there should be a special category for these weirdos,ABU
my experience with private tutoring in math and science shows women make hour and men hr demand is much higher for female tutors,NOT
trisha is always on a different drug for each video,ABU
let them run against transgenders or men not the women they are built like men,ABU
 feminists are now angry and are still sticking fingers in their ears and closing their eyes while screaming on the floor like a  year old,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap it doesnt exist,NOT
girl we tiredt of this we really are even if this didnt intend to offend anyone newsflash it did the fact that youre so detached from reality that when filming editing and uploading this it never occured to you hmmm maybe i should rethink this one before spreading this misinformation regarding the lgbtq communitywheeww,NOT
where did yall go to find a firefighters hours be flexible thats either a amam shift or a pmpm shift  hour shift are not what most would call flexible,NOT
this is the problem with mass promotion of lgbt you get trenders and fakes and people so confused they accept the crazy as normal,ABU
obviously fruit and veg is vegan but find substitutes and things you can still eat so its easier oreos are vegan a lot of chips are vegan its not healthy but it definitely helps the transition,NOT
i wonder how jeffery and gigi feel about this,NOT
so this whole video shes saying shes ftm but everything she explains is the explanation of a person who nonbinary,NOT
i clicked this thinking you was that dr sham guy or whatever,NOT
this is ridiculous they wouldnt even compete with the boys,NOT
as a non binary person can i say that maybe some trans people arent doing it for clout and if you could refer to those non binary people as theythem in future videos that would be great ,NOT
glistening in the wind  ily,NOT
women usually go into lower paying jobs thats why there is a wage gap,NOT
as a trans man whos on hrt id just like to say there is no one in the comments or anyone who is allowed to tell anyone how much theyre allowed to conform whether they have to be on hrt or have to have surgery you dont need to have dysphoria to be trans you can literally use what pronouns make you most comfortable i think we should leave it at that,NOT
definitely eat potatoes baked fries baked potatoes sweet potatoes mashed potatoes best vegan food also bbq cauliflower bites look up hot for food recipe its so good if you just go the fruit route you will need to eat so many many calories because you will be starving eat at least  calories from fruit and veggies if youre doing fruit only,NOT
freelee shane uses vegan mock meat in his new rainbow taco video you are changing the world,NOT
having these guys compete against natural women is like expecting a regular human to compete against captain america or the black panther,ABU
i feel that they should compete against each other and other transgender boy their age clearly there is a unfair advantage however they still can play the sport with other transgender males,ABU
needless to say that more flexible hours are awesome for everyone not just ppl with children,NOT
man i wish liberals would watch this they wouldnt have a response because the gap doesnt exist,NOT
oh girl you need help so confused,NOT
never clicked a video so fast in my lifee,NOT
my favorite part of this video is that it was narrated by a woman,NOT
why do you talk like thaaat,NOT
 for all new vegans please check out vegan gains his video for trisha for some advice do not get trapped into thinking you have to follow freelees rawtill diet  eat super low fat etc that kind of restriction of perfectly healthy plant foods most likely wont keep you vegan long term,NOT
liked before watching,NOT
i fucking cant the comments have already covered everything im just going to sit back and watch this unfold,NOT
maybe women make less because they do not have the same pressure men have to get a well paying job is generally considered a bit embarrassing if a man makes less than his wife so the man is pressured to work more and try harder for better jobs,NOT
i find it incredibly hard to believe that a women and a man could go for the same job and some lazy dude would get paid more than an intelligent and hard working women just because he is a man like why would anyone waste their money doing that,NOT
i understand why people are mad but i honestly just think trish needs a bit of education yeah trish doesnt like labels but i think if somebody were to just sit down and educate trish on the subject a bit more i feel like trish would feel better herself and would be able to word it in a less offensive way,NOT
do know companies would higher only women if they where cheaper to higher because your get better profit margins did to salaries bering lower this is what third wave feminist dont understand that it choices you make not what gender you are that shows difference in pay between men and women because work on average from women is statically less then men  have babies therefore  months to year off job  men are more willing to do more overtime than women  it pretty simple if you dont do the time you wont get a dime very simple basic economics,NOT
this is super interesting it makes a lot more sense now because i was never well informed about this topic,NOT
just eat what you would normally eat but seek out the vegan alternative do not try and transition into a healthier lifestyle you will view veganism as a diet it is not a diet its a lifestyle you can try the healthier version after your adjust so eat to your hearts content and try and search out cool restaurants etc and inspire your tastebuds good luck this is going to be so awesome for you ,NOT
i saw this how amazing theres hope lol so proud of her ,NOT
omg your cat is so cute,NOT
ur talking to fast lol,NOT
such a great video i read the paper by goldin and this summary of the key findings was so good,NOT
i love you guys you are doing super super coooool purrrrrrr,NOT
honestly  weeks on a vegan diet isnt going to do much in terms of weight also youll want to lay off the oily foods,NOT
you should do it for like a month or so though it will be easier after about  days or so,NOT
they are still trying to push this false narrative its been disproven and explained thousands of times by now how many more times are needed they are seriously starting to sounds like creationists or climate change deniers at this point refusing to accept any sort of evidence and studies,NOT
your being sexist for disagreeing to the beached whales i mean feminist same thing,ABU
oh shes lost it completely lost it,NOT
just like factory meat veganism isnt sustainable from an agricultural point if view either,NOT
i dont understand vegans who eat fake meat  its not healthy  if you stand for not eating meat why are you eating something thats supposed to represent meat,NOT
haha im deceased ily blaire,NOT
you dont need to like me just need to view me  you are awesome ,NOT
freakonomics did a better job of exploring this topic and coming to the same conclusion women are more likely to work less and stop working to nurture either kids and or help elderly women are more nurturing and that makes us super stars in my book im so glad women are on the planet,NOT
lmbo why does boy style trisha remind me of tisha cambell,NOT
trisha you should totally do a before and after after your two weeks of vegan diet,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap it doesnt exist,NOT
well at least this was far better than the proposals from general feminists,NOT
i find this video really offensive,NOT
i know who to place my bets on  a cheetah that identify itself as a horse,NOT
a logical and rational presentation that covers more comprehensive than the simple flawed  theory instant dislikes from feminists,NOT
i guess the gap can be explained by pregnancy and by all those jobs where strength is useful so the guys have a big advantage,NOT
trisha im a vegan and in the morning you can have a smoothie and lunch fruit and dinner you could eat vegetables and a lot of greens love you ,NOT
finally this day has come trisha you are my inspiration in life and i am so happy that you are trying the vegan lifestyle you are going to love it your body is so bombastic already but you are going to look like an angel at first it is hard but you will get through it for me it was giving up ice cream but ben  jerrys dairy free peanut butter and cookies ice cream hits the spot and all of gardein chicken tenders are sooooooooo good too eat all you can and always know the fishies are always here for you and i love you lots i wish you amazing luck ps never starve yourself eat lots of grapes instead,NOT
neither of them have won anything  i just destroyed the womans bench press record for my weight identifying as a woman  so it equates to legal steroid usage  soooo gay  satan certainly workin in this bitch ,ABU
go off queen ,NOT
eat a truck load of potatoes rice pasta and other filling foods with lots of carbs fruit and vegetables are great but if you eat just that then youl be hungry and wanna quit were proud of you and i wish you the best remember potatoes rice pasta all the time,NOT
just became raw vegan sept of   life changing ,NOT
this is a joke i have no hate towards these men what are we doing here people this is why im no longer a liberal maybe i will be again but the liberal democrats have done all of this playing race against people playing sex against people,ABU
freelee you are making a difference you made a difference in my lifei owe you  months from vegetarian to vegan bless ,NOT
no real economist supports the wage gap,NOT
well done love it bring on  ,NOT
you know when you suddenly change team and keep hitting st and nd place you should know something is not right,NOT

i couldnt think of sam smiths name when i heard a song the other day so i looked at my boyfriend and said isnt that their song and he just looked at me crazy its sam smith who else are you thinking of i told him i was just talking about smith and he asked who is they though i explained the pronouns and he just walked away from me,NOT
i dont even know where to start with thid,NOT
k fat sexually frustrated feminists who didnt get their morning donuts watched this video,NOT
old video she already filmed the music video lol she isnt vegan anymore she ate bacon and eggs yesterday,NOT
i am not vegan or vegetarian at the moment but i have been watching your vlogs for a while and i have a few ideas that i think could help i have noticed that you dont cook for yourself all that oftenwhich honestly i dont either lol however being vegan i hear that you have to learn how to cook or you will get really bored of the food you eat i think it would be smart to look at a lot of the vegan restaurants or healthy restaurants around your area and find out what you like if you do this you have somewhere to eat when you go out and you can always post mate it when you dont feel like cooking again i am not speaking from experience but i feel as though finding these restaurants will open your eyes to new vegan foods you might like and you would have no excuse to not eat vegan good luck trisha,NOT
vegan since one month and will never go back  becoming an activist now ,NOT
glad you are going vegan for  weeks trisha its a start sweets shame though you are in bed with freelee the banana girl though guess youtube needs you to help that absolute copyright stealing bitch out viewers who dont know she had a guys channel removed with false copyright claims huge in vegan community check out get upset channel  these are the girls she stole from literally joe vegan  vegsn lass all these channels have done reporting on it again trisha good in you for doing it for  weeks,NOT

shes so cute ,NOT
good for you girl ,NOT
greatest b day present ever,NOT
guys i have an idea what if the wage gap is actually caused by a combination of the phenomenon described in this video the fact that women might be less ambitious on average and a bit of old school sexism,NOT
watch the vegan activist cheap lazy vegan mr and mrs vegan and that vegan couple,NOT
okay trisha you identify as a female you literally said you identify as your naturalborn gender which is female shut the fuck up with your transphobic bullshit oh no you had to wear sports bras  bitch shut up that doesnt make you trans at all youre a tomboy you literally have no dysphoria you have your fucking tits out the entire fucking time you have more male characteristics oh you dont wanna be the center of attention  that doesnt fucking make you trans girls dont have to wear makeup or do their hair to be a girl im a trans guy and i fucking hate this video so much just because youre into gay guys doesnt make you a guy let me say this again you are not a man so many people have opposite sex envy and they arent trans im sure a lot of girls especially ones going through puberty envy men because itll make their life easier thats not what dysphoria is dysphoria is not opposite sex envy dysphoria is wanting the opposite sex because itll match their gender gender dysphoria is a legitimate mental thing genderfluid doesnt exist some gay men date ftm people and dont have a problem with having sex with them despite their female parts because they dont have gynophobia some gay men do have gynophobia but thats not my point my point is that you are not transgender you are a cisgender female coming from a real trans guy you experience little to no gender dysphoria i apologize for being so rude im normally not and i normally try to have a rational and respectful conversation but im so pissed at this a lot of people dont like their given name not all of them are trans you really need to get the idea that youre even remotely considering being trans you were happy with short hair because you dont like the responsibility of having long hair most real trans guys want short hair because thats typically masculine masculinity does not equal male femininity does not equal female you can be a feminine boy or a masculine girl your attraction does not have anything to do with your genderidentity unless your attraction to men being ftm but not knowing makes you feel gay or vice versa that would be the only instance that attraction affects identity when youre trans ftm you dont have a male side because you are male you are not male you are not a gay man seriously dont identify as trans or come out unless youve seen a licensed gender therapist and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria yes you actually have to be diagnosed in most places you need an official diagnosis to go on hormones or just medically transition in any way but of course you cant medically transition because youll just develop dysphoria because youre transitioning to something that you think you wantare but really you dontarent please spare yourself the time energy hate and dysphoria and shut up get the idea out of your head that youre even remotely trans please,ABU
boys scholarships will never be in jeopardy but girls will lose scholarships left and right,NOT

men are so good we won the girls track champioship,ABU
    werent you just talking about how it doesnt matter if someone is more masculine or feminine they can still be the same gender   sam smith is nonbinary dont try to disregard that and say hes just a dude which is extremely offensive   so hes not allowed to be nonbinary because he isnt talking about it   before nonbinary was even a thing so gay people werent around before the s so transgenders werent around before the s wtf are you talking about,NOT
im not  sure so please correct me if im wrong would she not be considered gender fluid maybe i dont mean to sound disrespectful im just ignorant of some of the various sexualities but gender fluid is denoting or relating to a person who does not identify themselves as having a fixed gender so this is more so what shes trying to get across,NOT
so delicious snickerdoodle ice cream,NOT
they are girls so let them compete with the girls,NOT
im vegetarian and veggie balls looks like meat balls but are not made of meat are one of my fave foods you can get them at super store i tend to bake them then put them in a frying pan with some vegetable oil to make them less dry then just add noodles or rice and veggies to sorta make a stir fry its really good and i only need to make a little bit cause its so filling anyways thats my tip also veggie dogs or veggie burgers are good too you can get them at super store as well,NOT
every time i see her her lips are bigger poor lil things,NOT
your face is really cute holy fuck,NOT
the biggest thing that no one has mentioned is the fair pay act of  it is illegal to pay some one less for the same job my question is why there are not lawsuits for breaking the law oh because only like  have been filed so far and more than half of those were found not true,NOT

im glad to see this but at the same time youre not going vegan youre going plant based going vegan implies that seeing and knowing what goes on in factory farms and fur farms has effected your morals entirely and that you have decided to stop supporting the evil veganism is not a diet its a change of perspective  its not supporting animal torture for the sake of taste and luxury i hope your plant based diet does make you go vegan though we need more people with a conscience ,NOT

the graph even says earnings not wage,NOT
 thats actually mathematically incorrect if a man earns  and a woman earns  that means that the man earns  more that the woman and that a woman earns  less than the man,NOT
hum i agree that these numbers are controversial however it shows that the place and the occupation of men and women are still different in our societies if you want to achieve global equality and liberty any job should not be labelled as a man or a women job why women should be less interested in engineering and why men should be less interested in social organization  why do women do more parttime job  why are they more women than men staying home taking care of the children ,NOT
it is not just about choice since the beginning women have been held at lower standards than men and it has been going on even now in ,NOT
i recommend getting more veggies my mum puts hemp hearts into my food for extra protein and i cant even taste it cauliflower can be made to taste like lots of yummy things so i recommend cauliflower hot wings recipes are not hard to find at all for them and theyre easy,NOT

veganism is an evil death cult,ABU

bianca stanescu daughter just a weak bitch that cant be as fast as those girls smh all those people making petitions sensitive,ABU
yay go vegan everybody its the best thing you can do for the planet animals and yourself ,NOT
the wage gap is a lie stop lying  its been illegal to pay women less since the s in america see equal pay act of   comparing someone that works housekeeping or in a call center to a banker or ceo is intellectually dishonest  any earnings gap is due to hours worked someone who works only  hours a week will always take home less than someone who works  hours a week amount of years with employers who give annual raises also effect earnings in companies that dont automatically give yearly raises and where a person has to ask for a raise if you dont ask you only have yourself to blame for not getting a raise  businesses are in it to make money if the wage gap was real the bottom line would argue that only hiring women would be in the businesses best interest,NOT
another reason is because its illegal to pay women less or more,NOT
stupid women who cant even do simple math bark about wage gap that is nonexistent ,NOT
yes gardien is  vegan and delicious and tastes just like the real thing,NOT
vegans stop the pussiness and engage the vaccine war vaccines are not vegan,ABU
she is a hater and then dont they take hormone therapy so it going to replace testosterone rt,NOT
there most definitely is a wage gap between men and women about two thirds of the gap is due to uneven distribution among various occupations and differences in skills and experience while the last third cannot be explained and has been attributed to discrimination in the work force the discrimination can be explained by the glass ceiling which is the seemingly invisible barrier hindering advancement of women and minorities in a maledominated organization clayton  works cited clayton gary e economics principles  practices new york ny glencoemcgrawhill ,NOT
if she identifies as her natural born gender then shes not transgender right ,NOT
all i can focus on is how scary her mouth is no offense t,NOT
here u go feminist why theres a so called pay gap or gender gap or what ever you call it now a day,NOT

freelee has inspired me so much  i love you girl dont let any hate get in your way ,NOT
american diabetes association  guy interviewed them talking about cure an prevention the ada rep starts an argument an runs out the room  moral of the story dont trust charitys they keep you sick they keep getting paid,NOT
oversimplified pharmacist is a bad example because they tend to all do the exact same thing so its easy to justify earning what your peers earn meanwhile a scientist or business persons position could take on a whole range of possible responsibilities and niches some with more earning potential than others so if the pharmacists wage gap is  then theres your argument proving there is a wage gap,NOT
eh whatever this is just the flip flop cycle of humans  generations later go back to meat predicting right here,NOT
poor families are two income families while rich families are one income families where usually the man works  hours per week while the woman stays at home managing the household and thats mostly because those women want that if the relationship is new and the guy loses his job and cant find a good one and doesnt get a good income anymore theres a big chance she will find another boyfriend  thats how men are stimulated to put a lot of care into their career the same way that women are stimulated to put a lot of care into their looks what this means is that women from rich environments often choose not to work while poor women often dont have that choice and a result a larger percentage of working women come from poor environments that is the primary reason why men get payed more it has absolutely nothing to do with men having more chances the only places they might have more chances is in top business functions sports or acting or careers like that where salary is entirely arbitrary but this is only relevant to at most  of the population,NOT
this makes alot more sense than the blatant accusation that men get paid more just because theyre men,NOT
i think maybe she just if a little confused and has pressure on her and maybe she should introduce her self as gender fluid,NOT
if you put grapes in the freezer please be careful because they can be hard to chew and sometimes theyll slip and can choke you,NOT

she just posted a video called im questioning girllll,NOT
they naturally have testosterone  of course they do everyone does how dumb are you,NOT
but my college professor with a phd says shes right about the wage gap,NOT
if you are reading this you have come too far and shouldnt go any further,NOT

i feel bad for both sides honestly,NOT
omg my daughter and i love you so much love you youtube channel,NOT
i see two solutions to this problem wage increases for lowerincome jobs encourage women to take up ceo and political positions and ask for raises more its wellknown that women are not as interested on average in ceo and political positions as men that is why its fair that women make up  of politicians because about  of the people running for office are women if this has to do with their upbringing then this can be fixed but if this is just because women on average dont want those jobs then the only solution is to raise the wages on lowerincome jobs also i find it ironic that women in the us are the majority of people going to and graduating from college yet theyre still under represented in higher income positions,NOT
didnt you have chicken strips in your snapchat though lmfao not bashing but just asking ,NOT
omg you need to tr gardein chicken its fuking life changing,NOT
im really happy how freelee is handling this shes being very kind mature supportive and very helpful so proud of both of them,NOT
just because you dont conform to female stereotypes doesnt mean youre trans,NOT
just create a transgender race or man up to your true or natural competition,NOT
female to male is trans identifying as a male one day a female another day both genders one day or no gender another day is genderfluid not all girls are into doing their hair and make up and stuff i think she is just confused tbh ,NOT
so the simple answer is that men on average are willing to work harder,NOT
there is still a problem women still staying at home taking care of the kids because the majority of men refuse to that makes quite a portion of women in marriage leave their jobs and not make any money it affects statistics it doesnt mean that women are paid less just like you said but it is still sexism another problem may be the way we are socialized a study shows that women in general have way less selfesteem than men this influences career chooses while men tend to go for a harder degree women with the same grades go for a easier one that happens because men usually overrate their capabilities while women do the opposite that kind of justifies the fact that there are so many men studying engeneering and so many women at magistrate degrees another fact is that wherever there is a space with a high proportion of male presence that space is masculinified and it pushes away many women from taking a step an being part of it at last but not least there are some studies which show that women tend to choose careers in relation to caring of others like pedagogy related degrees or healthcare and those of course are not tastes we are born with there are a whole lot of psychology studies that show us the evidence about that i say that as a psychologist well i think i left a lot of room for yall to think some of these thoughts of mine are only hypothesis but im pretty sure that they will turn out to be true if somebody makes a research,NOT
this is amazing trish please dont listen to hate from militant vegans i know it can be off putting the only way i became vegan was baby steps i couldnt do it overnight but the main thing is that you know every step you take will only ever do more good for health planet  animals  x cheaplazyvegan was the best youtuber for recipes when i was transitioning good luck x,NOT
just do like every army does and make standard pay grades legally required,NOT
in the gap graph around  we see women born in  having a wage gap that decreases from the ages of  how is this happening why isnt the initial childbearing gap ages  persisting throughout their careers shouldnt that gap be very hard to close for example if i save less when im younger its hard to catch up  to close a savings gap  with someone who saves more when shes younger are older women getting better raises and wages relative to older men indeed much better raises and wages to close that early gap or is it simply that the initial gap in actual dollars matters less and less as a percentage as the numberssalaries get bigger,NOT
the only thing good about transgenders is not having to buy plan b,ABU
peta has a lot of menus that you can order when u go out to eat like if you go out to eat look up vegan options at that restaurant by the way im vegan and ur aweeesome b,NOT
you forget about the amount of risk taking that men tent do take which yields results in business and either gets you and your company richer or fired every woman i know in the field of business or politics tends to play it safe that is effective but also affects the wage gap in business a whole lot i also wonder about the statistics of demanding a raise look like,NOT
these are some valid points the only thing i would add is as follows note i dont think that the pay gap exists but im open to different opinions if they have evidence of their thoughts  women since they give birth to the child they will most of the time be more caring towards a child  women also can get paid maternity leave in which they still get paid their same amount but taking care of a child  if a man and a woman are working in sales with commissions it depends on how they are selling if the man sells more he gets more money if the man sells less he gets less money and vice versa with women,NOT
did the people in the comments not watch the video,NOT
ya trisha is definitely a girly girl and not a man in any way she just likes gay guys and thinks their hot also she thinks if she is too lazy to put on makeup and hair shes a dude lols,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist at all so,NOT
ok but wtf,NOT
at first i thought wow trisha passes quite well i cant believe blaire would try to say shes still a guy and then i realized that i was dead wrong yet again,NOT
im honestly so excited about this really hoping she stays vegan for good,NOT

i would become vegan but chicken is too good ,NOT
what video shell do next pregnancy announcement going trans,NOT
people realize that the wage gap isnt representative of two people with the same exact job the problem with the wage gap is that women are stuck into traditionally lower paying jobs based on systematic oppression and irrational gender stereotypes its not communism its a culture still recovering from political social and economic gender inequality,NOT
smiling the whole way through this weve come so far ,NOT
this video was recorder a while ago bitch has eaten meat  dairy since then smh please girl stop,ABU

ive wondered for a while if trisha has undiagnosed did it would explain so much of her behavior,NOT
parents should of got the child help its a mental health problem if youre a biological male and you think your a woman its delusional,ABU
curious as to why this is such a huge issue youd have to look very to find any two groups who earn the same amount asian men make more than white men white women earn more than black women what is being about these differences what about the gaps between us citizens and german citizens why is one earning less it seems like one group is wanting special treatment,NOT
im still not convinced id like to see a study showing how often and how strongly women negotiate higher pay compared to men,NOT
theyre men plain and simple their bodies have developed with a natural advantage ie muscle mass muscle twitch response natural power and strength deep voice i find the whole thing very strange they should have a transgender olympics that would sort the problem paralympics were introduced for people with disadvantages who wouldnt be able to compete on a level playing field with able bodied people yet obviously advantaged transgenders especially male to female are expected to be allowed to compete with smaller less powerful women what the fucks this world coming to when people just cant be happy with who they are from the start,ABU
ive never kept up with her but im actually hella pissed off at this video trish youre a dick im sorry its true this video is part of the reason why this community isnt taken seriously im so fucking pissed off because my sister is male to female and i just feel like this is bullshit asking for attention this is bullshit im sorry this is absolute bullshit,ABU
trish there is nothing manly about you your mannerisms your style  the way you speak and think all feminine this is all so staged she says i dont like to be the center of attention  really trisha really,NOT
i believe this is inaccurate i make just as much as my male and pale counterparts just find a good place,NOT
females are all for this shit untill they realize men are gonna take over everything they worked so hard for in the passed century,NOT
so you are basically saying that there is a wage gap because men and women are doing different work deep,NOT
the proof is in the pudding two boys pretending to be girls are winning    place in all the races do we really need any more common sense to point out that theyre winning because theyre boys competing against girls do we really,ABU
some of the comments are harsh this is a big step for trish let her take her time give her encouragement dont discourage her dont hate her for eating pizza comment a good dupe tofutti pizza is ,NOT

what they really mean is women should be paid the same as a man for the same job title not the same work i have noticed in my life i have had the same job title as women but i was required to lift more any produce more then then women in my job just cause you think you are working harder then someone else doesnt mean you are if someone takes  min to do a job and i take  min todo the same job i will spend  min pissing around so does that mean the person that took twice as long to do the job working twice as hard nope this idea that woman work as hard as men or harder is bs sorry that woman have to put in more energy to do the same work as men but you are not working harder,NOT
the people who disliked are radical feminists,NOT
trishai love your videosbut slow down for the love of pete sometimes i cant understand what youre saying lolbut what helps a ton is watching what i eat in a day for vegans theres so much more than fruit to eat in your diet best of luck and record it please we would love to watch,NOT

bullshit you put in the time you make more money if you choose to have kid and put your priorities towards that instead of work you make less simple cant do both also men have occupied most of the dirty dangerous hard jobs not stuck in a safe air conditioned cubical  i cant stand feminists a byproduct of weakness,ABU
what people miss about the wage gap is that it doesnt exist,NOT
this is taking this to far and effecting natural girls if my real daughter was in this state running we would boycott,ABU
check out hot for food,NOT
i watched the whole thing before i consider disliking and this seems interesting its not a blatant feminist video saying that discrimination exists against women in the work place but the video shows actual research and studies as to how the pay gap widens in strict inflexible jobs because of how women bear children,NOT
ive watch trisha for  years now i truly dont think she is transgender but i think that she believes so right now if that makes sense i think shes just confused about a lot of things sadly i think there are a lot of mental battles she is fighting,NOT
trisha i love you youve become such a positive role model not just talking about this video,NOT
im a slow black boy so i decided to be a fast black girl,ABU
so youre telling me that women receiva less money because they dont make the correct choices really ,NOT
i cant wait to see how this plays out,NOT

this should be called why peopele dont go vegan,NOT
the look of freelees genuine happiness warmed my heart,NOT
yay awesomeyes vlog the weeks it is such a great choice to go vegan,NOT
as the video demonstrated the wage gap does exist and is driven by the society valuing male dominated professions more as a business owner i do find that women often times agree to the lower salary compared to men,NOT
yes i saw that video and i was so excited to see that she was switching over wow shes going to feel so much better and shes going to influence so many people like you said she had so many viewers she can influence so many kids to a healthier life one thats compassionate to all life and to themselves bless your heart,NOT
the world would be a better place for all living beings if we all went vegan which means no harm to our planet health and animals plus less casualties in this world  cant wait to see this vegan movement grow bigger,NOT

trisha your description sounds like a nonbinary person to me,NOT
great trish dont be afraid of eating too much as long as u eat enough  dont limit yourself u will love it  feel your best good luck ,NOT
and gay men dont get fucking sex changes so here is a lesson trish gay men date gay men they keep their parts and stay as male lesbians are women who date women drag queens are men who dress up in womens clothing transvestites are men who like wearing womens clothing with no goal to become a woman transgender male to female and female to male we are individuals who have body dysphoria our bodies dont match our brain state we hate having the parts we were born with and fight to become the the gender which will align with ur mind heart and soul we are the ones who get sex changes bisexuals are men or women who will date both sexes hope this helped we dont do it for attention we dont do it to get onto tv or put in magazines and we certainly dont use it to get views,NOT
finally some common sense,NOT
vegan years best decision felt like my soul got cleansed,NOT
did no one listen to her she said shes only going vegan for  weeks not a total lifestyle change just a diet change,NOT
generally men demand more money ask for raises more often while for some reason women dont ask for raises as often  this is a stat that could be being missed ,NOT

i think you meant to say youre gender fluid cuz ur not trans ,NOT
they have an unfair advantage they are females and i respect that but they are biologically males and so they have more muscles and can physically run faster on average however i feel that trans males should be able to compete with biological males because the have physical disadvantages over biological males but not in gymnastics because females are on average more flexible than the average male,NOT
what a surprise a woman complaining about something,ABU
well the obvious solution is to have men get pregnant as well i mean we have to assume that more mothers are going to want to take time off to raise the child they made vs the fathers we have to make people women make people it takes a lot of dedicated time women are going to have less time to workexperience than men in the same age group the only way to make up for that disparity is to artificially inflate wages for women lets be honest thats what were talking about right,NOT
how is the argument of the wage gap even still a thing i mean wasnt this proven to be a myth years ago,NOT
this video shouldve gone into more detail the analysis was pretty shallow,NOT
yayyyy i am so happy for you,NOT
thank you prageru,NOT
watch ben shapiro use this all the time,NOT
congrats on your transition from female to female,NOT
damn i just found this prageru youtube channel they are incredible at addressing very controversial and prevalent topics with clear and authoritative evidence i am so proud of prageru good for them for taking on these important issues from a evidence based viewpoint,NOT

there are also so many vegan starbucks options too  i usually get a vanilla frappuccino coffee with soy milk no whip cream and it is amazing,NOT
i dont know why but im always surprised when i see a woman going against feminists and their made up crap,NOT
fam you sound gender fluid,NOT
dont sound like genderbodysocail dysphoria its not fun to be trans at all the sugery s and the pain that comes with it and hormons for the rest of your life the axeity and the depression that comes is the reality of trans people that do all this to be themself and to make life worth living for them please dont just tell yourself your trans because you dont like masculine men this is not dysphoria,NOT
get ready for itthe next argument about the wage gap that feminists are now using is males simply wont allow them to enter the higher paying professions men are sexist and competitive and therefore scare woman away from the career by hurting their feelings so now instead of choosing petroleum engineer women now have to go into a lower paid position like social work their arguments never die  they just come up with new stupid ones after their old ones are debunked and die out ive actually had feminist friends say that girls are purposely intimidated out of math and science careers so that men can solely hold those positions,NOT
way to go trish good luck ,NOT
vegan since never  best decision ever,NOT
im confused she says that she was born a female but she identifies as a boy but she looks completely like a girl,NOT
do you have any idea how work in a laboratory or in business works it seems like youve oversimplified it way too much to fit your hypothesis,NOT
love you girl hope you can figure out what you feel in yourself soon,NOT
i dont know why but i hate fruit so much i can literally not eat it it just doesnt taste good for me i have really bad and unhealthy eating habits for example a warm meal without meat isnt a good meal for me thats why i could never be vegan since i consume so much meat its unbelievable but im not hating on vegans theyre cool,NOT
wow l have never seen a conservative ad before l was going to come over here to dislike it because l thought she would talk about how the wage gap is real instead l gave it a like,NOT
go and follow mommy tang watch her food recipes d,NOT
interesting video but it neglected to mention that men typically work longer hours and are as a group more economically productive over the course of their lives this means they contribute more to maintaining social systems than they get out of them because they pay more taxes so things basically even out in the end,NOT
honestly i am so confused like what arent you basically gender fluid,NOT
its not true that you can eat as many calories as you want and not gain weight try checking out some of high carb hannahs videos,NOT

nice download extension btw fuck u tube copyright terms am i right,NOT
while i seem to agree that this video is right about its point it didnt really disprove the wage gap instead it puts the gap into perspective also you assumed that the people pushing the wage gap are liars ignorance and a whole slew of other factors can make a person stick with the wrong opinion,NOT
ummm yeah the majority of crushes i have st sebastian frodo antinous  aka the holy trinity of hotness are at least somewhat associated with being gay  especially antinous so according to trishas logic i guess i should start identifying as a  drag queen now in all seriousness god bless everyone online and irl who are willing to put up with all my classical curlyhaired manloving crazy  anyways off from that tangent keep up the awesome work blaire white youre gorgeous funny intelligent and very entertaining to watch,NOT

thank you for trying to find all the facts,NOT
for the most part up until this point i didnt even respect vox as a credible media outlet i saw this video and decided to watch it because i think its important to listen to differing opinions even if you disagree with them let me just say this video is extremely well done i personally believe in all of my research into the subject that i believe that there is a wage gap but all but about  can be attributed to lifestyle choices vox you guys knocked this one out of the park and i sincerely appreciate the neutrality shown in displaying the facts the wage gap exists but it is not  cents on the dollar b,NOT
i always joke my sister is a drag queen born on the wrong body because she has a lot of friends that are homossexual she loves to dress and make up extravagantly etc but thats just it a joke because she was born a woman and dates men thats it really its not so complex people today is just triyng to adapt reality for their flimsy fantasies than adapt themselves to reality,NOT

more vegan videos ,NOT
there are only two questions relevant here  do women get paid less for doing the same job title with the same job requirements as men no the dont because that is illegal  do women have the same opportunity to move into higher paying jobs and demand the same pay as men via negotiations yes they do once these are considered any difference is purely down to the choices made by men and women and if women want to have kids they must accept that they are going to suffer in terms of pay but if they want kids clearly kids are more important than a career so who are you to judge,NOT
im confused doesnt this help prove that there is a gender wage gap precisely because men are in the high paying fields such as engineering and computer science while women are in more low paying fields such as education and social work yes it is each individuals choice to be in those fields but only because our society encourages them to go into those fields and still sets women up as the carers and teachers while setting men up as the brainiacs and scientists or athletes most of us dont do this on purpose but we all do it indirectly by supporting gender traditions like barbie vs hot wheels or the wife taking the last name of the husband and we have gender traditions for the worforce too for example picture an airline pilot and a flight attendant i always picture the pilot to be male and the flight attendant to be female same for me goes with chefserver doctornurse managerreceptionist i always thought this is what was meant by the gender wage gap which this video proved to be true not that companies are so sexist they literally pay men more than women to say that so many women choose these caretaker jobs over men and that so many men choose these intellectual jobs over women is all based on each individuals choice seems to be ignoring our gender defining culture right now we are still a fairly sexist society wouldnt that affect everything especially the workforce,NOT

smart as a marble please blaire,NOT
from most studies ive read through the data seems to always point towards childbirth most women have to take quite a few weeks off because of this phenomena so when they return their income tends to lessen compared to if they didnt therefore one of the easier ways to end the wage gap is to give paid family leave to the mothers and fathers so the wages dont decrease upon the parents return to work this will also add a much healthier relationship between fathers and their children and take the edge off of the average working class wife who has to return to their job after giving birth to realize her salary has just dropped compared to their coworkers,NOT
but the portuguese government just wasted almost  million euros to end gender inequality in companies hey socialism,NOT

this is ridiculousthe man was like the girls should run fasterhe wants people to be sensitive to his feelings of becoming a woman and isnt sensitive to the fact that he clearly without a shadow of a doubt has a unfair advantage in the sport against womenno professional association is going to allow them to compete against woman so no college should give them a scholarship when they technically are on steroids to winfutures are being taken away from rightful athletes that are hoping to gain an opportunity to go for scholarshipslike i said ridiculous,ABU

you cant just live off fruit you need to eat starches ,NOT
if she feels the way she does she has a right too how is it okay for a man to want to be a women and not get judged but if a women wants to explain the reasoning for her sexuality shes dragged if to ppl she doesnt sound educated thats fine but shell learn its  and ppl need to let her express her self because she didnt have to make this video but she did it to set her self free and to let her supporters know,NOT
its simple the wage gap doesnt exist why because if it did then companies left and right would be hiring females exclusively to save  of money from paying their workers income meaning that rather paying a good number of their male workers  theyd have to pay their allfemale workers  saving that extra  it doesnt take extensive research nor rocket science to debunk the wage gap myth however the point about women being also busy at home and how it relates to their wage is also a good example of why women also earn less in jobs than men great video,NOT
at  strongest animals on the planet you conveniently forgot lions tigers and grizzly bears,NOT
the pay gap is even lower and almost non existent in countries with better maternity leave pay than the us that helps bring the average pay of those women up while theyre having kids,NOT

ive been an accountant for a long time and seen a lot of payrolls the wage gap is complete hooey ive seen lots of cases where women make more than men in the exact same job,NOT
trishas doing anything to try and stay relevant,NOT
 median then at  its average who has the maths problem now,NOT
anecdote women often choose aspects of a job that dont have anything to do with pay for example my boss is a single mother who is now a department head at my small company she used to hold another lower paying position she is still being paid at the scale of that lower position even though shes been dept head for  years she knows that if she left she could make considerably more elsewhere why does she stay because she is allowed to pretty much make her own schedule from day to day and to telecommute when she feels like it without even asking permission i dont think there has been a single day where she was here when i arrived and only took a one hour lunch and was here when i left her child has a million extracurricular activities and she can attend to all of them this may be an extreme example but women make these sorts of tradeoffs more often than men and its because they want to,NOT
okay i sort of understand what shes trying to say but honey if you had genuine gender dysphoria you would have been out a long time ago thats all there is to it maybe you are gender queer or non binary if anything but youre def not a ftm who adheres to the binary because transsexual trans people whether mtf or ftm all have gender dysphoria,NOT
girl shut the fuck up,NOT
trisha the whole transgender community has always like called me for some reason the trans community yall hear sumn,NOT
are you fucking stupid like deadass the next video gonna be im getting my penis removed like your not transgender dumbass,ABU
a very nice and well put together video with a lot of great data there is just one problem all of it is about earnings not necesserily wage as a matter of fact it is illegal to discriminate on gender for the exact same job equal pay act  wether a difference in earnings is something that has to be corrected is therefore debatable i bet you could make a very similar chart for iq and get a difference in earnings not saying women are dumber then men that wouldnt be based on an outward characteristic the problem i encounter here is the idea that the desired goal is to have an equal pay across the bord regardless of extra hours worked negotiations in wage or sick days etc there are a lot of variables that strifing for equality of outcome as equalizing earnings would be becomes a case of holding back people that want and can do more in a sense it is opressing them by not allowing them to choose to excell wether man or woman doesnt really matter to me quotas and wage redistribution are not solutions,NOT
go to mummy tang channel for awesome and nutritious vegan food ideas and recipes you need more than fruits and veg to maintain good health like rice and beans,NOT
women take twice as many sick days as men  undoubtedly due to children  but the fact is what it is men also work far more hours and are  x more likely to die on the job we also pay for the majority of everything  whats that a dinner date im sure youll be reaching for your purse in short we deserve it,NOT
k feminist disliked this video,NOT
one of the most insightful things ive seen about the wage gap great video,NOT
thanks for channel avoidance headsup the world is already confused enough,NOT
i mean ok  is better than it used to be but its still quite a difference idk,NOT
try a vegan cookbook it will save your life also oatmeal mixed with organic orange juice,NOT
im part of extinction rebellion mallorca best move i ever done if you doubt it just join because its a incredible move and to the people that are negative just start eating lemon grass and bee positive because this is the move and theres no going back quit eating flesh think about animals eating you would you like it i dont think so well its the same with the animals and humans eating them viva extinction rebellion,NOT
i dont think unfair because its girl much faster then guys,NOT
raw food is not the secret,NOT
lets unpack this so im transgender diagnosed dysphoria transgender the fact that she is called herself trans when she obviously is not is sickening it hurts the trans community being trans is a mental disorder not a game of fucking dress up wow you were more tomboy as a kid that doesnt male you trans the fact that she has to compensate of how shes still feminine by saying that since shes a gay man that we like more frilly things i beleive that when it is a cis male but when you are a transgender male you will want to pass as such you wont want to look girly because being misgendered hurts trisha needs to get it throigh her thick skull that this is not okay being trans isnt dress up being trans is where your brain and body dont match up hers matches up just fine this has me fuming you arent trans if you dont have dysphoria trisha you arent passing as male that is a key thing to a transgender male you are a grown ass women who needs to stop playing dress up and hurting a community you arent apart of,NOT
fake women get treated the same,NOT
the wage gap is so old and obviously debunked im an extreme leftist and i know this,NOT
its so obvious shes doing this for controversy and popularity shes done this time and time again on her channel voted for trump came out as lesbian became emo yall really dont need to spend the energy to get triggered by such obvious trolling,NOT
okay so this video seems so far to make it sound like being a feminist is a bad thing i am a feminist in the way that i think people should be equal no matter what there gender and that yes there maybe some wrong info but doesnt mean there isnt a difference between the way men and women are treated i may be a bit confused so if you would like to explain to me how i am wrong or whatever in the comments nicely feel welcome to do so,NOT
it sounds more like youre just eating vegan technically vegans dont eatuse anything that is made from animals or tested on animals including things like leather bags and shoes im not a vegan so i dont have a vested interest just thought some might like the distinction,NOT
feminists are gonna go mad,NOT
of course it is unfair that is the reason why men and women have always competed separately if transgender want to compete compete against each other not other women or men they have too much testosterone to compete against women,NOT
honestly they werent even that ahead from the other girls,NOT
thank you plant based news  you guys are the best  more earthling ed connections please  he is like you guys  very informed and very calm and centred,NOT
reads the title me that it doesnt exist any who pls be more realistic vox men stay in work longer studies over short  long periods of time show men are more likely to ask for raises and ask for more hours its statistically proven that woman take more leaves then men on a  scale this also doesnt account for that nearly the entire part time work force strictly consists of woman why should an employers pay a part timer as much as a full timer woman in theyre twenties and forties are out partying and going through jobs until they finally settle down with someone when they start to have a kid its only till near retirement age when this so called gender age gap is nonexistent because men and woman are working full time at the same rate you idiots forget to look at presented facts because you know the gender pay gap is baloney no serious economist not even female economist take this gender pay gap serious the new third reich yes i said that of feminism is unneeded its just an escape hole for feminist to bash men if we paid woman less then why wouldnt we just hire all woman exactly woman in the science field are more likely to get the job then a man trying for the same job with the same qualifications on a  scale woman in the st century are privileged yet complain about other peoples privilege and the best part is you think you can change things bahahah the first and second wave of feminism is what i agreed with this third wave is just pure bs this is why god brought the flood there is no such thing of a gender pay gap its utter bullshit,ABU
freelee should react to this,NOT
super happy for you make sure you are eating enough get the cronometer app to put in what you eat in day to ensure you are eating enough calories im sure freelee would be willing to couch you if you crave animal or animal products their are many delicious vegan brands like gardein follow your heart tofurkey daiya vegannaise and more watch earthlings cowspiracy and forks over knives take it one day at time,NOT
we are so proud of you trish what ever help you need we are here for you we would love to invite you over for din or take you out  share tons of delicious vegan weight loss food alex  kristin ,NOT
the wage gap is a lie,NOT
just  thing to say the number  cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels the number  cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels the cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels it is disgusting that people who know this attempt to blame it on cow farts just to help their hippie agenda,NOT
i just wish i had powers so that i can do a lot of harm to those humans in the video who are senseless and have no compassion towards our non human families saying that they are soulless those idiot news casters these humans for me personally are human scums,ABU
that it doesnt exist,NOT
just have one team only and everyone runs togetherlets see how they feel,NOT
youre so fucking disgusting you troll and spew all this ignorance for money youre trash,ABU
just so you know trish freelee doesnt get that body from diet alone she absolutely has to exercise diet isnt a cureall you also have to be careful on a vegan diet you can gain weight on it sugar is vegan so are french fries etc etc you still have to be smart about what you put in your body same with amount watermelon has got an insane amount of calories and sugar per cup than other fruits the sugars in fruit are also harder to digest and will turn into stored energy fat when you eat too much gaining weight from fruit i know its horrible but thats from experience ,NOT
there isnt any wage gap in the businesses but there is a skill and experience gap between the genders in the society some of this gap is caused by biology some are caused by social pressure,NOT
how does she get a pass every time she acts like the town fool shes a joke,NOT
trisha please dont,NOT
i cant with trisha anymore ,NOT
this isnt considered cheating but using steroids is,NOT
this channel shows clear leftwing bias,NOT
feminazi what about the pay gap women make c for every dollar a man makes you racist pig me the wage gap oh yeah just lets ask all the men who were on the titanic what they think about that oh wait,ABU
i feel sorry for her she seems so confused and mentally unstable she needs help shes alone with her own mind too much lol,NOT
i dont think she is trolling i think she is just really sad and confused and has identity issues,NOT
i honestly dont care about all of the drama or hate i love that freelees message is getting out there why does our generation highlight the less important shit like drama instead of what will help in the long run animals need to survive we cant keep killing them what about the future generation what if the majority of animals get extinct and they dont even know what they look like it makes me so sad,NOT
you are a woman you dont fucking choose to be a guy im literally a trans guy and this offended me so much most gay men ive been with actually havent cared that im trans you cant fucking choose a gender no matter what you think do a lot more research on terms first please i beg of you do not say gender from birth because most trans people have never felt their assigned gender please please just say sex you are female but you cant identify as a sex you can identify as a man or a woman or nonbi you can only be an ally and please do not misrepresent us dont even try to represent something you dont understand fully please,NOT
i wish all women were as smart as you,NOT
the wage gap goes a bit deeper than personal choices society has stemmed from patriarchal norms and in turn women are expected to work these jobs although this may seem like a choice from the women their choice is influenced by history and present day society yes these norms will be hard to change and nobody should expect them to change in any short period of time but opening up more choices for women and trying to learn from history so it is not repeated is a good way to get the ball rolling,NOT
whos truth christina we all see truth through our own lens its a motherhood tax watch netflix series explained  why women are paid less episode same facts different truths,NOT
most of the money men make is spent on or by women anyway,NOT
i really wish the both of you would fuck off trish wont stay vegan either chubby bitch,ABU

also y have a woman give this bs propaganda video ive noticed to seem more creditable u fks use ppl o push ur own agenda like the left does but more frequently im seeing foh,NOT
i like how this video doesnt just blame sexist employers and looks at the actual causes of the wage gap,NOT
because of the angry energy in the video i thought blaire was reacting out of feeling attacked by this so i did not expect her to make such good arguments well done girl,NOT
trish try seeds nuts and beans they are so so nutritious,NOT
i want to go vegan or a little bit but im not sure how to tell my parents becuase they think the vegan diet is unhealthy and i would need to substitute meats for other things to give me protein,NOT
if you want  just freeze bannans then put them in your blender and blend into theres no chuncks,NOT
i think yall b forgettin that shes a troll,NOT
hey vox what was your prediction for the president election,NOT
what is vegan is it a new animal to eat,NOT
when they have a period they can speak,ABU
i never really bought the whole gender wage gap as a real thing but i didnt exactly know how to actually argue what i thought but this video really made some great argument points thanks christina  prager u ,NOT
sign me up for the paralympics i identify as brain dead after seeing people feel bad for these cheater,NOT
want a real gender wage gap i was working in a factory setting where the ratio to menwomen was  the women were constantly handed easier tasks and complained about their tasks labor intensity often the men would be told to step in to fulfill the labor aspect for the women what really upsets me is that i along with other men working there are doing x a persons work while the women avoided a portion of their task and still gets paid as much or in lots of cases more traditionalism and equality dont mix well,NOT
ha ha men taking over where dem fem bots at,NOT
i disliked the video because i am against snowflake liberals that are in or are supporting the lgbtq community,ABU
thank you if have been talking to people about the wage gap many times most people either say  or much more than it actually is finally someone actually got i right though saying that the wage gap is a myth is not true since its still ,NOT
the message is good and the information is correct but the only reason i wont share it is that the statistics and numbers are displayed in such a biasedmisleading way the numbers are convincing enough no need to mislead using this display of the numbers,NOT
we need more subscribers and views,NOT
the  cents is because men usually work more overtime hours than women,NOT
are you going to comment on your instagram being deleted,NOT
look at channons channel channon rose what i eat in a day,NOT
omg the vocal fry is out of control,NOT
this is insane,NOT
watching this makes me so happy like i almost cry tears of joy because i just have so much love for all of my fellow vegans things are changing its a beautiful thing ,NOT
hey freelee do you think you can debunk the fact that lots of nutritionist are claiming soy milk causes cancer ,NOT
they do have an unfair advantage youre a dumbass if you dont think they dont have an advantage,ABU
most definitely would recommend watch vegan what i ate in a day videos definitely look up the channel hot for food and just find lots o vegan recipes just eating fruit and veggies can get very boring and not super fillings so would suggest finding lots of good recipes and stuff super happy to see you doing this even if it is just for  weeks ,NOT
id rather like to see bell curves of incomedistribution rather than merely talking about averages the issue eludes me at large the grand overall gap between the genders is irrelevant as except for this video the grand biological impact of children is almost always glossed over and the mother who doesnt want to focus on her little bundle of cries and diapers is nothing but a bad parent those times are what social security systemspolicies are for the only real relevant part is are you getting the same per hour for the same quality of work and the opposite is illegal in most civilised countries anyway if your quality lacks and therefore you get less than your peers and thats not enough for you look for a job that better suits your skillset a world where everyone is required to work shouldnt exist that is just a tyrannical exploitative hell im completely fine when one partner whoever it is is able to sustain their family alone freeing the other to focus on the family,NOT
the beginning already destroyed like  of feminists,NOT
i just wasted  min watching the stupid video,NOT
vegan now feeling amazing thins are changing for the betterfeeling great thanks for the wonderful movie ,NOT
i have been waiting for this ever since the video came out,NOT
how fucking desperate are you you have a public and private mental collapse on a regular fucking basis you have taken more dick than dozens of woman combined if you loved dick that much and repeatedly fell in love with hairy oafs of men you are not fucking trans you may also be into woman but you arent fucking trans but i hope you understand that you are going to have to live this shit down in a couple months when you decide that you are not only a female but you are a girly girl empty brained little psychotic female you are a god damned joke quit this shit,ABU
i have such a huge crush on christina hoff sommers ,NOT
so this video literally just proved that the wage gap myth doesnt exist its all based on hours,NOT
if kaitlin jenner can win woman of the year these  black trans women can be track stars,NOT
this isnt about race fair is fair no matter how much hormone suppressing theyre doing these teens still have a natural physical advantage because they were born male,NOT
when i turned  i binge watched what i eat in a day videos documentaries etc and went vegan over night as i realized my entire life nothing meant more to me than animals yet i ate them a year later i let my mental health become extremely bad and stopped eating plant based because i was wanting to destroy my body and didnt care about my own morals im now  and ive been plant based vegan again for four days and its staying this way no matter where life takes me,NOT
i kinda see where shes coming from though she identifies with her birth sex but she thinks of her energy as a male i dont think she meant that shes actually trans she probably just doesnt know the correct label for what shes feeling,NOT
trish im not confused youtube watch next im questioningtrish me wtf,NOT
so many based females referenced props,NOT
but i personally dont like telling people im going on a diet cause then they judge every thing they put in ur mouth ,NOT
have we lost our minds it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that boys are bigger stronger and faster than girls if an  year old male high school senior identifies himself as a  year old boy does that mean he gets to play baseball and football against them,NOT
didnt this video just prove the wage gap doesnt exist by proving that kids are the reasons why there is a gap if men took care of kids more wouldnt the gap shift to men or better yet just not have any kids and eliminate the gap,NOT
shouldnt the asshole sjws and feminazis be attacking this video where are they,ABU
since its summer a better alternative for ice cream is frozen bananas i like to slice them up and put them in the freezer and wala its soooo yummy  also for the dairy replacement you can try coconut milk cashew milk or almond milk up to you and the best of luck,NOT
i think this girl wants to be anything but her self she needs help no she is not trans,ABU
her chest is always out in her videos she loves having big breasts and she loves being a female,NOT
i think she may be non binary and just super confused and not able to explain how she feels in a way other ppl can understand i think shes just ignorant to terms and shes making it sound a lot more confusing than it really is,NOT
i dont buy this there is a lot of unsaid information regarding choiceand the unconscious bias that exists in the world it is perpetuated in the media in the schools at home girls are good at x and not at y so saying a girl has a choice to enter a stem related field blatently ignors the fact that girls are not encouraged like boys are encouraged to enter these higher paying fields,NOT
she is a fruitfly  a woman who lusts after gay men all the time,NOT
i have been reading the comments and many vegans are letting us vegans down saying after days you will fail blahblahblah it is disappointing that they dont seem happy for you because i am very supportive and proud of you and its sad that many vegans are against you and dont feel the same as i do towards you in this amazing decision,NOT
whispers hey guys watch the video before you comment,NOT
so based upon the bull shit wording by the state  a boy can simply walk up and say he identifies as a girl and thats that  proof me wrong,NOT
huh i went to the most liberal biased news source i knew of and im impressed vox covered this very well and i dont feel as if its biased,NOT
yea and now in her recent video shes doing a chicken mukbang,NOT
early crew love you blaire ,NOT
i love piers,NOT
they shouldnt run on the girls team at all they do i have an unfair advantage cuz males are biologically bigger and stronger than females its dumb that they are running,ABU
i hate industrial farming its pure horror but we are designed to eat meat but in a more humane way respectful and sustainable hunting being vegan wouldnt be possible without modern society such as b supplements or a mass of different fruits and veg being imported around the world to countries where it is not native hugh carbon footprint being vegan is being promoted despite its long term health issues because it is about control you cant survive being vegan unless you rely on the system you go off grid or be self sufficient you would die therefore is it not natural,NOT
you cant fully satisfy your partner if youre trans  yike,NOT
girl what kinda clownery is this,ABU
i used this video in my global perspectives class for high school as a counter to the arguments made by my teacher it was good to see some free thinking and fair debate,NOT
how does this video have k dislikes its literally  supported by facts and research papers,NOT
yes please do a video about what to eat as a vegan,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist the one study that said women make  cents to a mans dollar has almost nothing factored in if i work in nuclear science as a male im obviously going to make more money than a waitress people use this one inaccurate statistic as a weapon its sickening and its literally illegal to pay women less if you could pay women less why not hire all women itd cut  of expenses its because the wage gap does not exist,NOT
i know the vlog squad is having a fucking field day with this video i cant wait for jeff to bring it up in a podcast,NOT
they are not women,ABU
why so many dislikes,NOT
please dont eat those bananas until theyre spotty af,NOT
in an earlier video named war on boys from prageru christina hoff said that boys are lacking behind girls in academics and we need to change the system girls make the choice to study while boys dont as much in this video she says women have lower wages because of their choice of job and its completely okay it shows why prageru is one of the most biased youtube channels,NOT
omg yes yes yes omg,NOT
next thing you know feminists will start saying that women arent being let into higher paying jobs as much,NOT
you are so ,NOT
honestly this is one big reason why i have such a problem with all of the extra genders people come up with theyre supposedly fighting against gender norms but creating these new genders is basically saying if youre a guy with these feminine traits then you shouldnt be identifying as a guy and things like that it actually reinforces gender roles by saying youre only a guy if you act like a stereotypical guy and youre only a girl if you act like a stereotypical girl like no when i hung out with guys as a kid and tried to fit in with them that was just called being a tomboy nothing more its really not a big deal until you start throwing in all these extra genders and specifications on what it takes to be a specific gender,NOT
love you but kill myself was dumb,NOT
blaire you look so damn cute in black,NOT
literally the most toxic human being alive,ABU
well done guys really well done thank you shared ,NOT
ha lol feminists take that,NOT

it doesnt matter some feminist wont listen to facts its pathetic glad you put a good truth to this stupid myth,NOT
i make more then the women at my job and its made clear why on day one when the ship is going down women are the first one to get off and men die,NOT
make sure you find vegan hamburgers soyalmond milks vegan egg etc so you can eat similarly to how you ate before most vegans eat a lot more junk food than freelee so remember that you can always find vegan options of comfort food,NOT
im so excited for you ive been vegan for almost  months now and i love it one of my fav got to snacks is  frozen bananas which are really ripened  a few splashes of plant based milk  any kind of sweetener and then blitz it in a food processor super easy and fast i highly recommend ,NOT
lord help us all,NOT
these athletes dont feel like girls boys they are girlsboys respectively having said that i believe that in the legal regards to the matter it will have to be investigated by a panel if drs psychiatrists physiologists athletic specialists to see if ones chromosomal gender does give one an advantage in athletics as a gay man and a human being i demand this be investigated thoroughly and fairly also the father sounds absolutely stupid his number one concern should be his child their safety and loving them their health and education not a sport,ABU
it actually works out better for women who on the whole live longer than men why im sure the overwork and long hours that men work takes more of a toll on their health,NOT
how are there so many dislikes when the comment section seems to be in agreement,NOT
yesssss god bless you ,NOT
how about we all go post some nice comments on her channel to encourage her ,NOT
women just dont work as hard as men most stay at home and take care of the house or children i dont care if thats sexist its true,ABU
i cant i just cant,NOT
i admire trisha for being such a troll lmao btw ive been watching you for  years and you got a lot prettier,NOT

as a trans woman i find this hilarious knowing what trishas about i feel bad for the people struggling with identity crisis that are hurt by trishas trolling tho,NOT
crazy how vox has ignored this video completely also there is no wage gap it is an earnings gap dont bring up the race gap it is illegal the equal pay act of  made that illegal,NOT
yous were born men no matter how much u wanna say ur girls no matter how girly u feel no matter how much hormone pills u take youll never be able to change what nature intended u to be,ABU
i literally threw up when i saw that shes a sexy woman and  a woman lol,NOT
except it really doesnt exist because if a man and a woman both work the exact same job have the same quality of work and the same hours they will get paid the same wage gap would only be a real problem if women were getting paid less for the exact same work thats just discrimination the wage gap only exists because of how they measure wage difference,NOT
im betting you compare nurses to doctors in these studies as well wage gap is bullshit every woman in my life makes more than me and its not for my lack of trying,NOT
did they have penis ,ABU

shoenhead said this st but yes thank you,NOT
i dont get what the fuss is all about eating plants save lives animals and humans move more talk less and be kind to each other why is it so difficult to work towards one common goal take care of our only home as far as i know we have just one earth,NOT
i am so happy about the development of veganism in our society this year alone i know there is still way more to do but we are on our way hopefully we can finally make being vegan the new normal in ,NOT

wow an honest look into the wage gap,NOT
is there a version with french subtitles or dubbed to french theres so many french speakers that need to see it thank you for making this important film,NOT
trisha you are such an amazing being im glad you are trying this you definitely dont have to stay this way but just this is fantastic vegans can give you advice on food and vegan help in general you can look up vegan recipes and replacements for products like eggs meat milk etc there are so many fantastic recipes and you can easily create wonderful desserts that taste just like or possibly better than desserts with dairy and meat products it is best if you do your own personal research and find out for yourself if this vegan lifestyle is okay for you most vegetables and fruits have much more protein and healthy vitamins than meat and dairy products this is fantastic trish were so proud of you,NOT
i became a vegan too from freelee and recently got my sister into the lifestyle since then she has lost so much weight and saving the beautiful animals i love freelee and she is changing lifes and the only one who has the guts to tell u what the reality is about animal product keep doing what your doing never stop i love you and your message you are sending,NOT

i think we should start looking into the intelligence gap for everyone you have to be stupid to believe in the gender wage gap there is no other explanation,NOT
this is definitely a group of trump supporters,NOT
this is so ridiculous you know to have a big prick between your legs only to race girls  people are too coddled nowadays we have it too good and way to much time on our hands,ABU
shes just on the same thought process that leads sjws to invent another sexuality to describe themselves and of course not understanding that gender and sexuality are two different things seriously its like none of them get that is part of that process so since shes attracted to gay guys i guess she could call herself a homosexual also i want to be identified as king of all reality does that mean sjws have to pay me tribute while were at it im also native american and black so gimme some of that casino and reparations money if you dont youre a disgusting racist,ABU
im so h a ppy,NOT

equal pay act of   i can never remember which one it is most of it comes from overtime and the fact that men ask for raises more often alongside the actual jobs,NOT
no girl no do not fall into the you can eat as many calories as you want trap yes it can work for some people but there are a shit tonne of videos of vegans out there who talk about how they gained a lot of weight because they were under the impression that they could eat as much as they want and still lose weight yes you can eat more food due to the fact that fruit and veggies have lower calories but dont go crazy right off the bat do research  soooo many amazing vegan youtubers out there that have a variety of information dont just stick to one persons way see the diversity of vegan lifestyles and test them all out until you find what works best for you  maybe you wont be able to maintain the life style maybe youll fall off the wagon a few times but its okay im excited that you are trying this out  i believe in you,NOT

this is amazing news trish i would recommend reading the kind diet by alicia silverstone it truly is a kind book that helps people transition she also has a lot of yummy recipes ,NOT
i would suggest watching the documentary forks over knives its very informative and shows why animal products arent good for you and it gives you ideas of what you can eat on a vegan diet ive been vegan for four months and i recently when hclf high carb low fat and i would suggest eating whole foods definitely eat lots of carbs like bananas rice potatoes etc and do not calorie restrict a lot of vegan foods are low in calories therefore you can eat a lot more anyways im soooo happy for you,NOT
i expected freelee to be behind the camera with a gun pointed at her,NOT
lololololololololol this bitch wishes she could go vegan,ABU
its just common sense,NOT
 do you have proof to back that up except that great video,NOT
why does greger look so different from even last year he looks weird man,ABU
fuck veganism saturated fat is healthy it doesnt clog arteries saturated fat is important for the brain and it keeps cell structures strong saturated fatty acids are also needed for important signaling and stabilization processes in the body saturated fat is required for calcium to be effectively incorporated into bone saturated fats found in butter and coconut oil myristic acid and lauric acid play key roles in immune health excess refined sugar vegetable oils and smoking are what damages arteries the body uses cholesterol to heal the damaged arteries since cholesterol is important for tissue repair,ABU
i have a headachethanks,NOT
my crush turns out to be gay me a straight woman welp my crush is gay and i never wear makeup guess that obviously means im gay now,NOT

can blaire hire a graphic designer to make better merch,NOT
yeah trisha ate some damn chicken fingers and im not mad about it,NOT
if there ever was a wag gap then only women would be hired because they cost less,NOT
trisha is digging deeper holes for herself shes playing it off now as being genuinely hurt by the backlash shes receiving when i know for certain that she didnt expect to get it after posting shes playing the victim because she doesnt want to take responsibility for what she did wrong theres the tea she jst need to stop and admit that she did it for clout,NOT
plants cry out in pain when picked to eat they also turn c into good stuff how dare you vegans are climate killers,NOT
the real problem here is to put the man to attend kids and focus more on family not to create flexible working hours so that the woman take all the family responsibilities,NOT
just look at the ratio of like to dislikes,NOT
women wakeup the want to replace you,ABU
this is just attention seeking,NOT
lowkey inspired ngl lol,NOT
women want to invade all male dominated areas so why cant men do the samethese characters are menthey also still have their cocks which means they have no real commitment to being a trans womanif they were post opp then maybe they would have a case,ABU
theyre happy so that would in turn make me happy oklets let usain bolt compete and smoke you two in every single event and push you out of the sport and take your place in the championship and see if youre happy,NOT

lol i love that there are more dislikes than likes,NOT
so ur subscribed to trish but u hate on her,NOT
shes going to be so hungry all the time you need protein you need some beans tofu avacado even bread all the fruit you bought for a true vegan will be gone in  sitting,NOT
personally i think if you are blind you shouldnt have a drivers license and if you have a pair of testosteroneproducing huevos you shouldnt compete in womens sports,ABU
there are  genetic differences between men and women in this case boys and girls six thousand five hundred genetic differences that are not changed with hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery to allow these boys and they are boys to compete in a girls sport category is wrong why isnt there a coed team or a transgender team they should not compete on a girls team because they are not girls even if they identify as girlschoose to live their lives as girls etc dont misunderstand me every person deserves to live according to their own free will but that does not entitle you to compete on a female team when you are genetically male  genetic differences its called science bitches,NOT
how has she been with women and saying that one of the reasons shes trans is because shes attracted to gay men  im a little confused,NOT
in my government and economics class i have a friend who is a feminist whenever she talks about the wage gap topic she brings up the fact that her mom who was a doctor was payed less than other doctors in the same field i dont remember what kind of doctor she was i just couldnt agree with her with this example as her evidence i knew for a fact that there were way to many factors that went into an individuals pay for the reasoning to just be women arent being treated equally im sure there are other true examples of inequality but they must be very rare and small cases that are also probably resolved quickly i dont see why people have to assume all the statistics correlate or have anything to do with each other they just show whats happening not how its happening,NOT
theres a study by the berau of labor statistics that shows in fine enough detail same job different pay they do not state anything about employers but it does highly suggest a wage gap exists theory higher paying companies tend to hire more men for whatever reasons this would create a pay difference not seen anywhere but statistics only way i can imagine wage gap existing and that study really does suggest it does also jobs that will match your pay from one place in order to hire you thatd be another way unequal pay could exist then femtards take this sliver of fact and go nuts with it,NOT
while everyone else is arguing about the wage gap im sitting here wondering how graduates only  year out of business school are making between k  k on average,NOT
she shouldve done a bit more research before making her video and told everyone from the start its not a troll video and shes  serious i do think she is genuinely super confused about her identity,NOT
react to the video dough armstrong is mcdonalds  beef,NOT
this is so awesome freelee you should check out a vid i made just for you  as to why i went vegan and how you saved my health mentally and physically love you xo,NOT
beautiful love this thank you so so much for sharing this its public and its accessible to anyone which is awesome the content is also not difficult to understand which is another a excellent excellent job pbn ,NOT
freelee i truly used to dislike you and your message because of how harsh it can sometimes seem but the more i watch the more i like you and the more i want to become vegan like you say you dont have to like me but you have to hear me and i have could you possibly make a video about converting to veganism while youre still living with your parents my parents think veganism isnt healthy because they arent informed and when i explain why its actually good for you they get frustrated with me and dont let me really go through with it is there any advice you could give thank you,NOT
implementing a plant based eating discipline this year reminded me of tom hanks in cast away eating slimy crab and coconuts with plants all over the place all to himself lol,NOT
this fucking cheaters  stupid americans,ABU
envy is what god doesnt want,NOT
you can still have coffee if you choose althought stimulants is bad for you but just substitue the dairy for almond milk or soy but stay away from a lot of soy because its gets your hormones out of wack,NOT
born man dna always man born female dna always female they know its wrong,NOT
so cutie yaaaaaasss,NOT
im not fully vegan but my diet does consist mostly of a vegan nature and once you start going vegan you start to see all these amazing changes in yourself you can do like me and just look up as much as you can on how to transition or ask friends and family for their support one thing i absolutely am in love with and have for breakfast every morning is a smoothie my favorite is a green smoothie i know theres a lot of ways to make it too the way i like it is with either spinach or kale and a variety of delicious fruits ie pineapple strawberries and any other kind of berries mango apples bananas kiwis pomegranate just any delicious fruit that you like you can make them with yogurt kale and,NOT
i would also suggest looking into what i ate in a day videos on yt for recipes and inspo,NOT
shes not trans but that would only mean she has another mental illness i genuinely think shes confused and tries to find her identity she doesnt have the vocabulary to express herself and thats why shes contradicting herself you cant cancel a human being she feels fluid and thats why she needs a therapist she doesnt have to apologise for her confusion just like we shouldnt believe her and we shouldnt think she lies because we dont know imagine if shes right then all of the hate right now is suicide fuel for her,ABU
you can get a starbucks coffee frap with coconut milk ,NOT
so vegans how much money are you making out of this,NOT
i try to put her thoughts as if im having those thoughts and feelings i dont get it this is seriously and mental disorder,ABU
women should get paid less there weaker can complain more if women keep complaing let them have all the jobs and just watch how messed up things get,ABU
well i identify as a size   year old and you have to fucking respect that and believe me yes im aware the scale says im  and my dl says i was born in  you have to respect what i say that i am ,NOT

id agree if hed shave his moustache i just cant get enough of these videos lol big muscular bois competing with women and being proudhahaha so sad its funny,ABU
hah according to trishas definition of trans i technically qualify i dont care about covering my zits ive totally thought a guy was hot only to find out that he was gay and im assertive and im definitely not trans ,NOT
women choose jobs that pay less why should jobs like nursing or childcareteaching jobs pay less in the first place,NOT
im a trans feminine man,NOT
i didnt go vegan i went plant foods whole foods  veganism is a religion i could care less if one slaughters cows pigs or goats goes fishing with a net  crabs with a cage or cuts off the heads of chickens  but i am sure vegans do and i bet  of them are pro choice because killing a baby is ok but dont touch my chicken  its almost like vegans want to live in a perfect rain forest with chickens pigs goats cows and worms pisses me off they dont give a shit about humans health diabetes heart attacks and cancer,NOT
fair play to vox you were the last people i expected to make a video like this i understand you are still hyperliberal but we all appreciate these types of factual rather than ideological videos,NOT
if you need meat then sietan is great and maco teat but the maco teat has soy protien isolate which isnt good but my husband is a body builder and is vegatarian so thought id help you,NOT
ive been vegan for  year now and im glad you are going vegan but you still have to track youre calories so in my opinion trust me i have been through it  so eating as much calories as you want is bullshit,NOT

leaving parents wondering nigga you sound dumbwondering isnt it obviousare yall crazy,ABU
with trisha the thing is that u dont know like never if shes making a joke or not ,NOT
by trishas definition i too am a gay man ,NOT
the thing is women and men would earn the same if they are in the same job and have the same credentials the so called wage gape is comparing the average earning of men to women so there really isnt any problem with that,NOT
gender fluid pansexual im l o s t,NOT
trish check out that vegan couple video response  it has so much good information ,NOT
preach why dont the women complaining about the wage gap drop their jobs as school teachers and actually work for something such as an engineer as a woman my whole life ive always wanted to become a chemical or computer engineer and i am making it a reality through dedication and making it into a great engineering school women cant complain about the wage gap if they arent going to work important jobs,NOT
chicks with dicks lol  they have male dna they are stronger naturally any one who says they dont is a dumbfuck just like the dude who wants to be a girl is dominating his high school wrestling class  and why do we worry about so few when so many disagree snowflakes and crazy lgbtqrstuv fucktards run the country the usa is going down the shitter,ABU
prageru seems to be the only right wing college out there,NOT
slaughter videos are not what really happens i personally have been to many different slaughter houses and every single one i have been to ethically treats the animals i personally raise sheep and am in h and ffa it pains me to see others believe lies about agriculture so dont believe everything you see,NOT

i must show this to my teacher,NOT
the girls shouldnt participate with them,ABU
im so happy you are trying this lifestyle out,NOT
i think the best advice i could give is to get rid of all the meat dairy and eggs that are in your kitchen and fill your fridge and cupboards with plenty of vegan friendly options dont be afraid of carbs whole plant carbs like potatoes rice and oats will be your best friend as well as pasta if you eat pasta with some low fat tomato pasta sauce with some vegetables and potatoes its a really awesome and filling lunch or dinner do make sure youre eating enough get the fruit the starches and the veg in and eat as much as you want good luck with your vegan journey trish im very proud of you for stepping up and giving it a try xx,NOT
the fact people who say that the wage gap actually exist disgust me if you are a company all you care about is profit then no men would ever work ever again because all companies would hire women because its less of an expense it is also income not wage income is less because it is proven that women dont work as much as women and does not work as much overtime as men americans all live in a very very privileged life and the fact that you say women are less then men is just an excuse for their failures the fact that men have to pay more for car insurance is that definition of institutional sexism so dont say pink tax is a thing the fact that i have to go to the korean military to regain citizenship and a women doesnt is inequality,NOT
ok so what i got from this is that she just wants a shorter haircut because she doesnt like brushing her hair,NOT

be sure to get ur ricepastabeanspotatoesfruitsvegetables in also make sure u eat enough and till ur full bcs as a vegan u dont have to restrict,NOT
oh nohunny no,NOT
about time people dispelled this bullshit it is  after all come on guys,ABU
shes a motherfucken teletubbie ,NOT
theres clearly some numbers here that make sense but i bet if u make the variables more commonexperience and seniority and productivity and actual individual cases we would see virtually no difference and of course women are going to have more inclusion in raising the child in the earlier years its just nature that why you they produce milk and actually give birth proper men put it on themselves to become better bread earners in order to support their family and theres nothing wrong with that its crazy to think that theres people out there who think these gender roles are oppressive and misogynistic if i was a women i would have no issue taking maternity leave to take care of my new child while i know my husband is working hard for our families future,NOT
i got a prageru ad on a prageru video xd,NOT
do you realize that youre one of the reasons why the trans community isnt taken seriously i dont wanna hurt the trans community youre hurting them with this video take this shit down and get a therapist,NOT
every job i have had men and women got paid the same wage and yet i can create a wage gap very simply within that job example my wife and i work in the same job doing the same hours and getting the same hourly wage we both start the job at  years old and work until we retire we dont have kids and both take the same days off but my wife earns less than me how retirement age  men are forced to work for  years more than women in the uk even though women live longer so even if i we get the exact same wage  it results in a pay gap the gap being the  years wages the man earns extra because he cant claim a pension at the same age on top of that  paying a woman less than a man for the same job is against the law  so if the pay gap was this big then most women would be taking the employer to court and winning which is very easy to do if this is the case focusing on the pay gap in this way is useless and it does not actually look at problems with wages for both men and women  paying the top person in a museum  a year when the rest of the staff are volunteers is wrong political staff being given  for travel an food each day when they only live  miles away is wrong zero hours contracts so that people can be screwed over by the company they work for is wrong both men and women are getting screwed over with regards to wage issues and focusing on a wage gap which is already abolished by law is the least of the problems,NOT
organic dates rolled in coconut flakes yummmm you can get them at wholefoods,NOT
my sister dont believe me say that there a huge gap men get paid more just because there men,NOT

wage gap does not exist,NOT
i dont think shes trans but i dont think shes faking either this is a trama induced dissociation dissociative identity disorder the anxiety panic attacks crying into multiple meltdowns forgetting chunks of memory the low vibe moments switching to sporadically hyper i dont think shes faking and i dont think shes crazy this is some heavy trama she blacked out i think she needs to see a psychiatrist,NOT

go to mommytang she is vegan,NOT
you took a survey of men and women who graduated okay did every single man and woman go into the exact and job no they problem with this gap does not bring into the choice that women choose versus men,NOT
the wage gap is bull and women dont want to make more money this is larger due to the fact that men are more risky and are willing to work more theyre also more greedy these things are not bad women are and always will be better parents,ABU
the c in the dollar figure is a worthless raw figure it doesnt ake into account hours danger unpleasant working conditions or anything else that might affect pay any discussion that didnt start from that knowledge is worthless,NOT
mommy tang and hot for food are the best channels to help you on your vegan journey,NOT
this shouldnt be sensitive at all its biologically unfair,ABU
the fact that she made an apology video but left this up shows that she isnt sorry at all the fucked up part is i really dont think she has bad intentions i think she is just selfsabotaging selfinvolved and socially unaware but the road to hell is paved with good intentions and even if she somehow justified this in her mind as meaning no harm there is no excuse for ignorance of this level this video is just so tone deaf it gives me a headache and i truly hope she figures herself out off camera ,NOT
i have to say i used to be one of those people who hated on you i now feel like i owe you an apology though yes i still believe you are harsher than necessary but i now see where you are coming from and you are part of the reason i am going vegan so thank you freelee ,NOT
if after factoring in choice the wagegap shrinks to only  cents for every dollar that means that choice isnt responsible for a small wagegap the  cents dollar is the result after accounting for choice this means that women are paid less on average some women are likely paid significantly less than male peers working the same jobs while in other companies women are on par with their coworkers yes a large component of the lager wage gap  cents for every dollar is due to job choice however it does not fully account for the wage gap and  cents to every dollar is still a significant gap,NOT
i totally agree with you masculinity abd femininity are social constructs in the sense thar men have to be masculine and women have to be feminine trisha hasnt once stated that she has had these feeling before had dressed up twice as a boy has not passed either times btw and has never displayed dysphoric tendencies even watchinf the video clips im looking at her and spotting her god damn nails she has put money into her body to portray herself as female time and time agian and its irritating that she has no idea what shes talking about i truely feel sorry for her,NOT

make a patreon and ill donate monthly,NOT
piers morgan is just an awful person hes disgusting,ABU
child thats transgender and plus you didnt choose to be schizophrenic you were kind of born with it ,NOT
but isnt that the point of the wage gap to show that there is an overall difference in compensation yes of course that is not because some evil managers want to pay less money but because of personal choices which are a direct product of influences from our society there is a wage gap though it is not a matter of paying more or less but of a social issue that makes woman and men tend to different carreer choices i guess some people manipulate everything its just a shamr because the concept behind it is nice and would help both woman and men,NOT
thank you for being smart,NOT

im seeing all these fast food joints serving vegan options and im sitting here like damn get to the healthy vegetable part of this im not a vegan but i would like to be i was vegetarian for close to a year and while i never took it very seriously it was relatively easy to do vegetables are delicious animals have feelings more and more ive felt remorse and just flat out gross while eating meat i hope i can make the transition soon,NOT
my vegan macaroni and cheese amazing  to  finley sliced onions sauteed until golden brown in olive oil and coconut oil then add  mils of water  mils of coconut milk tablespoon of all purpose seasoning small teaspoon of curry powder  whole cauliflower broken up into chunks boil until soft then blend add macaroni,NOT
that its not there,NOT
why underestimate women whatever they bring im sure many will use that as an example to know theyll have to go a little bit harder we oooh so equal but this is unfair,NOT
what the fu c k,NOT
carbs carbs carbs bananas mangos bananas mangos rice pasta,NOT
quick question i often hear about workplace danger as one variable that would result in men earning more but dangerous jobs dont actually pay particularly well at least from what ive found how does this variable affect the wage gap,NOT
im vegan and ive got a couple of things to say about this nothing negative i promise first off i think what you said about if freelee would be nice in her youtube videos if she would people wouldnt watch when she does shocking things people do watch there are sooooo many vegan youtubers out there that are nice but none of them are as popular as freelee second what you do need to realise is that having a vegan diet wont magically make you lose weight the only thing is that vegan things are generally less dense in calories although they do fill you up thats why when people go vegan they will lose some weight in the first few weeks but then when your body starts craving those calories you will stop losing weight unless you obviously go high carb low fat like freelee because thats just a really good way to lose weight slowly and healthily and third i would recommend eating lots of fruit and not too much other food for now for these two weeks to lose weight quickly for the video but if you want to stick with it you should definitely eat more rice potatoes beans legumes bread and meat replacers since they are the things that will fill you up most and they will have enough calories to keep you going if you eat too little calories you will feel horrible and blame veganism although really youre just not eating enough and then last my favorite thing about veganism and i think yours too is you get to eat so much more even with processed food vegan things tend to have less calories so you get to eat more without having more calories i hope youll make the right choice after these two weeks the right choice for your own health for the animals and for the planet if you want to educate yourself further i would recommend watching cowspiracy and earthlings although earthlings only shows animal abuse as where cowspiracy shows more environmental issues,NOT
feminists cant complain on this video,NOT
i mean this only effects girls it would be a disadvantage vise versa,NOT
i know how you feel but its called being a tomboy trish ,NOT
you go girl  we support you ,NOT
trisha looks like she was beaten with a beehive,ABU
men and women are physically differentcommon sense dumb motherfuckas,ABU
omg this make has made my day i mean i am vegan and i have seen freelees video and found out about her and she loved meat but now that she is vegan ya know it is so good that we are one person closer to animals being free i am so happy about her being vegan now and i hope every vegan can now support her even if she is just going to be vegan for to weeks as long as she tries i am so happy so keep going trsh keep going,NOT
so proud of you trish its so great that you want to eat healthfully instead of starving yourself to loose weight please remember though that you might not loose weight within two weeks and i hope youll stick with veganism anyway we all know that weight loss doesnt happen overnight and takes months or years so please dont give up on being vegan if you dont see fast results my tips for being and staying vegan are  fuck all the vegan diets like rt sorry freelee fully raw etc all you need to do is eat whole plant foods by this i mean basically anything from the produce section of the store also beans legumes lentils pasta rice oats  try new things find a recipe that looks yummy and make it try to veganize your old favorites try the vegan meatcheese alternatives know that there will be things you love and things you hate but thats just a part of the process  prepare food ahead of time make sure you have something to snack on or have lunch prepared before you get hungry so you dont give up and get fast food or something this also applies to going out to eat research the menu ahead of time so your not flustered when you get there  read all the labels every single packaged thing you buy please read the labels never assume that something is vegan companies love to sneak milk fat or skim milk into everything  its not just about you i know you are doing this mainly for health reasons which is completely fine but its so helpful to remember and think about all the lives you are saving by eating this way when it gets tough just know you are helping animals and the earth  i really hope this helps you trish im so happy for you ,NOT
no one these days can live a healthy life without topping up with vitamins eating murdered animals does not bring any of the nutrients claimed by the food industry a big con from way back the animals are fed tainted poisoned food nothing healthy about that besides the plus of a healthy cuisine the ethical part for me are the animals this is an upgrade in civilization and humanism weve known the past littered with lies  colonization slavery womens rights for all there was an explanation and voices standing in horror to those who fought against it vegan cuisine is spectacular living with no blood in our hands mouth or guts is sanity and compassion b magnesium iron vitamin c should be taken by everyone and topped up with regular check ups this is for everyone i see people of  where i live looking old old terrible colour bent over limping miserable diabetes the said marvelous mediterranean cuisine they eat the eyes the paws the entrails and theyre paying the huge price vegan is everything good and more its not about the food its about the inability for many people to take responsibility for what is good for them booze drugs pharma drugs smoking guzzling food everything that is bad they fight back not because its bad but because theyre wimps addicted and unable to fight back the very person who wrote to me is so miserable its pathetic,NOT
you can still get delicious frapuccinos from starbucks just ask them to replace the milk with soymilk and no whip cream it taste exactly the same no lie anyways congrats girl youre gonna feel and look so good,NOT
theres too many women that are willing to live off men,NOT
oh look vox has has finally caught up,NOT
i always thought my life would be easier if i had that part sweetie thinking your life would be easier if you had a dick does not make you transgender being trans is a condition that we are literally born with smfh this is why nobody takes real trans people seriously they see people like this,NOT
huh actually good content only thing i would have added is that the  most likely does contain some meaningful amount of sexism in it instead of saying other variables would narrowit to the point of vanishing,NOT
brave new world deal with it people,NOT
are you talking about a wage difference or an annual earnings difference because that is the common issue with this topic the wage is the same its the annual earnings that are different,NOT
no baby no that dont make no sense ,NOT
i also dont think penis envy is weird for straight women and i dont think vagina envy for straight men is weird people just wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex sometimes its not uncommon doesnt mean youre trans,NOT
i blame birth control theyre not ovulating anymore want effeminate men and get into community organizing instead of propagating the species you dont see this shit in countries where the people arent wacked out on hormones and meds,ABU
its because the top pay comes from hardest physical work,NOT
if businesses and companies pay women  cents for every dollar a man makes wouldnt employers only hire women so they can save money on labor costs,NOT
falafels are nice theyre great with hummus and rice  in a vegan burrito im not personally vegan or vegetarian but its nice to have something thats vegan every once in a while in my opinion,NOT
dear god no,NOT
wouldnt that be a salary gap then,NOT
do i identify as transgender  do i identify as the gender i was born as  bitch which are then,NOT
they are on hormone therapy does no one here understand how that doesnt put them at a disadvantage everyone has testosterone people have hormonal embalances too naturally should they not compete there are girls with over abundance of testosterone and a lack of estrogen and vise versa in both men and women if they are getting the blockage and the estrogen hormone therapy the real reason why they are beating that girl in the case is because shes too focused on harming others opportunities to work on her techique if she worked out more and was just as detemined dedicated and hard working as they are maybe shed win a race but no got to get mommy to fight her battles because shes lazy,NOT
mommy n daddy are trans,NOT
deep throating a banana the trish style dead freelee,NOT
why cant the world wake up to this,NOT
what about how the wage gap affects people of color,NOT
baby carrots are good with hummus and hummus comes in all different flavors what i do is protein shakes and coffee but the protein shakes in lactose free i normally drink almond milk and i cut the sugar and cut eating bread and not so much cheese because it makes me bloat lol,NOT
it also doesnt take into account the stem jobs like construction and things of the hard labor that men usually do now it has nothing to do with the thought that one sex is stronger than the other but more to the fact that women dont usually take those jobs also the fact that scientifically men are usually more competitive and will take longer hours,NOT
trisha cant go vegan cause shes addicted to meat shes a pig that cant stop eating,ABU
yesssss this is ironicccc,NOT
tang gang yeyeye,NOT
glad to see this is spoken by a woman so that there is no excuses for the feminists ,NOT
i havent watched a video of hers in years and i am not trying to make fun of her looks but to me she looks seriously ill seriously like she is on some insane drugs very sad,ABU
maybe im not empathetic enough but literally all i got from this is i am a very confused pansexual cis woman last i heard genderidentitysexuality,NOT
maybe its just in my head but people just become so much more beautiful when they speak up for animals,NOT
i dont like being center of attentionunless i wanna be center of attention,NOT
frozen bananas  banana ice cream ,NOT
it makes me sick god please stop this,ABU
its sad because she needs drama to stay relevant,NOT
they look like strapping black males with long hair it is not fair and never will be,ABU
when you go to starbucks order your drink with soy or coconut milk,NOT
there is a complete lack of moral values in this country this is shameful and insane,ABU
is it ok to be a vegan at  years old  and i need help on things to eat i need help please,NOT
but my professer said youre wrong reeeeeeee,NOT
if they want to compete so they can feel like they fit in let them just give the trophy to the first place biological woman,ABU
the only thing more insane than telling the world to stop eating meat is to tell them that plantbased meat is the answer its laughable really insanely laughable,NOT
freelee i love you so fucking much you helped me get over my anorexia and im so grateful for that i have been vegan now for about  months and i feel better than ever thank you ,NOT
there is always goiung to be a wage gap that feminists will complain about men may work longer hours and there are more male workers and the equal pay act of  is manditory,NOT
no they shudnt this is madness why cant ppl be their gender and stop this nonsense you are born a male therefore u are a male take all de hormones u want u will be biologically male till death,ABU
about  minutes of absolute nonsense,NOT
the video ive been waiting for,NOT
plant based youre going plant based if you were going vegan youd get rid of all leather and products that are animal tested on this is coming from me who is not even a vegan im a vegetarian,NOT
dont give in to the eat as much as you want if its vegan mentality its extremely unhealthy also moral absolutionism will hinder you more than help and since youre not fully a vegan for moral reasons if its extremely hard for you to avoid animal products if youre out with friends or something then just do it if youre comfortable with that good luck in the next two weeks,NOT
girl u love fast food too much,NOT
theres a huge wage gap between the nba and wnba d,NOT
lowkey was about to unsubscribe until she started explaining it instead of playing the victim card,NOT
mr and mrs vegan on youtube and instagram are amazing for health yummy food weight loss ,NOT
about  thats the actual wage gap economists settled on when they took into consideration the different factors that lead to different incomes in the same jobs obviously it varies and it isnt absolutely equal however this article does a very good job of making it seem like the gap is still much bigger than that  when all of those factors are taken into consideration,NOT
based on the things that she says in this video i believe that she may be genderqueer in some way however this video is in very poor taste and incredibly poorlyinformed i really wish she had handled it better especially since she has the responsibility of having a platform,NOT
god bless this woman,NOT
im so tired of people identifying as trans or theythem just because its popular its a fad a trend and definitely clickbait for big youtubers its like you said just do you you dont have to be trans to be more masculine or feminine or neither tbh just ugh people come on,NOT
this is amazing trish just make sure you eat enough,NOT
trisha has borderline personality disorder and is having an identity crisis thats literally it,NOT
this is the most insidiously mysandristic wage gap video on youtube it is good propaganda though it disguises false premise as hard fact and sells antimale bigotry as profemale progressiveness nice job vox this is your worst video so far,NOT
glistening in the wind ,NOT
every time a crazy feminist is asked for evidence wage gap all men r   ,NOT
women take lowerpaying jobs those jobs are lowerpaying because we dont value the work that women do,NOT
this on the right path by looking in to specific data that goes into the grossly misleading wage gap but even this draws ways too easy and broad conclusions there needs to be flexibility to account for the variety of working decisions woman make throughout their career the main focus should be on educating girls that they should be excited for any job that catches their eye like how nurses are still a taboo job for men we have to get girls visualising themselves succeeding in male dominated roles elsewhere we should all be sharing info on our income to help all us in negotiating better salaries this should help disclose any lingering gender pay inequities as for the family thats up to the family to figure out if they want to have kids and this vid is promoting sexism by saying just mums have to work around their kids if thats how it is in your family thats your choice at the very least thats a social cultural issue not a pay work issue,NOT
go vegan but fuck freelee,ABU
having a dick doesnt make u assertive idk theres so many things wrong dude if u wanna be identified a guy then ure a guy but this video was just offensive,NOT
 butthurt feminists who deny facts disliked this video,NOT
i have never clicked a video faster ive been vegan for around  months and it makes me feel and look so much healthier be sure to buy very dense fruits such as mangoes and dates  waterbased fruits have less calories and will leave you feeling pretty hungry throughout the day another thing you can make are vegan burritos with beans rice avocados and you can add beefless crumbles if youd like i  recommend gardein meat substitutes if you begin craving meat  their chicken tenders beefless burgers and pork sliders are so delicious remember to carb the f up potatoes rice and healthy breads and pastas are your best friend make sure to check the breads and pastas for eggs and milk they do not make you gain weight but provide glucose to your brain and keep you from being hungry throughout the day you should do a vegan taco bell mukbang everything there could be made vegan i love the  layer burrito with no cheese no sour cream and add potatoes and pico xx,NOT
why celebs are not making noise on the homeless issue  why,NOT
is trisha doing hardcore drugs or something she looks terrible,ABU
probably not for long,NOT
good for you you can do it do it for the animals ,NOT
if you wanna go vegan take it seriously please dont post pictures of you eating chicken and waffles online,NOT
if being transgender isnt superficial then why do trans women undergo thousands of dollars of painful surgery take hormones and adopt certain mannerisms to conform to societys stereotypes of women or is trans territory exclusively for males,NOT
share this video,NOT
people so fast to get offended shes obviously confused about the meaning of what being transgender means why get offended when shes just trying to figure herself out and sharing it i guess its wrong to share your feelings nowadays without people choosing to get offended instead of being understanding and kindly explainingsharing your opinions on why her perspective of transgender is wrong you all bash her and shame her i though lgbt was supposed to support and help each other im disappointed at the reactions making a joke out of someones real feelings and shaming them the negativity makes me sick,NOT
of k is k interesting maths,NOT
where are the feminists now,NOT
in other countries however this actually happens,NOT
cool video but i see some inaccuracies first off you say the  cents difference exists is because of choices but that  cent number comes up when you have already factored in the difference in choices on top of that the visual is misleading because it shows the difference shrinking from  cents to  cents which is not the case the difference shrinks from   cents to  cents and then you just completely dismiss the  cents oh well we have no idea why the gap is there but just believe us when we say it doesnt exist bad way to make a video then just say the wage gap is so much smaller then a lot of us think,NOT
i think you can be a guy some days and then i think you can be a girl whatever she said boi aint that gender fliud,NOT
 transgender games case closed,NOT
blair is honesty my favourite person on earth ,NOT
im not crying youre crying,NOT
its the babies kill the babies,ABU
its so interesting that youve never used the fact you are trans as evidence of your claim like so many people who say if you arent transblackfemale etc you cant talk about blah blah blah even though that act is so subtle in your videos i think its a really powerful move anyway you dissected this well and i hope you are right about this whole thing being a fad even if it fades out soon itll still leave a huge dent in the progress for lgbt acceptance your words are comforting i just hope you are right,NOT
 feminists dislikes this video,NOT
future is vegan,NOT
only reason male sport players get paid more is because its a reality show and more people watch them,NOT
someone pick up my jaw off the floor pls,NOT
i went vegetarian in  and in  i am actually going vegan i know i cannnn,NOT
tldr the wage gap is a myth,NOT
not necessarily a wage gap issue but the cost of being a woman is higher than the cost of being a man just look at deodorant prices for example,NOT
the stupidity is too high with this wage gap  stop calling it a wage gap because it was never about wages it was about earnings  then add more truth to it and specify median yearly earnings gap that way we can understand what the hell we are actually talking about  then you look at the worked hours per year and you will see the same gap surprise not because it is totally illegal and economically stupid to pay different amounts to different people doing the same work  and in the end you can simplify to median worked hours gap so to summarize the false male hating feminist narrative of wage gap it is in reality a simple median worked hours gap and we can all go to rest knowing that men work more therefore earn more and we can also focus on what is important if we actually care about the gap to allow women work more hours but because we all know that feminists and libtards never ever cared about the real issue and they are all in for male bashing they will continue to use the debunked false wage gap narrative i can bet you  that  years from now i will open a leftist feminist website and i will read another stupid male hating gender wage gap article that paints all women as victims and all men as predators because why the hell not,ABU
man i want to go to school here,NOT
i totally agree with this video,NOT
i wish you wouldnt call it a dietbecause veganism isnt something thats temporary its a commitment and change of lifestyle that requires a lot of thought planning and motivation it just seemed like you dont really understand the full extent good for you for trying it out though i hope you stick with it,NOT
there are so many variations of that that no one can cover them all neither do you it can be  percent in one study and  in another the point is that no matter how you flip ittheres always a gap in favor of men that indicates a real problem and not just lies you can see that is backed up by every study done,NOT
the truth is that freelee is good at what she does and shes a good enough leader for the vegan movement theres always room for improvement in everything and everybody being completely positive would be nice in a puppies  sunshine world that we dont live in it would be good for her image but the truth is that controversy sparks peoples interest and thats what freelee does she speaks up questions calls people out on their bullshit she does shit sitting back and making what i eat in a day videos is fine i love those videos too but veganism needs exposure most people arent vegan not because they dont want to but because theyre clueless as to whats really happening and freelee plays an important role in just that raising awareness and since the youtube community and the world in general if you ask me is fueled by drama and controversy that is exactly what she does and shes pretty good at it say what you will but shes authentic at the end of the day she does what has to be done and shes honest about it keep rocking,NOT
trisha paytas is out of her mind,ABU
this is stupid as fuck,NOT
she had chicken on her snapchat story today lol,NOT
yassss gurrlll make sure you research  and learn everything you can,NOT

i work in a warehouse where they actualy pay quite good its male dominated job obviously anyway they decided to start recruit women who actualy managed to stay  days max and left because they couldnt handle thy physical job,NOT
the question is why do they make the choices,NOT
these girls look like dudes,ABU
we all new this vid was going to come,NOT
great work freelee ,NOT
women are choosing to raise children and thats what is increasing the gap so its their fault yeah ill believe that when paid paternity leave is a thing i guarantee most women who choose to leave their jobs because of giving birth do it because the husband cant get paternity leave make paternity leave a thing and i guarantee the gender wage gap will decrease right now american society basically forces women to leave their jobs unless they already have enough money for private child care and most dont,NOT
i think some of the gap can be down to how well men  women negotiate i have a totally awesome  strong female friend who recently negotiated salary for a new position and she just couldnt push hard on the salary the employer played it down in the range and my friend took the middle ground her skills are awesome and shes an absolute dream asset in her field but she just wouldnt push for the top end money i think guys are more likely to do that,NOT
very unfair get a period,ABU
piers morgan rocks ,NOT
there are only  gendersscience,NOT
 thousand retards disliked this lol,NOT
 business depends on the company and the economy if i work for a small business i will be paid less than a corporation  there is the equal pay act of  or  i always get the  years mixed up so you can sue  women usually work with jobs that are more for emotional reasons and a good chunk of them pay less than jobs like engineering  dont forget that part time jobs do pay less im just saying look at these things before saying there is a pay gap,NOT

 equal pay act look it up,NOT
half the commenters just saw wage gap in the title got triggered then disliked at least watch the video,NOT
i just want discrimation groups to die in the usa things are already pretty pc and im tired of everything everyone says being hyper analyzed by these bloodthirsty people dicks in hands racismsexism isnt even defined by intent anymore just by the multitude of topics that could possibly offend ugh maybe the united states just needs a major bombing to set our priorities straight,ABU

mentally physically and emotionally no black individual can ever be beat,ABU
if its just dietisnt it just a plant based diet instead of going vegangoing vegan means you gotta throw out all your animal tested productsget rid of all animal product clothing esp those beautiful handbagsany shoesthings around your house and so on,NOT
vox smarter than buzzfeed,NOT
look look at your dislikes thats a clear message,NOT
vox is wage the rate which employees are paid per time givenproject ex hr project or is it the accumulated money earned with a specific range of time ex yearly monthly as for the pew research about share of house work did it account if the mother and father both working full time have equal or close earning potential if a father who earns  in a year while the mother earns  in a year wouldnt it be logical if the mother bear the brunt of house hold chores while the father takes the opportunity to push his career for bigger paycheck i would say it is the first time i saw a study that tackles gender gap in careers and actually use appropriate data,NOT
create more categories for those transgender idiots men women transmen transwomen dog car stone tree whatever the fuck they think they are,ABU
where i come from we dont have this problem cause our society is built on families rather than on individuals you live with your parents and contribute in the house money but still everyone has his own money and own property you leave your parents house when you are ready to start your own family and both partners contribute in the house money and it is the same for men and women,NOT
vox great video,NOT
you look so sad freelee ,NOT
if companies were to employ women only and pay less then how many of those women would get pregnant you would have to cover double the wage for a single job during maternity leave this didnt address pregnancy which i wish it did id appreciate some responses please thank you,NOT
congratulations best decision you will ever make dont get discouraged it ony gets easier with time ive been vegan for over a year thanks to freelee  ill never go back keep it up d,NOT
i dont have anything against transgenders but they should competi against other young men,ABU
as long as they compete with men and not women then theres no problem,ABU
there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap though but that is entierly up to the induvidual it is illegal to pay women or men less based on their sex so if someone is being paid less and can prove it is because she is a woman or because he is a man then take it to court and sue their asses,NOT
are you trans,NOT
gender is a social construct though,NOT
the community organizer field is  female which helps to explain obama,NOT
if there was a gender wage gap then employers would only hire women lmao,NOT
i used to believe that our future politicians will have to convince our people now i realize that they have the knowledge but are just purely evil and we must destroy it to rebuild our country because our opponents arent focused on bettering america they are hellbent on our demise,NOT
sending love from the vegan community    ,NOT
mens bone structures are different bone structure plays a big role in muscle development too i think its unfair to the other woman who put in work only to be outcompeted by these two im sorry we ve gone too far these two are very different from the other woman and someone needs to stop being a wuss and say it as it is,NOT
they look like milli vanilli from the s ,NOT
the only reason im not vegan and a pescetarian instead is becuz im growing im only ,NOT
two words divorce settlements,NOT
dont forget to eat animal products like our ancestors otherwise we will be all skinny weak vegans if we follow veganism my grandma is happy healthy strong because she doesnt eat plant based she doesnt worry or think what to eat she doesnt mind eating animal products be like grandma,NOT
 my highschool teach made me write a report on feminist i said i was a anti feminist because they complain about non existent problems like the wage gap  and i said one of the reasons women get paid less is because they dont work as much as men the women first laughed then i show this video then they just got pissed,NOT
i prefer to eat meat i am smarter than vegans,NOT
she is obviously trolling come on guys your attention is what her job is all about,NOT
no what will happen to your mukbangs,NOT
carb the fuck up love you,NOT
blimp pilot and lion tamer  wtf xd,NOT
omg i cried when you started talking about watching the slaughter videos i started tearing up i know what you mean,NOT
trish i think your view on who you think you might be is based on societys opinions the reasons you think you might be a male are based on straight masculine mens opinion on you as a girl thats the type you attract and as for you being attracted to gay men it could be an emotional thing you enjoy having sex with anyone not matter their orientation but you might feel like you identify with a gay man because thats who you are attracted too if you want a feminine boyfriend they do exist but the majority of men who are attracted to you seem to be masculine men so you feel thats what youre stuck with and as for being penis envy i am too girl i think most women can agree that if they had a penis they would be happier because being a cis male is easy and accepted they can be dominant and assertive and be considered manly and thats normal and bonus points if youre a white cis man because they get everything handed to them being drag looks fun and exciting and they play dress up and youre right they dont always wear a face full of make up but its their thing that they like to get all glam that doesnt necessarily mean you identify with them you just have the same hobbies i am woman love to put on cute pastel dresses mostly cuz i hate pants lol and wear make up but half the times i dont feel like taking the extra time to do all that,NOT
this explains the issue of gender roles and how it leads to career choices very pleased with how women have been gravitating toward jobs labeled as male jobs,NOT
what a joke of a world we live in  these men are sterling scholarships and awards thats young women have worked very hard for  get your shit together america,ABU
as a gay trans guy i can  say this is a shitshow and i pray to god its a joke,NOT
trish i really hope this isnt just a publicity stunt because a vegan diet and lifestlye will transform your life  i never in a million years thought you would see the light lol its going to be hard but it will be worth it ive got two of my best friends going vegan my mom is now vegetarian and my boyfriend is pescetarian good luck ,NOT
if you make someone suffer you will suffer too go vegan,NOT
wow good one,NOT
i wanna give you some advice dont pay attention to people trying to make you feel bad if you mess up plant based diet is awesome and im happy for you do the research yourself get interested yourself humans can survive off any food it all depends ont he quality and organic available in your location,NOT
to share truths bringing to light one of the darkest corners of humanity allows people to make decisions based on facts ritual animal abuse in the service of our taste buds and our refusal to acknowledge the verities of the industry is an atrocity akin to those who are caring out the act of processing animals for human consumption a vegan for two and a half years i am proud and privileged to be a part of the compassionate mindful vegan community this documentary helped me feel validated in my pursuit to make a difference for my health for my children for the planet andfor the animals,NOT

ok i have one for you can a man turn into a woman be a transgender then rape a girl then say its not rape because im a girl,NOT
the misconception about the wage gap is that it exists,ABU
coming from a trans man this isnt how it fucking works trish you need gender dysphoria to be trans gender dysphoria is feeling a disconnect and discomfort in your biological genders body and you clearly dont have that issue trans men can be gay yes trans men can like makeup and fashion yes but trans men absolutely do not want to be seen as a female thats against everything we stand for and have to go through this shit isnt a joke trish being trans isnt something you randomly use as an excuse for not liking straight men or for feeling insecure about being called a bitch because you are assertive you are one of the reasons people outside of the community see us as a joke i hope this is either a shitty joke that you somehow thought would be funny or that people realize this isnt how being ftm works,ABU
their not woman or man so they need another category for them and they should pay for it as they pay for the operation of sex change,ABU
i have the same opinions as you and i love to hear im not alone thanks so much for making me laugh and being amazing and real,NOT
i had a teacher in high school help explain this to me she had two children for both children she of course had to take time off of work and while her and her husband are both teachers with their doctorates in education when they retire he will end up having earned more money then her why is that because for each child she had to take roughly a year off work having her salary cut in half while her husband continued to work a big issue mentioned in this video is that women are still responsible for most of the household duties even with full time jobs ever hear of a father on paternity leave if the responsibilities were more equal maybe the pay gap would decrease yes in most jobs men and women will get paid the same amount of money if not there would be an even bigger uproar about this inequality its the longterm issues that the pay gap is about imagine having to try to divide or attention and priorities between work and your children evenly while your gender counterparts dont have this issuethey can automatically place their attention on work giving them a leg up in the workplace raising a child is a team effort and what kind of team mate leaves you with all the heavy lifting just to claim the gold medal not saying this is the case for every family but the statistics say its the case for a lot,NOT
these men should compete with other men so many actual women are having their athletic dreams taken away from them with this politically correct bullshit,ABU
yaaaaassssss get it queen ,NOT
maybe women choose different life choices because men and women are different on average not because of sexism which is what the wage gap mythargument implies maybe women want to parent and care for the household more than men in general and men want to got out into the world and bring home sustainance more than women in general why should anyone care about closing the wage gap when their is merely a difference in choices not a difference in opportunities infact women are currently given far more opportunities than men and women overall still choose differently than how wage gap apologists want them to,NOT
if these feminists want equality then why dont these feminists get mad about how women almost always win custody cases,NOT
if women want equality they can get slapped too,ABU
men are less privileged than women in the us they spend more time in prison for the same crime if charged with rape they will almost definitely be sent to jail guilty or not and if they arent they can be fired from their job for a false accusation if they are divorced they have a high chance of losing custody of children they are expected to do more dangerous jobs and risk their lives in things hardly any women would do in first world countries they are called sexist for just being male and are overall hated by feminazis,ABU

plz get educated girl this is gross if you were actually trans i would be supportive but this video is not what it means to be trans just because you like being around dudes doesnt mean youre trans youre mocking the trans community and fetishizing gay men this is very stereotypical and just over outward images its not what it means to be trans not wearing makeup doesnt make you trans being attracted to gay men isnt trans thats just a fetish admiring girls doesnt make you trans being glam doesnt make you trans youre not trans just because you think it would be easier to be a man youre not trans simply for feeling masculine also theythem has nothing to do with multiple personalities when using i in literature it can be used for one person when the gender is unknown so theythem can easily be used for someone who doesnt go by shehe its also offensive to say female energy comes with someone thats not it yes misogyny forces us to feel the need to dress up but not worrying ab that stuff does not mean youre a dude please do research get a therapist to talk through this because this hurts you clearly dont know what these things actually mean you need to think this through thoroughly and figure out what youre actually saying ill respect your pronouns but trust you need to get your head on right to know for sure what youre talking about hormones and surgical transitions are serious they arent just a little nose job you cant go back from them it is offensive you are confused you are not basically a drag queen first of all  drag is an art drag is not trans drag is not day to day life youre not a drag queen sweets learn these terms babes,NOT

i found it was easier to avoid fake meatscheese at first because they didnt taste authentic at first so i planned meals that didnt need meat or cheese like pasta or burritos and stuff like that,NOT
drop an f for the amount of people they have offended in this video,NOT
there were two persons both  they had exactly the same job the same education the guy got an amount of money and when the girl asked about his job he mentioned how much he earned she got a little less so if you take how much he earns and make it  dollar she earned like  cents so he got a little more money even though they had the same job same age and the same education,NOT
is it for real now ,NOT
there is a wage gap in between everyone the reason there is a gap is because everyone has different performances different shifts and different attendances you cant be making the exact same amount of money as your coworker if equal pay was actually a thing people that have bad performances are going to be paid as much as a person that has good performance would get and im not necessarily saying that women have worse performance than men one more thing i know a couple that worked in the same workplace different shifts but were the same hours and in the same department the lady makes about  more than her spouse and i guess its because he doesnt get things done sooooo yeah,NOT
please look at the doku dominion,NOT
hi im a vegetarian tofu is really good and simple to make and u can get tons of protein from it eat a lot of fruits and veggies they give you soooo much energy rice and beans are amazing too  black beans can give you so much protein too so i like to make black bean burritos beans cooking with cumin instead of meat u can add tofu too but yes goodluck babe eat lots of veggies and fruit honestly itll make u so energized,NOT

this is so amazing but trisha you set a goal that is most likely not going to happen and the worries me you said that after two weeks you are hoping to transform your whole body but that cant really happen in just two weeks please keep going after the two weeks and just wait your body will eventually look so great and you will feel great stay on this lifestyle and give it a year before you think to quit,NOT
its funny how a week ago she uploaded a super sexual video about how she likes to eat boys with her tits hanging out and then shes going to cry and say how she hates her female body and shes really a man ,NOT
im trans and not confused but you sure are sis,NOT
it isnt just the hours women retire earlier which is the time in your career you typically make the most money men typically are more willing to take dangerous jobs over safe ones which is why we see more men as ice road truckers and more women as nannies men typically are willing to take more risks move accross country for a better job pish harder to negotiate their salaries etc there is so much that goes into this looking at this statistic is just plain misleading,NOT
trishas a troll  if you didnt know that  youre dumb af,NOT

or just get your baby daddy to actually do some parenting,NOT
its pretty hard to believe in this wage gap when you arent affected by it i mean why would someone pay females less than males it makes no sense but my mother has experienced this wage gap and institutional sexism in the workplace when she found out by accident that her male counterparts who had been working the same job same hours same past experience were getting higher wages than her for no apperant reason call it a lone case or a sexist boss but this could be happening anywhere in front of your eyes oh and this happened in a country with probably the most gender equality in the world,NOT

relating more to men does not make you transgender being made fun of for being a girl with upper lip hair does not make you transgender thinking life would be easier with male genitalia does not make you transgender you can support the lgbt community without being a part of it you can dress and act masculine without being transgender you can have short hair without being transgender trisha this is extremely offensive to the transgender community,NOT

you forgot the variable that some women permanently or temporarily leave the workforce when having children big omission,NOT
you know what surprised me about this video that trisha never once mentioned how she wants to go vegan because she just wants to be healthy or for health reasons everything she mentioned had to do with  being thin  being skinny why cant you go vegan or vegetarian to just be healthy and fuel your body is healthy food i commend you for trying new things and trying to be vegan and healthy just dont make it about being skinny i know many vegans that arent skinny but they choose to fuel their body with healthy food,NOT

excellent video but its already to late to change planetary degradation the need to dismantle industrial civilization reduce human population simultaneously and remove the domineering cultures from the lands they have invaded is whats need but as i stated its to late industrial civilization has already effed up  the dominant cultures have proven themselves incapable of governing other peoples lands or countrys they have failed the world,NOT

no more cum then,NOT
ok im now  sure vox isnt a satire news organization,NOT
woman do get payed less but it depends on the country though i saw this video fully i have done research and i still think there is a wage gape but its not as bad as people think well at least in some countries,NOT

she posted it to get attention this was an old video,NOT
feminists would complain that the reason why women are only in  of the  fields that pays the best are because they are women,NOT
my biggest advice is dont freak out and give up if you find out something you ate had animal products its all about progress and doing the best you can just keep going forward if you feel like you want to indulge a little the gardein meat alternatives are amazing and the frappucinos at starbucks taste amazing with coconut milk you can still have all of your favorites  good luck,NOT

veggie stir frys with brown rice or rice noodles brown rice veggies sushi veggie burgers with salad or with wholewheat bread hummus oatmeal go to a health food store and look for low fat vegan products in packets to make it easy for you soup is another great one and baked potatoes good luck girl im rooting for you,NOT
men are paid more because they normally have to pay taxes and bills for their families but females are not really expected to pay taxes and bills men also are expected to work hard and longer but women are not expected to do so this also depends on how the genders have done based on quality and positive effects on their companies so overall i think men should be paid more,ABU
oh trish i am so so happy for you  thankfully theres a ton of amazing recipes online but also your friend freelee has great recipes too whole foods market always has vegan options of a lot of different foods i wish you the best trish and this video made me so so happy d let me know or others if you need any other help also try and stay away from fake meats and things like that and stick to real foods like all the veggies and fruits and quinoa and beans and rice an yeah  good luck love  ,NOT
women get paid less then men so why dont employers only employ women and save money or does it come down to skillsets,NOT
 its illegal to pay a woman less than a man for the exact same job and vice versa  a lot of the difference in pay between men and women overall can be attributed to personal choice in careers  there are underlying biological and evolutionary factors at play when it comes to which careers men and women choose  none of this is bad,NOT
youre guys  i dont care what you believe  morons taking advantage in womens sports because they sucked at male sports,ABU
shes trolling just to get clout and its sad imagine your channel dying so you have to say your trans pathetic,NOT
her voice is hard to listen to for very long,NOT
things i noticed you have a vocal growl that presents at the end of some sentences in a single word or end of a word usually multisyllabic words like instances grammar girl has one too for reference the word will drop in tone and be produced lower in the throat giving a little distortion to the word sounding like a growl lion tamer is now called lion trainer most crossword puzzle writers called constructors are men in prison with long sentences there are only about  that create all the puzzles books included you find my mother was an exception creating puzzles well into her s they become harder as the week progresses but not because the solutions are harder the clues become more obscure all crossword puzzles are diagonally symmetrical she was also a writer but changed her first name from julia to the initial j spelled jay because male writers were favored over female right out of the gate any major publisher can verify this she was also bostons first female insurance claims adjuster and fought the good fight to get that job many other male adjusters were livid they would even consider her she got her scuba certificate at  and pilots license at  while raising two boys on her own sorry to ramble but this seems to me relevant to the topic she found ways around the income gap renting rooms in our house typing for students and going back to school to get her masters in expressive psychotherapy at  the more ways across the gap the harder it will be to keep that gap open keep trying be creative and stay positive,NOT
it comes down to being happy yes being happy,NOT
it really pisses me off that people want to ignore the truth and still complain about something that doesnt exist,NOT
i like trisha paytas now,NOT
i actually think this is a fair argument at least more than the black and white yes it does exist or no it doesnt exist arguments i think what it boils down to is that a lot of businesses have not evolved to st century standards there was a simpler time when most people got up around the same time worked roughly around the same time and went to bed around the same time that isnt true anymore so a lot of business structures need to change which is a far better solution than simply giving certain people more money especially if they do less work,NOT
 its a fact that a wage gap exists have they done any research on the supposed wage gap that had been disproven you could say  ah its all men that have disproven it ahhhhhh oppression well one of the first people to disprove this wage gap was a woman reply with your thoughts on this bullshit,NOT

i love animals i have kept many animals as pets during my life dogs cats canaries parrots fish everything you can think of but going vegan is also killing animals indirectly what do you think will happen to the domestic animal breeds such as sheep cows chicken and to a lesser extent pigs and goats i am not judging you or saying that you are wrong for not eating meat its your choice i am just stating facts the current way of keeping domestic animals is cruel and it should be changed but eliminating meat from the diet of people is not the answer people dont eat dogs yet dogs suffer much more than farm animals to see what i am talking about i will give you an example i am mostly a catch and release fisherman but also i keep some fish you might say its cruel but i am contributing for the fish population much more than you who arent fishing or eating fish i pay a daily fee which is not cheap to fishthe law is that most of that money goes to fish stocking which means that thousands of fish are bred and released every year because of me and people like me so who is the real contributor to the wild waters here me or you  fish that is the daily limit on trout fishing are humanely killed to feed me and hundreds are released due to me,NOT
i dont like to be the center of attention proceeds to try to be the center of attention,NOT

so basically the wage gape hasnt anything to do with sexism why cant you put out an additional video informing people that its not mens fault  stop as people at the bbc are doing trying to circumnavigate mens earnings to women who earn less,NOT
everyone that says oh if women are cheaper then why wont i hire a full women staff yall are the dumbest kids online if you watched the video you would learn that due to hours needed by a women in her s it would be seen as unprofitable for you to hire all female staff thats how american business calculates it between the potential maternity paid leave and hours a female employee might try to take of american business dont want female employees typically did you not pay attention to the whole video and i say american business because apparently we are the only country in the world that doesnt have by law paid maternity leave,NOT

this is the one and only thing prager u has ever gotten right in terms of being factual i will give them credit for this thing they have not been either lying through their teeth about or misrepresenting facts to support good on you for actually having a legitimate argument for once ever but i immediately retract my praises when i realize the only reason they dont lie about this subject is because it fits their narrative and position without need for modification therefore there is no need to go through intense mental gymnastics to make the position fit their views like almost every other single goddamned subject they bring up but here is a newsflash people on the left already know this fact the only ones who still believe in it are new wave feminists and overly extreme leftists you are late to the party trying to debunk a situation that has already been apparent for quite some time now to anyone who isnt insane or stupid,NOT
watch and follow fit nika,NOT
i am so freaking happy for you hope you fall in love with it,NOT
here and now i draw a line  i wont watch anything with greta anymore,NOT
another thing is men are more likely to ask for raises or promotions than women so even if the man and the woman are doing the exact same work with the exact same hours and are both deserving of a raise a smart employer isnt going to just hand it out unless they ask for a wage or risk losing a valued employee,NOT
that like to dislike ratio proves that quite some salty feminists watched this,NOT
i found my new favorite video on internet,NOT

vox is horrible youre not smart vox just get to the point dont try to beat around the bush of the fact that theres no wage gap,NOT
sorry but i think you just are jealous of how males are in society like you are jealous that men can be assertive and not be a bitch you are jealous that you dont need makeup or hair done and it not be frowned upon you dont want to be hit on by weird guys like most people dont want that this doesnt mean you are trans you just like the idea of being a guy cus they are treated better in society idk but i think thats how ur felling,NOT
go compete against men  u sick people,ABU

o brasil agradece pela traduo para o nosso idioma,NOT
i think shes having an identity crisis because of all the drama going on,NOT
its a yikes from me,NOT
what influences those choices made why do women not choose to go into those top  earning professions if you say its because they arent capable that makes you sexist if you say its because women are reinforced that they are less capable than men from as young as  years old which means they grow up to make those choices then you agree with science,NOT
eating meat isnt necessarily the problem as far as animal cruelty is concerned its factory farming if you are going to eat meat check the source and do the research,NOT
its almost like you cant have everything you want just because you want it and there are consequences for your life choices weird,NOT
this is so ridiculous i cant understand your mindset in constantly doing stupid things for publicity get over yourself for real,ABU
ive fallen for gay men plenty of times but that doesnt mean im trans it just means my gaydar has been out of order for years xd,NOT

just fruit hmm you need rice potatoes beansveggies at all you should check out some vegan restaurants in your area and do videos,NOT
i love all the sexists clearly not even watching the video the article and video both go into detail that the issue is a matter of inflexibility and increasingly outdated business practices rather than overt sexism this isnt the raving of some tumblrite for gods sake,NOT

this isnt enough proof to say that there isnt a wage gapbut there also isnt proof to say there is a wage gap between genders there are also other factors like the proportion of boy and girls a college accepts this isnt always   on both sides either at this point both sides are dumb,NOT
when the one girl mentioned that she was looking at social media comments about her the reporter said some of those comments were harsh like saying terry and andrea had an unfair advantage because they were boys thats not a harsh comment at all thats just someone stating the facts theres a reason they have separate sporting events for men and women theres a reason they have the womens record and the mens record in track and field one of the trans girls mothers commented during her interview it allows her to be who she wants to be and that has more weight than winning a medal not to the girls competing against her who are trying to get college scholarships its great that she has loving supportive parents but i hope people realize this is a complicated issueand being against them competing in state finals has nothing to do with being anti transgender,NOT
every rd wave feminist called out hollyyy heck,NOT

even though many things in this video are correct we shouldnt forget that the main driving factor in wage gap today is having kids women without kids in the first world countries earn the same as men women with  very much not the same goes for men if they are the primary care taker but due to traditional gender roles this is rare this is what the gender gap is primarily about,NOT
bravo thank you for sharing this film,NOT

my mother is a personal trainer she makes around minimum wage my father is a plant manager he pays for just about everything my mother chose to switch from the factory work my dad stayed in after having my sister she wanted a more flexible schedule so she could be able to take care of us she went and got her dream job dad is usually on call can work up to  hours on a bad day and  on a good one he has been at the same place for almost  years if he could he would get an easier lower paying job but he cant afford to my fiancee is a mechanic he makes  an hour unlicensed when he writes his test it could jump to    when we have kids he could be close to hr i am going into medical office administration while it can eventually pay in the s i will never earn as much as him unless i end up being promoted or get extra schooling i am at a disadvantage though when kids happen we both want me to be stay at home until the last kid is in school so thats a lot of years of advancement i lose this is my choice in the end no matter what a woman who wants a family will end up sacrificing more time even if just to birth and recover what we need to do is encourage women to try trades and high academic pursuit shared maternity leave or father maternity leave fathers as stay at homes seriously if you could afford it who wouldnt love time off or even when you are staying home and on leave taking classes related to your field to keep your knowledge current i believe that if we want to we can close the tiny gap left and all be happy,NOT

trisha i am literally sooooo proud of you holly crap and if you watch freelees what i eat in a day she is a super huge help when i went vegan i would just look up vegan recipe videos they help too,NOT

daiyas mozzarella cheese is amazing its so delicious i put it on everything lol silk yogurt is so good chocolate almond milk is delicious as well gardien makes a bunch of amazing vegan meals theyd be in the frozen section try not to take stuff out of your diet but replace them with vegan alternatives for example dont just cut out milk replace it with almond milk cashew milk soy milk hemp milk rice milk banana milk etc say you eat pizza every weekend or something replace it with vegan pizza if you dont want to make a vegan pizza i know daiya has a really awesome vegan pizza or if you like smores you can still have smores just use vegan marshmallows and vegan chocolate not all dark chocolate is vegan or if you eat tacos every tuesday just replace the meat with tofu or beyond beef frozen meat ive been vegan for  months and ive lost so much weight i literally eat whatever i want and how much i want im never hungry i really hope you do well on a vegan diet and that it sticks its seriously amazing so proud of you for giving it a chance ,NOT
wow leean god complex much,NOT
trisha and her statement should be added to the definition of transtrender in every dictionary out there,NOT
oh man is this because of the threesome she had with adam and lena,NOT
yes there is a gender wage gap but its simply because men choose different types of careers women generally choose lesser paying jobs its that simple also men usually work longer or take fewer vacations,NOT
dont forget to use make up which hasnt been tested on animals ,NOT
instead of solely focusing on making jobs more flexible why not adress the real issue get men to do  of work of raising their children they are not doing equal parental leave feeding bathing children taking them to doctors appointments etc,NOT
women are smaller weaker and dumber and therefor should on average be paid less,ABU
are there any videos responding to this with counter info,NOT
what are their motives for perpetuating the myth,NOT
hahaha feminists can shut up now or should i say radical feminists,NOT
see how nice other people are she complimented you and you made a video of making fun of her while eating chicken,NOT
they also miss that in the military men perform more work for equal pay work equals amount of pushups and setups performed and run times on pt test in this example specifically,NOT
trish u ate sour cream and onion chips last night those are not vegan,NOT
this was almost a good video almost the points were good but you cant keep saying wage gap when you are so clearly explaining an earnings gap,NOT
first week of veganall is well,NOT
i feel like you have missed a critical point to the wage gap fallacy this is the fact that if you simply aggregate all of the data for full time mens and womens salaries then you are not taking into account that certain careers pay less than others and there are disproportionate amounts of certain genders working in certain fields for example lets take teaching and compare that to construction work women are the overwhelming majority of teachers in most countries still to this day and yet teaching in most countries is considered a low pay job on the other hand construction work pays very well in most first world countries and is dominated by males you can make many other comparisons such as nurses vs doctors or retail service assistants vs research scientists and you will come up with similar results now the important question is why less women are choosing the higher paying career paths to this there is not a clear answer but studies suggest that women prefer jobs that involve more social interaction there are other factors such as strict fitness requirements for certain high paying labourintensive jobs like construction however it is intellectually dishonest to ignore these facts just because we dont completely understand the underlying reasons behind them we need to be focusing on how to get more male teachers and female construction workers if you really want to close this gap but im not so sure thats even the right approach if women want to work in a field that pays less then why should we tell them they cant what about freedom for women to choose their career and is it wrong that teaching should pay less than research science these are far more tricky to answer and no one seems to want to address these questions at all on this channel,NOT
this is totally unfair and unnecessary why is this even a debate they are boys period they should run with boys not girls their parents are sick as well come on no one hates transgenders but biologically this is wrong what is wrong with this world,ABU
the caramel latte from starbucks is my go to i just make sure that its done with soy milk and it tastes so good it tastes so much better than actual milk from cows,NOT
you straight up say the shit people dont wanna hear youre  real with your views and opinions and arent afraid to stand behind them regardless of who may be offended we need people like you to keep it real too many people these days get so offended and read way too deep into everything love watching your videos,NOT
because if businesses only hired women men would sue,NOT
no one said you are not a woman or people doesnt see you as who you are we except transgender but you can not lie about the biological facts of your natural born body we see you as a woman but it is also a fact that you were born with more and stronger muscles ect and that fact you cant ignore especially not when it comes to sports be fair you can not take your transsexuality as an excuse for everything,ABU
shes still eating chicken fingers like everyday on snapchat,NOT
if anything she could have said she is nonbinary but ok,NOT
honestly i hate all meat but im addicted to dairy ,NOT
this be a fucking story these are guys omg wtf,ABU
feminist why cant i earn six figures with my masters in womens studies damn patriarchy realists why would i waste so much time and money on a womens studies degree,NOT
there will never be a girl transgender beat all the boys male in a weightlifting competition period,NOT
she looks like syd the sloth but on heroin,ABU
i love trish and good for her but come on it is clear she made this vid a while ago good for trish but good for her for helping you out we all know she only posted this vid to help your ego to help you out because of how your reputation is failing trish is too nice and hell i even believe you paid her to do this for you money money money is all you want and we all know how fake you are freelee lets see how long it take for this comment to be deleted ,ABU
funny how woman want to claim to be mens equal in every way until it comes down to the wire and they actually come up against men in a contest then its all oh we are ladies we cant be competing against men thats unfair,NOT
you should buy a lot of pasta potatoes and other good carbs d there are a lot of vegan meat substitutes that are really good like burgers and tofu and a lot of other stuff theres basically vegan options for like everything d,NOT
what about the death on the job gap  men,NOT
omg yes i was waiting for this i love you freelee you never disappoint ,NOT
it took me about a month to completely cut out meat it takes a while especially when you are a extreme meat eater like how i was before so i think she is taking it slowly and just support her  dont hate,NOT
things like avocados seeds coconut oil and tofu will keep you going for a long time,NOT
its unfair you are still a boy,ABU
thats why its always necessary to hear both sides of the arguments,NOT
we had feminism to give women choice we have feminism again because most women didnt choose to go into stem jobs,NOT
i pray for them  its no debate they are male and have been allowed to embrace a homosexual mindset im not speaking in hate but love its a tradgedy they will never have wives and children naturally and go against gods will in the process  the father said is it fair  no but life isnt fair we all face struggles but a male is male period i meen its not about equality but the reality of the sport,ABU
love the people who invoke god to justify their eating of animals yeah im sure your god would be stoked to learn were artificially mass producing animals even though we dont have to and destroying the planet at the same time the planet that ya know he created at least in the minds of these religious zealots,NOT
childbirth there you go,NOT
and by just using your supposed common sense that you claim in this video to justify the gap then you are just judging a saw man and a needle woman in their ability to cut wood,NOT
i am so fucking proud of you you are doing such a good thing eat lots of greens and get your fruit in and carb the fuck upmany vegans say that haha,NOT
for me personally i love starches more than sweets many vegans thrive on a fruity diet but for myself personally i enjoyed reading the starch solution by doctor mcdougall it resonates with me more just try multiple things as long as you are eating mostly whole foods you will feel better and be healthier make sure you are eating enough many people arent used to eating so much but vegan whole foods arent very calorie dense so you need to eat more and throughout the day eat lots of veggies and fruits potatoes are your friends  most vegans tend to eat high carb low fat good luck and persevere,NOT
no one liked that,NOT
thank you lol,NOT
someone please link this on every fb feminazi page,ABU
the wage gap doesnt exist though,NOT
channels you should have a look at now for easy meals are high carb hannah nina and randa hot for food and laurentoyotas personal channel the last one are more cooking channels and not necessarily easy to recreate especially if youre only starting out but they show you how incredibly easy the whole lifestyle is,NOT
while i understand that they feel like women and have started hormone therapy i still dont thing its fair biologically born females have virtually no chance against biologically born males the fact still remains that they are of they are biologically male and its not fair,ABU
imagine being a woman boxer and seeing a trans mike tyson ready to whoop ya ass,NOT
i have a feeling that the next generation in the us will have women being the breadwinners if it is true that college degrees will average better paying jobs women will outpace men women are enrolling and graduating college more than men this number keeps increasing as women start to assert their professional power onto the job market starting a family will go by the wayside i am certain that as this happens the population will start to significantly decrease in the upper middle class this has already started to happen in japan,NOT
a wage gap video that takes variables into account,NOT
wait people still believe in the wage gap come on this is the most basic issue there is and people believe it,NOT
question  is it true that in study after study when identical resumes are submitted for open jobs the resumes with male names at the top get far more callbacks ,NOT
keep dreaming especially when considering the difference in iq between the sexes,NOT
pathetic cheats cant compete against men because there crap,ABU
this is an amazing video thank you so much,NOT
this outfit and hair was from like  weeks ago when you went to that premiere and you werent vegan this past two weeks,NOT
so its like the female straight version of james charles basically like how he likes straight guys,NOT
yass trish this is awesome,NOT
im soooo fuckgn happy,NOT
if shes going full vegan she knows she cant use any products that are tested on animals or use anything thats leather,NOT
if you compare men and women in the same jobs men unequally earn promotions and make on average  more this video misses the point because even when you compare men and women with the same jobs education levels and backgrounds women make less regardless on the occupation choices of women as a whole,NOT
that intro voice tho,NOT
great video with a solid explanation,NOT
im a cis woman and i think trisha is being ridiculous she says shes a trans man and then in the next video shes sitting there in her bra wtf,NOT
lol freelee is gonna be like taking credit for this ,NOT
its not a pay gap its an earning gap,NOT

the first female antifeminist,NOT
just saying because u probs dont know but mcdonalds fries arent vegan and make sure to eat lots of leafy greens for protein you can get omega  from flax seeds and you should supplement b because you cant really get that anywhere on a vegan diet the best breakfast would be lots of fruits or a smoothie watch bonny rebbeca raw alignment or fully raw kristina to get the hang of things and see how to eat proprely,NOT
were affecting the ignorant,NOT
blaire the amount of patience you have to actually watch trishas video longer then a minute youre so brave,NOT
it should be equal wages,NOT
australias money interest in animal products cows in particular is so obvious its mind boggling theyve confused the public through media from what is actually going on to a shameful degree what really stood out was around the time of the nation wide vegan protesting this year most people i spoke to didnt really know why they were protesting and why they took some animals they literally thought it was some random petty overly emotional people just trying to make problems no clue of the reality of the situation plantbased vegan is definitely moving forward as the new generation has access to more information and conversation,NOT
she said  hair lip ,NOT
there all sick ,ABU
very well done,NOT
almost sure she thinks being gay and being a lesbian are different things ,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap the fact it doesnt exist  women have better chances of getting higher paying jobs than men,ABU

oh gosh vegan mukbang nowlol,NOT
veggie pasta is great also not consuming dairy had made my acne go away almost completely,NOT
one of my favorite points in debunking this myth is the one which states if women really are payed so much less than men then why would anyone ever hire a man spending  to  less on salaries would only be good business,NOT
mcdonalds is going to regret being so late to the changing diet  was a big year of change for me im not vegan but i do eat  plants when im not around friends or family ive been trying to do plantbased for about  months with varying degrees of success i had a few bad weeks and even a couple months where i just ate garbage so my progress has been very slow however i still feel so much better than before i started ive lost  pounds so far im seriously at my high school weight im still overweight but goodness i never thought it was possible this year im going to be stricter with my friends and family ive been making such excellent progress and i dont want to lose it because of them i know they love me and all but they try to sabotage me at every opportunity despite knowing im trying to get healthy i wasnt at all interested in fast food fake meats until recently i finally realized that fake meats have one advantage over real meat  lack of hormones no one eats fast food for health but if my friends are going to take me to these places anyway then i can at least get the healthiest option i havent been to kfc for years but i actually want to go just so i can try their vegan sandwich i obviously wont do that all the time since its still very fattening but id like to try it once,NOT
they did them little white girls dirty,ABU
bruh she on meth,ABU
i have no beef with transgender people but there is a reason why men and women are separated in sports in the first place mens bodies are different from womens period a transgender woman does not have the body of a biological woman and that is just the biology behind it either they should compete with biological men or better yet they should make a separate competition only between transgender people,ABU

how about we make it more culturally accepted even expected for men to do just as much in the home and when it comes to taken care of kids i dunno seems that would be most fair,NOT
brilliant documentary just woshed ore animal eaters watch this,NOT
if men make more money than women then why dont businesses just hire all women because thats not how ceos negotiate payat all how little a boss pays their employees is based on what they can get away with while negotiating wages there is a reason why employees are discouraged from discussing their salaries with one another its to keep pay negotiations in favor of the boss and in a hypothetical environment such as an office building with more men in it than women you can get away with paying women a lower salary by making it difficult to compare her earnings with other employees,NOT
trish why you lying to us ,NOT
such bs michael could have ended that debate easy imagine he went transgender and competed with woman no hormone therapy will undo the advantages of his training as a male athletei mean come on muscle memory never leaves did these two guys compete in mens track before transitioningthis is what i want to know,ABU

the wage gap isnt real women in general are less willing to go for higher paying jobs compared to men,NOT
watch what i eat in a day videos drink alot of water babe eat grains rice beans pasta,NOT
lets send lebron to the wnba and see what happens,NOT
i mostly agree with this video although i think there are some things one still has to consider as you mentioned there still is a wage gap between men and women for the same work which you explained as being the cause of men being more willing to do long hours but why is that biological differences between men and women arent that big so that they would allow us to say that the reason is biological no its the way how men and women are raised differently in our society thats also the reason why most women work in lower paid jobs as you mentioned at the beginning because we raise them to work in these jobs thats the core of the whole gender wage gap discussion,NOT
your conclusions do for logically follow from your argument that there is a wage gap,NOT
please trisha please do not just eat fruit do not listen to this vegan freelee pseudo science you should eat a normal vegan diet meaning anything you want i recommend eating vegan junk food to start off bc it is literally soooooo good and wayyyy healthier than animal product junk food there are so so many vegan options you can eat not just fruit and vegetables please trish do not just start eating only fruit and do not eat how freelee eats its been proven by science numerous times that if you eat more calories than you burn you will gain weight eat high carb plant foods rice lentils oats pasta etc til you are satiated not stuffed to the point of vomiting the way freelee eats works for her but it has been proven to not work for everyone some great vegan channels to watch are unnatural vegan the vegan cheetah his channel will be back up soon i hope the vegan lass high carb hannah sorry for the caps but i am so proud of you trish for doing this and i just dont want you to do some shit pseudo science restrictive fruit diet bc of freelee,NOT
women earn less cuz they work less hours then men or they dont work dangerous job that can get them killed,NOT

female supremacy and taking over men position jobs have become an issue democrats and liberals should be ashamed,NOT
i think she is confusing bisexuality with being transgender,NOT
 is not  less than  at most its  of ,NOT
kayla itsines ad was before this video ,NOT
imagine your gender being so fragile you need to compete against women or else youll feel invalid men have advantages in sports thats why theyre segregated,ABU
we just need to make men take on lower paying jobs and women take on higher paying jobs so then we can all be the same and collectively earn the same amount because otherwise its sexism  vox,NOT
its so frustrating bc everything described is like pinnacle nonbinary but then theres the shit talking of nonbinary pronouns and im just so tired,NOT
to everyone trying to expose her because her last video has a leather purse this was shot before her music video meaning she only did it to lose weight she recorded this video like last month obviously it did not work out in my opinion it was because she did it for the wrong reasons,NOT
i thought jfk passed an equal pay bill,NOT
pappa bless this,NOT
i love how shes talking about being transgender and eating chickfila at the same time,NOT
im confused ,NOT
i think shes just genderfluid is what shes trying to say shes obviously confused so instead of hating on her maybe comment tips for her  she needs it lol,NOT
what people who discuss this issue never take into account is the fact that men are generally more aggressive and take higher risks when it comes to finding employment they also are more likely to hold out for higher pay instead of taking a job sooner this vid also doesnt mention the fact that though women in dual income households take more and better care of the children men generally do more of the household manual labor repairs maintenance additions etc yet another incomplete and misleading view of pay gap between genders,NOT
thanks for this video i am at awe with the fact that i have met people who genuinely believe that the wage gap exists,NOT
dont be scared of carbs i know you wanna lose weight and everything we are told about losing weight is about cutting carbs but you gotta carb the fuck up girl eat loads and loads,NOT
notice how she didnt bring up women having children or wanting a home life once not once solid points,NOT
love the meat love the vegetableno can do,NOT
this is a good video it takes into account that men are able to give more to a job because they traditionally have less responsibilities and indicates that women in the position to do the same equal close to the same amount a statistic glossed over quite often i have one contention however the video states that the concept of the wage gap is based on the difference in median income yet what most people actually say and believe is the following women make  cents on the dollar a man makes for the same job which is very different statement that indicates intentional oppression by employers,NOT
shes probably just trying to wind people up for clout,NOT
there is wage gap because men is doing better not because of discrimination for same job experience and hours of work women gets payed same as men,NOT
i love you so much freelee you are so inspiring and im going to go vegan because of you thankyou so much,NOT
lol someone needed views deserately ,NOT
first off tricia you are beautiful no matter who is standing next to you or what the number of the scale says as far as food goes no need to worry about protein all plant foods contain adequate amount of amino acids and as long as you eat a variety of plants you will meet your protein needs worrier any problem the most important thing to remember is to limit as much fat as you can and load up on carbohydrates youll have to get over your fear of carbs such as pasta breads and potatoes and rice  and of course fruit too but that wont be enough calories for you longterm make your food tasty maybe look up some delicious recipes such as curry stir fry or go on youtube or on freelees channel also i would highly recommend going to vegan restaurants so you can still enjoy delicious food and not feel deprived,NOT
such a great movie thanks ,NOT
shared on my fb page the films get better and better every year the energy is changing and it shows in their films you can feel the triumph  the year of the vegan  we liberate mother earth,NOT
women are not available to work for long hours and with a flexible schedule because they are obligated to their family responsibilities and for which they dont get paid obviously while men are obligated only for a financial responsibility towards the family even in cases where either of them earn almost the same womens inability to work in places where there is potential danger and where physical strength is required is highly related to their body makeup and what nature has given them it is foolish to demand biologically more from a the other half of the human population instead work must be alloted according to the universal societal obligations of both the sexes and most importantly their biological limit on an average common sense isnt enough to justify a problem of this magnitude,NOT
are you nippling me fucking finally,NOT
running faster is not a choice these young people are not biologically anything other than males social preference are something different,ABU
i went cold turkey vegan on the th the first day it was fine but for the next  days i had really bad headaches and it felt like someone was stirring my brain with a fork i made sure i was getting stuff like protein and calcium  i thought i was just becoming immune i was like does this happen to every vegan at the start i havent had any headaches for  days now but does anyone know why that happened,NOT
trish i love your eyelashes which ones are they ,NOT
im trans ftm and this isnt right,NOT
same old argument same old bs same old arrogant person trying to push the fact that there is a gender pay gap which there isnt men get payed more because of the variables if u hired a woman and a man for the exact same job they would get payed the same but men usually work longer later and are less likely to take vacation time,NOT
the reason why women do not choose to work more is because they mostly take care of their children this difference comes from unfair distribution of housechores and child care between wife and husband,NOT
the wage gap does not exist,NOT
gigi is right though,NOT
the gender wage gap is foolish you get paid for what you do just because you are a female doesnt mean you can do easy jobs and expect a high wage most of the people who take risk and toil hard are men as i know most of the women get promoted easily regardless of how they work i have seen males work so hard fighting hard to get promoted but this woman deserves greater credit,NOT
ok take testosterone and cut your tits off get dysphoria lmao fuck off,ABU
nobody trisha ive always liked gay men so im a gay man bruh,NOT
yeplooking like its time to be an expat let them create a seperate division and compete against other trans just like the special olympicspoor little tinktink whatup katsee you in costa rica bruthajudgement days coming ahead of schedule,ABU
where are the outraged feminists when you need them,NOT
i love science and logic over social stupidity thank you thank you so much,NOT
im  and first went vegan in  its amazing to see the progression of veganism between each year and the increased awareness,NOT
amazing  more and more awareness and opening,NOT
i didnt realize sam smith was nonbinary i know nonbinary seems like a new thing to a lot of people but i assure you the only thing new about it is having a term for it my entire life ive been a nongendered person personally i feel like there are a lot of people coming out because its trendy but imo if even  of those people are legitimately trans and more comfortable coming out about it now im okay with it so long as its not young people who can take things too far and permanently change their bodies in ways they cant change back if they change their mind i think medical intervention should only be for adults i have mixed feelings about hormone blockers for trans kids and i dont know enough about it to have a solid opinion,NOT
 load of bullshit excuses,NOT
 k  k bitchy feminist woman that have no husband to complain to because they so bitchy,ABU
yes change is happening,NOT
i wish they would title these documentaries differently because so many people wont even take a look if it has the word vegan in it,NOT
omfg when trish says egg and i remember i have had eggs boiling on the stove for over half an hour ,NOT
that lack of intersectionality though,NOT
you can ask starbucks to sub coconut or soy milk into anything so you can still order your fav drinks ,NOT
and although that statement is factually true cite your sources honey,NOT
if your trying to loose weight being vegan is not going to help going to the gym  hours per week thats is loosing weight vegan is not going to help you at all sorry thats is from experience i tried vegan when i was  and it did not help at all you will feel drained inside so i decided to go to the gym houra a week going on a year now and i lost  pounds now im  and i feel great,NOT
this was a pretty good video tbh im still skeptic on both sides but this was well presented though i wish your sources were there also it does seem dodgy that theres still a  gap obviously most of this can probably be explained but i worry for the poor souls whore paid less purely for things like agegenderrace etc,NOT
few videos before  i love pig  i love eggs omg chicken is muh life butim glad ure putting effort into this trish,NOT
jizz is high on proteins,NOT
this has now become an annual ritual for me watching the vegan documentary in december every year  keep up the good work pbn and all the vegans,NOT
to earn a living you must be of value to get a job you must qualify for what theyre paying you simple as that women have different priorities than men the label feminist is so overrated and even exploited by politicians and businesses when really its just grown women throwing tantrums in a glorified way im probably going to be attacked if i say this i dont care about feminism focus on your mind your intelligence not just the fact that you have a vagina,ABU
what gets me is how much work these evil companies have put into hiding this heinous crime they commit i think if everyone knew all the graphic details of what factory farms do most would at least cut back animal consumption thats why these companies go out of their way to make sure we cant find this information easily im one of the most curious people you will ever meet i have spent time researching almost everything including looking up sillyrandom topics like the history of watermelon but these companies go so far out of their way to hide this evil that even someone like me never stumbled up to this topic by myself my sister mentioned it to me a year ago and thats when i researched and learned about this horror even as a lifelong meat eater who loves meat and comes from a meat based culture i couldnt morally continue to partake in this evil i have been vegan since and will never touch meat again im very old school and grew up with the idea that men never cry or show emotions im basically the stereotypical tough guy who almost never shows emotions but ever since i learned about this evil act every once in a while it comes into my head and all i want to do curl up into a ball and weep for the poor defenseless animals that we torture so mercilessly we have to invent a new word for what we do to these poor animals because even the word evil doesnt cut it,NOT
vegans have to be consistent with the ethical goals they try to push on other people if you want ethical goals support local businesses and banks and dont buy from big name brands like nike,NOT
nuts beans tofu tempeh,NOT
a womans work is never done and that explains the wage gap,NOT
the wage gap exists but not due to sexism women work less hours choose less demanding jobs and are less aggressive in negotiating salaries,NOT
yay trisha im so so happy,NOT
im a female i was born female no makeup my hair is never done i wear male clothing i am  months pregnant and just wanna be comfortable    i dont look like a girl but hey i am fine with that not gonna say something im not just for views im bisexual idc what you are ill be there for anyone but idk if anyone should have to believe this,NOT

this is great good luck hun,NOT
when will you animal based eating people wake up and wise up you are killing yourselves and others by supporting those companies that process animal products for food we need more plant based eating options now right now,ABU
terry miller competed this year as a boy in indoor was trash then competed as a girl outdoor and broke the state open record for the m,NOT
wnba is gonna be lit in a few years,NOT
video summary a lack of flexibility can cause a wage gap in certain roles why this is bullshit blame men for working under shittier conditions than most women so that their families wont have to work as much then call it unfair to the women ha welcome to  everybody edit oops actually  even better,NOT
i buy my foods from grocery stores support your small grocery store no meat in site supermarkets will take your money and buy meat produce thus giving you a guilty conscience your money is now blood money feel ashamed or start buying from grocery stores or online vegan produce only,NOT

being vegan has literally positively changed my life its really great  you can eat as much as you want but still lose weight its witchcraft  you always feel good because you know that you arent harming animals  your skin begins glowing and looks much smoother and healthier i hope that you enjoy the experience but you dont have to eat just fruit eat lots of carbs,NOT

trisha gets breast implants lip fillers a bunch of cosmetic surgery also trisha im a trans man,NOT
notice how the lowest paying vocations are all caring professions  which are all stereotypically womens work if there was no gender pay gap the lowest paid jobs would be brought in line with the highest paying jobs but unfortunately womens work is not valued and therefore not paid well men have more freedom in their choices to relocate and work long hours because it is traditionally the woman who takes care of the other responsibilities so that he may provide for the family unless of course he has none of those extra family related responsibilities caring for ageing parents children cooking cleaning other stereotypical womens work this video literally goes on to say that people without responsibilities who can be at the business beck and call will be favoured because it suits the business and who in society has the least responsibility to caring men traditionally theyre job is to provide and protect which in this era translates to bring in the money this video is a contradiction of itself,NOT
it doesnt exist,NOT
im pretty straight have been for the entirety of my life but if george michael would have suddenly become straight id have been the first bitch to fly to the uk to find him lol that does not nor will it ever mean i was supposed to be a man,NOT

i love this video i just wish the comment section could be as objective and intelligent than just toxic and hateful you can consume knowledge and understand those who you strongly disagree with without completely becoming assholes but assholes love to live in comment sections cause theyre unable to do anything really to help make things better other than yell insults and raise their own stress levels and overall make the internet an assholish place,NOT
kinda makes you wonder if kobe couldve made it in the wnba,NOT

ive been vegan for  months and ive been so happy ,NOT
the extinction rebellion chapter in austin tx doesnt avidly support veganism unfortunately,NOT
and now find a sledgehammer large enough to pound that piece of logic into a feminist stupid head good luck ,ABU
convoluted logic untested then becomes fantasy and distortion you state that there is no gender wage gap and then state that the gap is small then you justify the wage gap we can argue about how small and justifiable the gap is but first we need to know how you can state something that just isnt true in the first place this is just the old evangelical trick of providing lie to people who dont want to be called liars,NOT
the fact that a woman is explaining in this video proves this show no gender bias,NOT
blair honey i love you but trisha is one of youtubes biggest troll and youve been whooshed,NOT
the amount of shade that the beginning of the video has is killing me ,NOT
i beleive in you trisha ,NOT
thanks sarah very informative,NOT
is there any vegan in here,NOT
when you say youre going to do something out loud to people you are actually less likely to complete it also wasnt this video filmed a while ago stop trolling girl,NOT
and they think we want to eat round shaped squishy veggies that stink like death so beyond dumb its impossible to keep them out of our wallet stay in the garden,NOT
this video while has some correct information is presented and framed in a way to show the side of the argument that affirms that the wage gap is not real there are similar videos put out by other organizations that have the same format they present facts in a way that supports there argument and leaving out those that dont while that wage gap is not as big as some groups claim it is larger than this video claims the topic is very complex and there is no definitive answer because the every situation is different so to say its a us versus them argument is just letting a very complex situation fall pray to party politics,NOT
aww hate revamp couple of those were reusing old videos  like those fat piece of sht eating in restaurant confused stick old habbits this image is so fkin horifyingly traumatizingly disgusting to see fat people are the perfect symbol for climate change carelessness disrespect hate torture slavery murder rape violence anger that or the symbol of the cow no offence to the herbivorous digesting methane burbing creatures being bred in an insane amounth no trees no grass no predators to balance them out just like human no one to eat us up or restain the amount of babies,ABU
i am a woman and identify as such but i rarely do make up unless i have to and love to play sports what was being called a tom boy when i was younger seems to now prompt society to corner you as trans now wtf,NOT
two things that the world need to change  fossil fuel transition to renewable  transition to plant based meat,NOT
i think we should all keep in mind that its also more difficult for women to get into higher paid jobs than it is for men not necessarily for lack of willingness though fewer women seek out certain jobs than men but from labour work to highpaid management positions males are more likely to be chosen by employers out of an equal pool of prospective employees and even sometimes when a woman has greater qualifications its a similar problem to how fewer africanamericans gain employment even when race ratio and education is equal across candidates i dont know if its just something society will grow out of or if something needs to be done to break the cycle of unequal opportunityunequal selection here in australia its not too bad given that state education is easily accessible and puts most kids on equal footing as far as modern education goes but still countless indigenous families cant get their kids the same opportunities because its so much harder for them to get a job due to discrimination theres still a widespread perception of aboriginals as welfare leeches and drug addicts that prevents them from finding work and in turn their children end up in a similar situation being unable to provide equal opportunity to their own families my point is its not always choice that creates earnings gaps between different demographics as much as we like to think our freedomloving firstworld countries provide equally abundant opportunities for everyone i just think we need to be mindful of that,NOT
im not wondering at all either compete against boys or start transgender teams you are boys now biologically born girls who compete will never win as long as there are biologically born boys in the teams,ABU

im sorry but thats a guy it freaks me out to hear how people think this is ok one thing is being accepted by society and family but in sports where it is all about physical strength thats different,ABU
women work in different fields different fields pay different salary women have maternity leave so they take a cut on pay for it there is no wage gap if the gap existed every company would only hire women since it would be cheaper,NOT

there is a gender wage gap but there is no gender earnings gap everyone gets the same for the same work youve mixed up your terms,NOT
its disgusting how movements are hijacked by those who want attention people who never felt anything wrong with their identity or whats between their legs feel a sense of validation and special treatment by their peers when they come out being trans is hard people look at you like youre a freak its way harder to get a job and youre ostracised by your family in most cases i love and support anyone who legitimately feels theyve been born in the wrong body its an awful feeling but its also just a medical disorder individuals who make their personality around their medical records are like mothers who think having children makes them interesting its not that important it should be a minuscule aspect of who you are and the world does not need to know,NOT

why dont businesses only hire women i mean if that were the problem they would just pay men less i dont really have a stance on the wage gap but if the gap were true no one is forcing businesses to pay a different wage so they wouldnt only hire women they would pay men less,NOT

every time i hear about gender wage gap all i could think about is what jim jefferies said lol,NOT

women get paid less choices boys get worse grades rigged,NOT
beautiful went vegan nearly  years ago ill never eat animal products again and that makes me so happy,NOT
you could be pansexual if you like everybody,NOT
that likedislike ratio is glorious,NOT
the real question is why do you want to close the gender wage gap by closing that gap other gaps will exist like an age wage gap nationality wage gap political affiliation wage gap earring choice wage gap etc are you going to close all of them what for why so,NOT
inequality for rich people so sad doesnt it just break your heart,NOT
two black guys competing against girls,ABU

even the fellow black ladies are struggling to keep up with them thats a sign,NOT
they can run fast cuz their balls arent jiggling about any more,ABU
i mean i love the look of being a masc almost stereotypical lesbian sometimes because i feel good like that do i also like looking super feminine and pretty yes you can enjoy masculinity and femininity  but like what also she doesnt want theythemhehim pronouns so im perplexed,NOT
conclusion kids are to blame ,NOT
wait  years out of business school men have an average salary of  dollars average how is this real please tell me it isnt,NOT
like by the way with what she said but what the hell is with her face  is she on crack ,ABU

okay so my faaaaav vegan dinner of all time is rice and veggies so its jasmine rice or really any rice you want  then i cook the veggies i use onion broccoli mushrooms garbanzo beans and sometimes sweet potato but use whatever you enjoy with salt pepper garlic powder and soy sauce i dont use specific measurements just until i like how it tastes then after the veggies are cooked ill mix in the rice so it soaks up the soy sauce and other seasoning then serve it up so quick so good you need to try it,NOT
so shes attracted to gay mentherefore she is a gay man nah that jus sounds like fetishization,NOT
i think shes genderfluid and androsexual attracted to masculinity but shes just really confused and needs some help badly,ABU
as a vegan i dont recommend freelees diet its pretty crazy just eat normally minus animal products i mean for those who love her diet more power to you but i have tried it and i hate it so you just have to find what works for you,NOT
women and men earn the same amount of money for the same job in the same amount of work time period,NOT
ohmygod this is amazing,NOT
blaire is so logical and actually uses sense to explain things about being trasngender please knock some sense into her,NOT
screams marketing strategy they both lost their footage ok,NOT
 well i think the male brain tells itself that it is the alpha he is the most powerful person there and thus acts like it i dont have any knowledge in that field though,NOT
them white girls just lost,NOT
dont business like investment for example  hire men more often because the people paying for this feel more comfortable with a man instead of a women explaining this stuff its sexism but its what happens stem jobs dont really matter though since as long as the job is done its done,NOT
and of course i got a join the nra ad on this video ,NOT
quorn is tho as bad for the climate as eating pig because of the way its produced better for the environment to eat chicken then quorn eat soy instead much better lokal produced even better cool down if you get upset i talked about the environment not from an animal rights perspective,NOT
im so excited about this but you filmed this a month ago june favorites,NOT
thats actually horrible freelee made trisha watch slaughterhouse footage im a vegetarian and i never watch that it looks horrible,NOT
i love you blaire youre such is a bad bitch,ABU
a lot of it involves you learning how to cook but you can probably buy some frozen vegan meals eat beans you can eat pasta with vegetables and sum nut cheese,NOT
i just cant with her i am sorry i am assertive i like shooting cars outdoors but i like doing my makeup and hair i like to be lazy some days and not have any makeup on it all just depends on the day its called being human what its not called is being trans that is for damn sure,NOT
try gardein products theyre amazing,NOT
women also leave to have children which makes them riskier employees when in positions of power since you know eventually you will have to find a replacement to fill the position and also sets them back for several months per child or longer if they elect to stay home with it for longer,NOT
how about a transgender league of their own,ABU
shut the fuck up youre a chicken nugget a lesbian now a gay man and transgender this is a total slap in the face to trans people can you stop trolling people please enough is enough educate yourself,ABU
trish we all have feminine and masculine energy in us youre absolutely right that its our individual choice to be who we want to be on any given day i dont like saying him her im more a them they to encapsulate everyone or i refer to someone as a person and not a man or woman brice lee once said that he looks at everyone as human it resonated so much with me bc i see people as whole humansand not dissecting them into groups  b e whoever you want to be love ,NOT
i approve the message but not the messengers for crying out loud why would you try to influence adults through a child what are the chances a  year old knows more then a mature adult its immature pathetic and patronizing how dare you,NOT
i thought the title was what people miss about gender,NOT
so me buying avocados thats been shipped with planes through the whole world or veggies that kill billions of insects and small animals is better than buying a local gras fed steak  dont think so ,NOT
but you can expect to gain some weight that is very normal and it will shed of so fast later you wont believe it,NOT
thank you thank you for this video i always knew this was a load of crp but now i know why,NOT

when betches tell me that i should shut up about abortion because im a man im like betch did you just assume my gender you transphobic piece of shet,ABU
check out mommy tang she has great recipes,NOT
the video correctly points out the disproportional amount of time women spend on child rearing duties some of these duties are dictated by nature pregnancy breast feeding etc to the extend that the gap in the remaining duties can be closed i would say this women who are bothered by this gap should choose partners that are on board with a  split in those duties but please spare us any grand social engineering schemes that try to correct this imbalance at a societal level,NOT
hi to zach efron when did this happen,NOT
rice beans tofu veggies peanut butter almond milk and lots of smoothies so excited u jointed the vegan community youre going to love it ,NOT
this is such horseshit clearly her glam and outfit tell this video is old and shes constantly posting vlogs about eating non vegan things and in her cook with me grocery haul on her vlog channel she references piggies sizzling and shes cooking bacon and apologizes to all the vegans and says she tried to go vegan for a hot minute this video is clearly the hot minute its fucking pathetic she would even upload this knowing she didnt stick with it,ABU
i am attracted to gay men which is why i identify myself as a gay man,NOT
so women can work  nights and make six figures in las vegas and strippers or what about getting tipswomen get much better tips then men and in vegas makes thousands in a night or twowhat about adult moviesthere are many things women make huge money that men cant make do you think they add this when they make wage gap claims,NOT
no single study can correctly identify the real gap which is barely recognizable,NOT
stop humiliating yourself your pathetic just stop youtube you dont deserve this platform everyone likes to have views but this is a new low your disgusting and vile youre an embarrassment she is jumping on the bandwagon,NOT
someoneplease make it make sense,NOT
anyone know how tall trisha is,NOT
i love you trisha but wtf you sound crazy af jason dodged a bullet with this one,ABU
am i transgender  do i identify as my natural born gender  um,ABU
i want to see another video from chs that explains finally why are feminists unable to comprehend this logic and common sense,NOT
more like transspecies human to land whale,ABU
i wonder why we dont hear about biological girls who transition to transmales and compete against boys probably because they would get crushedwhat say the feminists,NOT
just made my year vegan anniversary and going to make my future kids vegan too hope the world realizes is the best change for your health and for mother earth ,NOT
fuck this is disturbing kick them the hell out,ABU
good luck trying to go back to eating meat i did that after i was vegan for yr and a half my stomach literally fucked me up my stomach was so fucking sore but now im vegan again i eat bananas the majority of the day i eat toast looove toast i eat potatoes rice pasta at night watch mommytang she has the best vegan recipes,NOT
spaghetti you can make it super fast and add tons of veggies to the sauce i love making it spicy,NOT
i think this is completley idiotic idk i think you should just stick with ehat you are and never try to be somet you arent,NOT
so proud of you girl you dont have to be as skinny as freelee but if you did it right you will become the best version if yourself and you will feel freaking amazing,NOT
either the world ends or we become vegan how is a not insane person supposed to take this seriously you realize you literally have a mental problem if you believe this right this is literally the same as me saying we have to acknowledge the world is flat or else well all die pure stupidity hey crazy people explain to me how purchasing pasture raised meat is destroying the environment lololool yeah lets ignore the actual science and just brainwash people im sure this will work out absolutely great,ABU
i hate this channel now they went full feminist,NOT
im surprised at the amount of people that think shes seriousdont realize shes trolling,NOT
hahahahaha im trans but im okay with my birth sex when trisha says it its crazy but when all the  genders say it its acceptable,NOT
this is killing me girl first of all i choose not to identify as multiple personality are you kidding second what the fuck littrally no,NOT
these comments are homophobic ,NOT
i understand why men hate the feminist movement men are not personally responsible for the devaluation of womens work to tackle this problem from the perspective of feminism is a mistake because it points the finger at men rather the finger should be pointed to capitalism businesses pay women less now and historically because they can and could so yes i believe in equal work for equal pay yet the lower paying jobs seem to be womens work is it then actually a choice or enslavement,NOT
yeah bur this makeup is super cute tho uwu,NOT
shes obviously just confused about herself so can yall stop bullying and memeing people to the point where theyre likely to get depressed and eventually kill themselves cause if she does everyone in this comment section gonna pull a  and be like oh im gonna miss you rip pls bring awareness to mental health,NOT
women and men have the same rights in the western world it is all about the choices we make most women choose easier career paths and work less hours to raise children that is their own choice there is nothing wrong about it in the west men and women also share home care duties and raise children together in the western world job vacancies are offered to women and men at the same wage most men are more flexible and work long hours that is why they can make more money feminists hate independent women and use them to escalate in politics and in the company they are selfish beings feminists detest men but use them they want to share the partners bank account to also spend his salary and not happy with that they claim half of the mans assets and a pension when they divorce strong independent women never stop educating themselves overcoming bad times working hard being responsible and fair with men strong women do not fall into feminists fallacies there is not such a gender wage gap strong women respect men and women alike because independent women look far beyond the genre real women praise the individual feminists created a women day only aka discriminating men how low this is would feminists feel happy if men declare a day only for themselves lets stop with this game,ABU
this video made me so happy its so cute,NOT
girl you make me so gay thooooo also i loved your cute little squeak that you made after you said im deceased,NOT
youll get paid the same if you do as good a job,NOT
jesus its so painful to listen to her vocal fry,NOT
things not addressed that would be helpful for further research are there simply fewer women in the highest paying fields or do these fields pay more because they are male dominated in cases of change where more men go into traditionallyfemale fields such as teaching and nursing does this drive up wages across the board or just for male employees do both genders really have the same access to all professional fields or do recruiting hiring and training processes seem to favor one gender over another in certain fields ie is it a matter of simple choice or are our choices curated before they get to us how have increasing trends in women working in higher skilled educated fields impacted wages overall ie is there any evidence that wages go down in a field when more women enter it what differences in socialization based on gender impact things like negotiating wage applying for jobs which you dont necessarily have all the qualifications for etc,NOT
i find all this logic and factual evidence offensive too much common sense for me to handle,NOT
being a man is just easier being trans isnt for your convenience its not a choice and your demeaning trans people and the use of theythem please educate yourself,NOT
creat a new category for those kids,ABU
they do have unfair advantage sports is about sex not gender soon all bio born girls will be sitting watching their own sport cause selfish people like these ,NOT
this documentary makes me cry happy tears  im so happy for this amount of change in just one year vegan for  years now and counting d congrats pbn  bring on ,NOT
as a vegan i like to eat fruit in the morning with cereal and i also eat fruit as a snack in the afternoon for lunch and dinner i like to have veggiess and starches and occasionally ill eat tofu or beans for protein you should try vegan curry with tofu broccoli carrots green beans and potatoes served over rice its one of my favorites,NOT
i kind of understand trisha i always was interested in guys that are femine i was also attracted to this one girl who was really masculine basically i am attracted to people that are between genders although i like masculine guys also when i was younger i always was gay guy in my erotic dreams still to this day i sometimes have a dick in my dreams however i dont think about changing my gender im comfortable enough in my skin to say that since guys usually prefer women i wanna stay female additionally if i cant be a handsome guy i rather not be a guy at all if she have similar issues to me then i think she is overreacting maybe trying to get the attention she succeeded edit i written it while still watching i am now sure she is there only for the attention,NOT
looking forward to more progress in  thanks to everyone who contributed in exposing the truth about health environment and cruelty of meat and dairy industry,NOT
im a communist but the liberals are horrible now a days i hate feminist especially theres no wage gap,NOT
this really opened my eyes thanks for sharing this information,NOT
damn this video is just as sexy as anything youd find on pornhub,NOT
but they allow little girls to play little league football with boys idgaf it a fucking cheetah run with them all males aint stronger than women physically i done body slammed and beat the fuck up a few males in my day,NOT
english and history teachers are brainwashing my classmates with this wage gap propaganda,NOT
tell me why your snaps give major blue balls quit teasing girl,ABU
im not vegan but i try not to eat dairy and i feel like when im not eating dairy i feel better and my skin isnt as bad,NOT
was this expository or persuasive im doing a paper on this video and i need a persuasive source,NOT
freelee that was recorded a month ago to prepare for her music video so shes not vegan anymore it was only for the views in her newest vlog she ate cheesecake,NOT
so there are smart people out there who wouldve guessed,NOT
that was a nice video but please consider not eating in videos anymore is sounds really annoying,NOT
get you some sweet potatoes cut them up into cubes and put them on a roasting pan with those baby carrots and drizzle olive oil garlic salt and red pepper flakes on them roast in the oven at  for about  minutes and you will love it good luck,NOT
i got an ad for jimins birthday before the video happy birthday jimin,NOT
they are born boys they need to compete on the boys team,ABU
everyone wants to roll out of bed and just go dont think it was the haircut but go off,NOT
freelee i swear ,NOT
youtube is suggesting that the next video i watch is called there is no gender wage gap from prageru which implies that this is the type of video watched by many who watched this one thats interesting because this video provides a nuanced understanding of the gap based on research while im fairly certain prageru based on many of their other vidoes does not of course if there was no gap there would be at least some industries in which men are underpaid which do not currently exist hats off to vox for making the argument of those crazies in a noncrazy rational manner,NOT
this girls vocal fry is really annoying,NOT
her eyes stared into my soul,NOT
so question since im not  well informed is she just nuts or confused in terms of what she is would this fall more to the trans community as gender nonconforming genderqueer help a dude out,NOT
i believe in you trish the biggest tips i have are to really look at labels and to just find things you like to eat and find vegan alternatives to the non vegan foods you like almost everything not vegan pretty much has a vegan alternative you live in such a good place for it too la has so many vegan restaurants and shops im so excited for you,NOT
start eating some nutritious dense food  meat  and stop destroying the earth with crops and vegetable farming,NOT
i guess trying to be black got boring for her so now she wants to try her hand at trans she makes it so hard to actually like her and stand up for her,NOT
but your eating chicken in your snapchat story,NOT
its not sexism its a result of societal sexism that makes her hate her own gender,NOT
i dont think its right for everyone to immediately bash her shes clearly confused and its not her fault for being so society loves labels and theyre confusing her did she say some stuff that she didnt understand in this video hell yes lmao but bashing her is not going to solve things can we be positive for once and help her,NOT
dude wtf did she just say,NOT
its problematic for young people when people post this crap when i was a young woman i didnt understand being an aromantic asexual  just that i didnt want to date the guys that asked me out i liked short haircuts and doc martens and the whole punk look in general i didnt really wear any makeup until i was in my early s if i had seen all this nonsense at that time i would have been questioning whether i was transgender becasue they equate being a girl that wears short hair as male to female transgender or gender fluid because every once in a while you do your eyebrows and wear mascara its not just annoying its confusing for people who are really trying to figure things out when my brother was in kindergarten they read cinderella to his class he waved his hand and said when i grow up i hope i have a pretty dress like hers why because my brother is an attention hound and went for the laugh at any opportunity they called my mother in for a talk which was stupid but if it happened now with all of this bs he would be called transgender and someone would be trying to give him hormones,NOT
karma will come for us one day we will all be eaten alive then how are u gonna feel,NOT
wow im attracted to straight men wow i am now a straight woman,NOT
so proud love you and hope you stick with it,NOT
 trish  i been there myself as you narrr ,NOT
does vox know the difference between earning and making i smell liberal arts degrees and spoiled middle class income brats,NOT
go ahead and read a script you puppet,NOT
jason was a bottom k,NOT
what did i just watch,NOT
you never see them mention garbage truck drivers or seweragewater treatment site workers on the lists,NOT
im really glad vox gave an intelligent person the job rather than carlos maza,NOT
what girl hasnt thought it would be easier with a  no periods yes please,NOT
what i learned from this video go to business school,NOT
i see boysyou say what you want,NOT
two my teachers are on maternitythats the wage gap,NOT
its great that you dont blame it on discrimination try to explain it and be completley neutral,NOT
 who is the guy being interviewed here,NOT
i lived in a communist country and i can confirmed we never heard of gap gender wage before whats going on us ,NOT
nobody is wondering anything basic biology dictates that they have an advantage,NOT
if you like brussels sprouts fried you should try them roasted with sliced shallots a little bit of olive oil salt and pepper roasting you can get the same crispiness and flavor but its a lot less oil and fat cruciferous vegetables like that are soooo good for you and so filling sending good vibes and love your way ,NOT
omg yes they are two beautiful vegan women now go trisha this is gonna be the best decision of your life freelee you got it  ill be forever thankful,NOT
these two dudes are so selfish,ABU
run faster quit complaining,NOT
i just dont see how a wage gap matters much when youre making k,NOT
so if conor mcgregor identified as a woman and he got in the ring and kick the s out of ronda rousey how would everybody feel about that,NOT
i dont think this is an accomplishment l bullying people into veganism she even states she did not like your approach at all maybe you will take her advice and stop with your selfish clickbait ways,NOT
i guess im a man now v,NOT
finally a video that gives good insight on the gender wage gap,NOT
women need to be positive this gap decreases,NOT
why does every last word in her sentences sounds like a cat with influenza,NOT
is trisha black,NOT
so wouldnt it be more empowering to i dont know compete against boys,NOT
they really should feel some guilt inside for this their structure isnt female,ABU
i like eating vegan for health reasons but linking it to climate bs does not promote veganism,NOT
i think shes united both sides of the political isle in the name of what the fuck,NOT
field of business demands lot of skills couple are risk taking and dominant behavior men are naturally more risk takers and try to defeat their rivals hence men on field of business generally tend to do better results and hence are more desirable therefore better pay also there is no such thing as wage gap its earning gab which is based on experience education talent how long they spend at job and how often they get sick once these things have been taken into account then that gab suddenly is almost nothing,NOT
if men truly did make  more than women then that would be a truly raw deal for men  men die on the job  times more than women  men are  times more likely to work two jobs and work over time  men have a much much higher injury rate and burn out rate  men have less perks a lot of companies dont have paternity leave  men by far work more dangerous jobs and more remote jobs  men see their families far less  men are the vast majority of combat deaths and for all that men only get  more its should be  or  times more now if the gov forces salaries to be equal then its clearly men who get screwed yes when we hear  women and  men died in a coal mine accident then talk about equality until then men are screwed,NOT
i cant beleive people took trisha serious lmao,NOT
she will get so much shit now d ,NOT
i would definitely say you are confused you should do more research before you make a video like this,NOT
freelee what should i do if i want to be vegan but my mum wont let me whats a substitute or like a non meat diet i can do,NOT
babe im just on my second week of being vegan and im loving it i thought id run out of stuff that id like to eat but i actually like the foods that ive been eating i also have more energy now im glad youve decided to do this and i hope you keep going ,NOT
masculinity and femininity are not genders  wow ok preach blaire ,NOT
good video but i have the feeling it is important to contrast some points  until recently women didnt have the same access to the education or leading position as men actually only one think remained from that period the idea that women are in charge of the children more than men this way of thinking creates a lot of problem because entering in trouble with going up the career ladders for women as a woman you are really more likely to be less available for your job than men  again because men have been used to occupate leader positions men are still now doing more studies related to this women on the contrary will do study according to the image built given to her linked to their housing task listen take care and so on explaining why they are more often following those studies to conclude i would say that facts presented in that video are true but i think we still need to change the way we see women in the society in my opinion it just cannot be denied that this salary gap is not directly wanted anymore but still due to a wrong old patriarchal way of thinking,NOT
okay boo so basically u gotta throw away all of your leather bags leather shoes if you want to go on a plant based diet however thats different,NOT
what pronouns does she prefer dumbdumber,ABU
 women work less hours on average  women are less likely to ask for a raise this explains the wage gap within same occupations,NOT
i dont do my hairi never do my makeup pretty sure im not a gay man and im not trans,NOT
my mom had a solution for my dad not pulling his weight around the house she stop doing laundry and got a job so my dad became a stay at home dad,NOT
its confusing but i get it in a way,NOT
i would go vegan but my family is on a budget and if i got some fruit and stuff for myself then everyone in my effing family would eat it and  days in i would have no food to eat,NOT
try some oatmeal sweet potatoes pancakes and cereal for breakfast try some baked fries burritos rice bowl quinoa with steamed kale for lunch,NOT
just try dont sneakily go eat some ham or dairy without your fans knowing it because the begging part of it all is the work things because of all the withdrawals but eventually you will realise how much better you feel,NOT
id love to go vegan but i cant afford it ive tried it before and its extremely expensive,NOT
this is actually the craziest rudest ignorant fucking video i have ever seen,NOT
hey blaire i have a good topic for you to vid the ellen  bush video i thought it was heartwarming  then i had a facebook person post this about it  not to mention how its really privileged to be able to simply get along with people of different opinions i love ellen but her privilege is showing let me know what you think,NOT
  carbs make you sick lmao,NOT
it is an unfair advantage biology still makes them stronger than the natural born girls period,ABU
yaaaay trisha  just dont eat to little cause youll feel like shit and blame veganism  but good luck sweetheart d btw i know youre scared to gain weight but if it happens please dont give up i mean talk to freelee or something if you ever feel doubtful because as you said her body dont lie ,NOT
ive been vegan for a couple months now and youll love it your body is going to feel amazing and while youre doing it for the two weeks keep educating yourself on the health animal and environment aspects of it because youll never want to go back its so easy to stay vegan because there are alternatives and recipes for everything like right now i have vegan brownies in the oven right now i would say youre plant based because veganism is really about your whole lifestyle but your on the right track and its not something i did overnight i eased into first vegetarian then plantbased then no more leather fur etc and cruelty free productsi have a vegan beauty channel inspired by my fave vegan freelee where the only products i promote and cruelty free good luck with this trish and i hope you stay vegan forever  and get shane to do this with you,NOT
shes a troll shes doing it for views and to stay relevant which is what all these response videos are giving her yall think youre so smart but in reality youre just giving her what she wanted lol,NOT
add greek subs pleaseee,NOT
so at one point freelee said it took her many years to lose weight on the rt diet at another point  when writing her book the story changed and she said it took many months to lose weight so how the hell is this supposed to help trisha lose weight quickly,NOT
stop lying come on this is total crap alarmist bull animal agriculture is not ruining the planet get rid of all the plant based packaged food shipped all over the world that world help more veganism is there to confuse stop with all the carb eating,ABU
i am interested in this university does this school have a football program if so do you let people in for football scholarships,NOT
 good facts,NOT
all the support and encouragement going your way for giving veganism a chance eat as much as you want so you dont crave animal products but dont stuff yourself sick if you need any tips or recipe ideas you can dm me anytime or check my ig best of luck trish ,NOT
is she reading something,NOT
facts are facts they will never be females naturally this nonsense must stop now let them run with the boys da fuck is wrong with the world now remove them from the sport or create seperate fake shit for them since they are fake period,ABU
its not a question about it shrinking or what it is its still a gap and still is something we have to fix,NOT
what kind of character does someone have who dislikes this video good video though,NOT
one of her recent vlogs and she was eating bacon,NOT
they say women are oppressed one minute then say women dont exist and there are really  genders another,NOT
she needs to come out of the closet and identify as being the awful human she was born to be,ABU
i stopped eating pigs after i read charlottes web and then i got a pet lamb and stopped eating sheep and so on and so forth if you cant do vegan trish start with vegitarian and try vegan again in a couple years as long as youve improved to be more ethical youre doing a great thing,NOT
quote extinction rebellions aim is to bring the government to a halt these idiots need to be locked away as they are nothing more than criminals they are guilty of sedition below are the definitions of their criminal intent sedition and treason while used interchangeably are different both in definition and use sedition is conduct or language inciting rebellion against the authority of the state treason is a violation of allegiance towards your country especially betrayal in war or providing comfort to an enemy time to put these enemies of the state to account of their crimes lock them away in a mental institution,ABU
also people truly forget that life is not and will never be fair,NOT
trisha paytas is a mess,ABU
am i a vegan  yes do i also eat meat  yes,NOT
the democrats think these freaks are normal,ABU
because salaries are negotiated god damn that why dont businesses only hire women is so tired the issue is positions and occupations as well if you dont actually understand the issue maybe not talk about it and if there is no gap then a law requiring no gap would do nothing so its a win win and if you argue against a winwin situation than that means you want someone to lose,NOT
you mean an earnings gap pay gap wage gap is misleading and close to intellectual dishonest also sticking to the premises that the earnings gap is bad for women is odd since you dont really explain why its bad,NOT
im surprised by vox a liberalleaning website made a measured explanation of the wage gap and did not harp over the infamous  statistic that so many institutions continue trying to use to make their case the points in the video were valid and did not represent a misconstrued viewpoint overall very effective,NOT

ive been vegan now for   months and lost  lbs and i am a high carb vegan i eat brown rice and potatoes mostly and its extremely satisfying go on pinterest and look up vegan and youll find a lot of good ideas also follow hot for food and lauren toyota she and freelee were the reason i went vegan,NOT
another parallel between you and i trish i am too attempting to go vegan i hate meat  dont like eggs the only think im having a hard time with is dairy milkcheese i love me some fruits and veggis and nuts and rice and beans etc my downfall is sugar which technically is ok to eat when vegan so i need to find some self control on that front the common mistake i am making is just like when you said you accidentally had starbucks that had milk you have to break the bad habits one good thing is that there is so many channels and websites out there to help you know what to eat i suggest before going to any food restaurants ie taco bell starbucks cheesecake factory etc you check out their menu online and figure out what you will order prior to going i know its easy to be caught up in the whole process and order things that you used to order or you get there and you dont want to hold up the line so you order something without thinking it through you have to remember that its easy to go vegan and stay fat trust me i know this i too am about lbs too and i too hope to get healthier through going vegan french fries are vegan but when you get them say from mcdonalds or bk they are soaked in salt then salted again and again and again when being served then the fried aspect on top of that i know you know this i just used that as an example  usually hardcore vegans arent vegans to be skinny they are vegan because they are against all animal cruelty then the health benefits are just a plus you can get vitamins too to help you make sure youre getting everything your body needs maybe freelee can help with telling you which you should take while doing this  week vegan diet love you bunches trisha and i know you can do it dont cheat,NOT

the greatest thing about this is that a woman is speaking and has sources from a feminist organization the key piece missing here is that the smaller percentage of women being hired in stem fields science technology engineering and math are actually paid more than men due to corporate demographic quotas so though women may be under represented in those fields by choice it is actually discriminatory towards men in the aspect of payroll savethemales,NOT

i have yet to find an employer who would pay me  more than the women until laws are changed they are required to pay me more for being a man but the women are still getting paid equal to or more than me,NOT
they come in first and second consistentlythat alone should tell you they have an unfair advantage,ABU
its milli vanilli all over again ,NOT
i left a super long comment yesterday on ts video explaining much of what you said blaire because i am trans as well and hearing her reasoning made me super concerned for her trolling or not i didnt comment in a way to ridicule her but inform her i feel she is confused on what she feels and who she is again if it isnt a troll she is not transgender safe to say that she would be transitioning for the wrong reasons entirely and will more than likely regret the choice to undergo permanent steps that she cant come back from i more or less got alarmed when t said paraphrasing gender can change with each day right at the end of the video great work blaire,NOT
there is no wage gap get over it vox,ABU
feminists dont care about facts if you want to make them listen you need to say i feel every other sentence and conclude by finding some way to blame men no matter what,NOT

no trisha this aint it sis i dont think sis when even knows what transgender means,NOT
im so proud of you this is amazing trish ,NOT
men and women make different choices even that study that compares house hold chores with full time working parents doesnt take into account that while the work is considered full time the men are working insanely more hours especially when full time in these studies is pegged at  hours men routinely will work  hours in their jobs women value flexibility over pay this has been proven in countless surveys and studies yet vox seems to think that you should be able to have flexible hours aka not work as much but some how he paid the same there is no discrimination going on there is no social conditioning in a master patriarchal scheme to make women think they want flexible hours men and women make different choices and thats ok stop creating discontent where it is not warranted women in the west are the freest and liberated peoples on the globe just stop it,NOT
these radical feminists dont understand how math works how economy works,NOT

two guys who cant win at the male events now have to cheat in the womens events,NOT
well obviously theyll always win no matter what even if they identity as female their lungs and organs are bigger women and men were created differently by nature the man will win against a woman this isnt hating if youre trans you do you although if youre at a natural physical advantage thats plain selfish to keep competing this way,ABU
this woman was a feminst during second wave feminism,NOT
when vox makes a video about the wage gap but then gets hit with reality in the comments,NOT
so are they saying women if you are in a field that pays less to women then to men why dont you just find a job that with a less but still present wage gap ,NOT

yes trish this is exactly what you need for a healthy body and mind you really need to stick with it to get great results but in the end it is worth it  make sure youre eating until youre completely satisfied and full so proud of you trish this is a great step in the right direction ,NOT
trish being vegan isnt just diet its s lifestyle you have to watch not only what you eat but the makeup you use to the simple clothes or even nail polish you use i think you need to be more educated with being vegan before you do it,NOT
maybe you have body dysmorphia  youre tomboy or youre androgynous,NOT
become the person u wanna be,NOT
not that you ever read my comments anyways however i will say ive tried the vegan thing just all fruit and you can still gain weight if youre not like freelee riding a damn bicycle  miles or more daily youre not working on anything youre eating so it doesnt matter what youre eating so being vegan or vegetarian for that matter does not matter as far as losing weight stopping the dairy not eating red meat will certainly help you but you still should count calories and watch your intake eat lots of protein you can do this trish do it for the animals ive always thought of being vegan also why i havent started and or started and kept doing it i dont know one day i do love those people who are vegans one for what they stand for when it comes to the animals however theres a lot of drama going on in the vegan community and i wont say any names or anything else but i am sometimes scared of becoming a vegan because im afraid it will turn me into a real bitch lol,NOT
another thing i know vegetarians and began are different ik vegitarians dont eat meat and ik vegans dont eat anything from animals but what i dont know is the kind of things vegans dont eat so someone please spend like  to  mins educating me on what kind of stuff vegans dont eat ik one is eggs but i dont know if vegans drink milk or eat cheese,NOT
but when will something be done about the pay gap between white men and asian men this oppression must end,NOT
its about averages cant you fools math,NOT

you guys are bad and you should feel bad,NOT
this is so stupid it makes my head hurt this is not how research is conducted god help this woman,NOT
wait isnt this the same channel that thinks climate change is a hoax,NOT
i see a lot of people on this thread commenting about how the wage gap doesnt exist and that this is feminist propaganda but they fail to see that the extremist view of the feminist is that there is a wage gap out of malicious intent from males where in the real world the wage gap is a combination of unfortunate circumstances and averages between differing career choices while i believe we should challenge the extreme interpenetration of the wage gap i do believe it in fact exists and we should be doing more to understand it rather than shifting blame or denying its existence,NOT
you could try plantbased cheese and plantbased meat they taste better than real cheese and meat  are much healthier  cruelty free the brands i use are daiya vegan cheese gardein vegan meat they have chicken strips and other things and lightlife vegan meat they have good bacon and eat rice beans pasta veggies etc and keep eating fruit,NOT
abc news fucking npcs sorry they have a penis your a dude not a girl,ABU
im just glad the word patriarchy wasnt used so i listen and shes got some pretty valid points i think,NOT
trish i truly truly hope youre making this life style change to help our world not just to lose weight being a vegan does not mean suddenly lose  pounds it takes so much dedicated and planning being an unhealthy vegan is a true thing and its so easy to do all i can ask is learn as much as you can about this lifestyle and enjoy the fact youre helping our planet in so many different ways i hope this is the beginning of a new and beautiful journey ,NOT
ima be real i wasnt paying attention to the video cause i was losing my shit over these comments ,NOT
why is the lady complaing when she has that huge of a smile ,NOT
lol did trish do this as a joke to freelee,NOT
this is the stupidest explanation ive heard firstly women choice to do easily jobs secondly women choice useless degrees thirdly women choice to stay home and get free money and lastly how can you be a nurse and expect to be pay the same as a doctor thats not possible feminist isnt about women its about power do the hours work hard like men and get pay dont do less hours work less and expect big salary,NOT
what it is your creepy obsession,NOT
yess vegans take over,NOT
there are only two genders and there is no gender wage gap thats the true,NOT
who is wondering wtf,NOT
i think i get what ur saying like u feel like a feminine man and that fine i honestly think most of the people are giving u crap cause they dont understand you and no one really understands someone elses dysphoria and them wanting to transition i support you amd i really hope you find your true self without all the hate cause you really dont need that good luck t,NOT
make sure you eat more than you normally would eat as much fruit and veg as you want and dont feel restricted because people who have tried going vegan stopped after awhile because they just werent eating enough and were not getting the right amount of nutrients good luck ,NOT
i kind of understand like i am so much alike my gay friends but im not a gay male im a bisexual female im more masculine then a normal woman but it makes me unique and myself it doesnt make me trans i always fall for the gay guys too but thats just bad luck youll figure yourself out trish ,NOT
congratulations on going vegan stay strong and slay everyday,NOT
as an unemployed woman im offended that i dont make the same salary as a man working  hours a week the wage gap has to be real,NOT
ngl shame on you for neglecting her opinion you cant just trash and decline how she does feel inside whether it makes since to many or not her trying to come out to the world isnt easy people should stay in their own lane including you because you cant understand how shes feeling i understand you most likely have different feelings that led you to your transition but honestly back off be understanding for her your video should seriously be taken down,NOT
and now she is an exvegan hahahahahahahahaha,NOT

can you react pewdiepies latest video i cringed,NOT
tldw men and women make different choices also in case vox is sitting at home scratching their heads wondering why da people whoz watch our videos no like dis video  its because you guys are usually not fair andor objective this is one of the rare times where you mostly are people who saw vox making a gender pay gap video automatically assumed you would be spewing the same old biased bullshit,ABU
show us youre dick,ABU
you can do it trish  dont worry if you fail just dont give up and keep trying and problem solving until you get it lots of people will be happy to help,NOT
my mother has  children works full time and has been the number one salesman in her company for the last several years she sells the most product in the entire company and yet she is still payed less than some of the men in her company who sell less product per year explain,NOT
feminist will now complain that they do more in the household nowgreat,NOT
you not considering that working women tend to have kids and female artist get paid much less compare to male actors,NOT
this is what happens when its all about the heart  feelings nowadays getting into the laws there you go people keep trusting the heart whoever trusts in his own heart is stupid prov  truly sad it does not belong to man who is walking even to direct their step jeremiah  got a bible question,NOT
another factually inaccurate video from vox no wayyyyyy,NOT
full support really great decision,NOT
amazing to see there are still people who get triggered by facts this dinosaur is extinct the pay gap doesnt exist when employers pay equal dollars per unit of outcome there is no such thing as a pay gap move on to our next problem please next are there fairies in the garden,NOT
so basically this says the problem revolves around taking care of children which women are biologically wired to be more inclined to do therefore theyre trading their job and thus their pay for their children a choice they decided to make if you work less you should get paid less so employers arent to blame if taking care of her children makes a woman happier then she should take care of her children in the end the wage gap is caused by biological processes that arent inherently good or bad which we cant control this means that the wage gap exists but isnt a problem,NOT
after watch erthlings  and dominion  became a vegan in march  best decision ever ,NOT
i dont do my nails my make up my hair or dress up i guess im a man wow all my life i thought i was a tomboy but i guess not sarcasm,NOT
i wish instead she had said this isnt sexism its capitalism,NOT
its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,NOT
you are a trans icon,NOT
yaaaassss diva you will love being vegan you will feel amazing all the time you just have to make sure you eat healthy and clean and most importantly eat enough which is more than what you think is enough,NOT
veganism is now,NOT
i put on hair and makeup when i want to and go without it and male clothes when im at home thats not trans its clothes are comfy and makeup takes time omfg trisha also she came out as a chicken nugget once,NOT
its unfair period he still have the genetics of a male which makes him faster and stronger,NOT
stop it get some help,NOT
so thats how the wage gap was calculated they completely forgot to add all the variables to the equation like part time time off and types of jobs,NOT
soooooo youre queer not trans,NOT
you should get some pammies for the fall  pam andersons vegan ugg like boots forksoverknivescom for recipes xo,NOT
it isnt a wage gap its an earnings gap women earn less because they provide less useful services to the people no one is going to pay you  to teach preschool no women want to grind away at an oil rig or learn math to become engineer college girls would rather party and go into education,ABU
yay trish good luck i have a tip if youre worried about gaining weight on the vegan diet i would stay away from all of the processed food and junk food like chips and oreos because not all vegan food is necessarily healthy just stay carbed up on fruit veggies and grains and you probably wont be craving anything unhealthy ,NOT
i have been vegan for  months now and ive lost kg and feel better than ever you go trish,NOT
half the people commenting make no indication that they even watched the video,NOT
bruh are u ok,NOT
wtf this is not fair at all you need to tell me if i claim to be a woman i can compete in female races coz of suppressing testosterone im becoming a millionaire in a year lol,NOT
what a disaster it just keeps getting worse,NOT
hey trish you okay  lmao someone help this gal,NOT
go vegan please,NOT
the gender wage gap has been disproven a million times by a million different people including economists independent researchers and even the government the only reason that it appears this way in some studies is because the studies are not done correctly rather than look at the average pay for people working the same hours at the same job at the same company and the only variable being gender the look at the total amount of money earned by women and men in the united states which is not how you do statistics this is because it does not include the types of jobs people from the two genders are choosing for example the stem fields which pay among the highest salaries are almost solely male despite the colleges trying to convince women to go into stem for many many years the mainly female dominated industries are things like childcare cosmetics and social studies which do not pay anywhere near as much as the male dominated stem fields and other male dominated areas please stop spouting the third wave feminist nonsense as fact because its objectively not,NOT
logic exists trisha no,NOT
lol this is vodka btw ,NOT
is it bad eating fish fish dont feel pain fish do not speak nor do they have visible emotions,NOT
 feminist disliked this video,NOT
 when he as she takes away any chance of fair play and actual effort of females then they should not be there,ABU
trisha ur gonna get so damn fit and toned everyone is going to be drooling over you as if u need anymore of that love u trish so proud of you,NOT
 weeks laterback to meat classic click bait,NOT
at first you gain a bit of weight because you are used to starving but then like after some time you will start to lose the weight,NOT
we dont have a gender pay gap we have a gender wage gap when we say that there is no pay gap that means that in the united states men and women are paid the same for instance if theyre getting offered a job as a starting position at mcdonalds or a teacher at a public school its illegal to discriminate on the basis of race gender or any other condition men and women are being paid the same in all hourly paid jobs but how much many men and women choose to work and how they work is the difference aside from women not even participating in certain strenuous industries like construction or landscaping where a lot of physical labor is required and there is a lot of money to be made women are also not keen to do jobs that are highpaying and heavy in mathematics and sciences as proved by college degree acquisitions modern women have had access to college for decades now and women are now the majority in college participation in the united states and yet women still steer clear from math and science degrees the women are choosing that nobody is stopping women from getting that boring math calculus or rocket science class these disparities are more than enough to account for the difference in how much the average woman and man earns in america now specifically to this video the most important issue is female psychology the idea that women dont want to work in general many women may value their alone time and prefer to have down time they may not want to work as many hours as men do not just for children but for their own personal development i know that not all women fit this archetype in fact the hardest working person i knew that used to work everyday two jobs was a woman so there certainly are busybee women out there thats not most women though most women dont want to be workaholics and more men are prone to being workaholics what i think is interesting is that even in this video we see this aspect of women wanting to avoid work playing out in this video we see how the way to improve things would be to make things more flexible and that men should do more housework in other words this video is pandering to the people who want things to be made easier for them make things easier on me its too hard to work  hours a day make it  hours and give us more vacation and more money this is exactly the attitude that im talking about when i say that many men and women simply dont want to work or are always looking to push their work away a true mother wouldnt bemoan all the hours she spends caring for her children a person that loves to work wouldnt be thinking about when the next time they get off is gonna come were talking about different psychologies here this isnt even to do with women or men because ive seen hardworking individuals on both sides and people who prefer doing recreational activities who are both males and females its just that our culture happens to promote female recreational attitudes a bit more the reality is under a free market the hardworking people are going to outcompete and outclass the people who want more recreation in general thats the trade off that people who want more free time must make more free time equals less money under equal circumstances this video makes it look as if wanting free time or wanting more recreation is even desirable do you realize there are workaholics who never take any vacations and who never even have a day off and still have time to take care of their multiple kids let alone  or  kids that the average female worker has let the workers work let the market give the job to the men and women who actually want to work without complaining,NOT
its unfair and idiotic but i hate how the news went and used a non native speaker to speak for the people maybe if they allowed her to speak in her native language but shes struggling to make her point in english so she comes across as stupid the news organizations agenda im sure,ABU
great inspiring movie my only criticism is the music the music is totally unnecessary  its way overdone and distracts from the message,NOT

best thing ever get bananas that are very ripe the more brown the sweeter and cut them up and put them in a baggy in the freezer cut up lots then in the morning put frozen bananas and cocoa powder healthy and blend it so its kind of slushy then put it in a bowl then in the same blender mix frozen strawberries and cocoa powder i use what is already left from bananas and mix to the same consistency then add to the bowl of bananas and on top add any fruit you want its legit the best and do filling,NOT

shes gonna be a detransitioner i stg,NOT
she should change her name to trisha potatoes,NOT
there is a girl in my school who claims to be feminist she always brings up the wage gap and how it is wrong when we were having a debate in class i brought up all the points i learned in this video and she didnt care she is too hypnotized into believing what she wants to believe that she cant even think about the idea of there not being a wage gap after instantly shutting me down before i could finish talking she went on to say that everyone deserves equal pay and free speech,NOT
another awesome video,NOT
its fantastic that you want to try this but please understand that you will not lose weight in  weeks from eating this way the only way to lose weight in  weeks is to starve yourself bad obviously a low fat high carb vegan diet with loads of fruit and veggies does work long term health weight etc but you may not see significant weight loss for anywhere from a couple of months to possibly a year or more it took me close to a year to see my body really start to change after that its so easy to just maintain and keep going please try this long term,NOT
we need to push bigger on vegan propaganda so only then we will be able to change hundreds of thousands years of meat eating habits to veganism,NOT
i feel like a drag queen maam its a job    go do it then,NOT

what people miss about the gender wage gap is that it doesnt exist,NOT

multiple personalities im actually fucking speechless,NOT
lol look at her new mukbang,NOT
let the trans compete against each other,ABU
hi trish i havent been vegan long its been about half a year but so far what has helped me is eating at least one really great starchy or carb filled meal a day like pasta vegan pizza or potatoes something like that it makes you feel so great and energized and wont send you into like a funk eat a variety beans different colors of veg and fruit so you get all the nutrients you need and thats how you actually feel great dont feel pressured to need to fit a vegan structure like raw or hclf in the beginning it is easiest to just start by eating vegan foods that you like just so you dont feel as restricted in the beginning especially for these  weeks la is so great for vegan foods i live in china and it is way harder here p good luck,NOT
please try not to go into it too fast like start out by cutting out one thing and finding a good substitute and so one im honestly sooo happy that you decided to try veganism out  and remember eat until you are satisfied ,NOT
shut the fuck up this what equality is,ABU
jesus how stupid can we get,NOT
where i work we are required to use some equipment that is a bit heavy all the female employees refuse to use it and pass it off to the males to use we male employees as gentlemen dont argue and just do the job both the male and females are paid the same now where would anyone argue that these female employees actually do deserve to be paid the same when they refuse performing part of a job because they physically cannot do something or just refuse to do something if anything making men do something the females are allowed to refuse is discriminating towards men,NOT
okay im already grumpy and im  minutes in how are middle aged men still believing that veganism is so wrong im a meat eater myself and know for a fact that veganism is the healthiest and most ethical way to live it only takes an hour of research to understand that,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that it doesnt exist at all,NOT
men likes to work longer than women i have to disagree while making overtime while my male comrades are already gone even their shift didnt ended its just bullcrap that most women arent willing to work longer as much as men are willing to do overtime when someone mentions overtime its always the males who complains at first and that they need higher loan for working more while we women just accept that the situation requires it and just do it and often even ask for it although theres actually no reason for it at least thats how it was in the last  companies ive worked it got multiple times fired because i was too expensive bc of my will to work more funny i know,NOT
my family keeps trying to make me think the gap is real i keep telling them this and the only thing they have to defend themselves is no its real,NOT
now this is a smart chick,NOT
intrusion they choose to be female and god created to be male you took what was your personal decision and want to bully people in all areas in their lives to accommodate you people dont like being bully you will meet resistance ,NOT
being vegan helps a bit with weight but freelee always cycles that why her bod is so thin i would recommend getting on a bike too if you want to loose weight hope this helps trish,NOT
this video was definitely made a few weeks ago and judging by your latest vlog you didnt stick with the vegan lifestyle,NOT
try veggie burgers and drink lots of water i know u dont really like veggies but kale and other veggies have protein,NOT
this seems to only pay attention to white women white women get  cents for a mans dollar black women get  cents and latina women get  cents if your feminism isnt intersectional you aint doing it right,NOT
im gonna start playing womens basketball and get a d scholarship,NOT
what the actual fuck is she trying to say  girl are you trying to get yourself canceled youre making the trans community look so bad ,NOT
trisha you and freelee are both so beautiful theres no reason to compare yourself,NOT
girl im not vegan but i know about dieting and fitness you gotta eat those beans lentils and nuts for a little more protein in your diet definitely look up some vegan recipes good luck i hope everything works out,NOT
remember last time you told someone they werent trans then made an apology video,NOT
coughwage gap is not real cough  cough,NOT
this is all set up for the people who really run this world they strategically put these young boys as transgenders to see if they could get away with it to see how much backlash they are going to get from this because it is all fake especially the parents look fake the number one thing is track for the parent what about these are boys they are not girls their boys i dont care what they do they will always and forever be a boy sorry but im not sorry cuz that is the way that god made them so they need to go run on the track with the boys and dressed like girls and run with them,ABU
there is an enforced wage gap at my company men start at  more than woman no matter what,NOT
wage gap for attack helicopters go,NOT
what would yall do if she went to doctors and whatnot and got diagnosed with real gender dysphoria,NOT
hurray we are so progressive,NOT
the gender wage gap is fake wemon and men do work for different jobs that pay differently on top of the fact that sexism is an opinion and everyone is entitled to an opinion if your boss is paying you less than your coworkers then do something about it instead if complaining about it the wage gap is quite simply wemon who look at a small fraction of a problem and blows it out of proportion,NOT
stop supporting her people she is disgusting i watched her video to see who she is  she started eaiting enormous amounts of food chicken fingers and food i dont even know what it is freelee stop supporting her  everyone can say i am going vegan  stay vegan for a while then say i am going vegan  what a stupid chick she is and so fat i cant look at her yuck who can eat that much shocking,ABU
just put them against guys until they cant hold their own,ABU
they should compete against men they are not girls they are boys,NOT
i hate that i doubt this  i hope its real,NOT
a woman debunked the myth,NOT
d yes you can do this there is still vegan junk food you can have and even chocolate if you love chocolate but if you want to lose weight the best thing is staying off the meat and dairycheese those do make people gain weight im excited for you,NOT
why the fuck am i crying,NOT
yesyesyes stop killing our planet,NOT
and yes its fair theyre excluded they need to race with men because when they get full rides to good colleges off of a unfair advantage its excluding the actual females that came in  and  places potentially out fucking rageous,ABU
fantastic you we have come so far in three years thank you for being the change,NOT
these are the alternative facts folks seems legit,NOT
also try meat supplements gardein is amazing honestly ive never had good experience with vegan cheeses but try everything,NOT
so happy trish well done girl d,NOT
um girls can just be attracted to gay men men are attracted and admire lesbians girl just love yourself and get help please,NOT
could you believe my mom makes less money than justin bieber absolutely disgusting sexism,NOT
why cant they just run with the boys its not fair it has nothing to do with genders,ABU
just always look at the ingredients on foods you might be surprised to find out what foods are vegan original pringles are vegan so snack away also rice milk is the best alternative to milk in my opinion ,NOT
why are people freaking out about plants they have no blood,NOT
in essence blames childrearing with the assessment that women do most of the work there with men slacking doesnt sound like news to me also doesnt sound correct sounds more like a basic explanation that appeals to those who believe in traditional male and female roles based upon a male dominated society where women are tasked with taking care of the kids,NOT
officially convinced shes loosing it,NOT
i can see how in some cases its unfair and unreasonable for there to be a gap however there are other reasons for it reasons im not gonna write an essay for but lets say alimony that seemingly only men get stuck with or in a good majority where the man is the main bred winner and the wife is doing it as a way for a few extra  or a way to get out of the house it can be similar to how a single mom gets special social treatment vs a single dad ie the mom needs money to help get a car fixed the sympathy is real but when a single dad needs to get money for a car he tends to be left to his own devices but hey im a white male millennial and we are apparently the problem to some people so what do i know,NOT
yay trish this is awesome,NOT
ik she is in the wrong but there is some part of her that is dealing with coming out in a way so we shouldnt come for her,NOT
she isnt considering all factors very unreliable source,NOT
so its not a wage gap its just different life choices atleast they actually tried to explain why its happening compared to other feminists,NOT
ahhhh this vid made me so happy,NOT
if youre going to include unpaid working hours then why not include as pay the cost of chocolate and flowers that woman get on valentines day and her birthday the cost of the vacation trips her man takes her on the cost of the movie tickets and popcorn her share of the restaurant bill and entertainment her share of rent or the mortgage utilities the engagement ring the wedding that some man paid for and her share of the income tax that he ends up paying and the child support that she uses to buy new dress and shoes the health and life insurance that he pays and how about the social security and life insurance payments she will receive and everything she will inherit just because she married a man now you know why men dont live as long as women,ABU
toned but not gross thin,NOT
there is no wage gap,NOT
i find it interesting that the college majors that women seem to gravitate toward in larger numbers are those that are highly useful in motherhood  nurturing children  aiding in family stability ,NOT
actually masculinity is a natural part of being male and femininity is a natural part of being a woman its pretty deep,NOT
is it crack,NOT
as a gay trans guy she isbig yikes i wont be able to satisfy myself or my partner like luv eye,NOT
this wont last,NOT
the reason this is gross is because it takes opportunities from girls that are busting their asses,ABU
oooooor its because women and men choose different careers and choose different actions in life jk its not like america is a free country or anything,NOT
attention dumb asses hormone therapy changes the the level of testosterone in the body hormone therapy also includes testosterone blockers which prevents testosterone from working inside of the body a transgendered woman could very well have the same strength and speed as a biological woman,NOT
its amazing it took so much time and effort but it finally payed congrats freelee ,NOT
all the porns gotten to her head,ABU
theyre still boys i can identify as a giraffe all i want to but i will never be one,ABU
i used to subscribe to this channel,NOT
im sorry but i cant stand her voice ,NOT
can anyone send me a link to sources that prove this i need them for an english paper,NOT
try intermittent fasting and do videos about it ,NOT
so basically youre choosing to be trans you dont have dysphoria you dont have it diagnosed but you feel like a man and a woman boo thats being genderfluid,NOT
the thumbnail disturbed me that banana was broken ,NOT
can people just stop pretending like biology doesnt exist if youre born a male nothing can change that,ABU
are you insane min preroll add how is this even something that slipped through,NOT
trishaaa we are so proud of you i recommend you to eat as much as you want if its healthy vegan food all the fruits and veggies and to eat a mediumlarge amount of pasta you can eat rice and potatoes as much as you want either but be careful with the amount of pasta if you are not working out oh and you made a good choice buying vegan food keep eating clean i dont recommend you to consume junk vegan food more than a couple times a week if you wanna lose weight congratulations and keep going ,NOT
being trans is about brain chemistry not brain thoughts ,NOT
if you cant work the extra hours of course you wont make as much im glad harvard is devoting researchers to something we already know,NOT
it is unfair,NOT
after this speech i wouldnt mind her earning more than me at the same job modest women need to be rewarded i mean this conceptually not literally,NOT
now we have to debunk the wage gap for the other  genders,NOT
meat substitute products are not the answer they do not offer the same nutrients please note i am not working at all for the meat industry i just want to point out that animal protein is closer than vegetable protein to human protein animal protein is thus absolutely essential because it is much better assimilated than vegetable protein even when combining legumes and cereals you can be vegetarian and healthy provided you eat eggs and dairy but definitely not vegan deficiencies will appear sooner or later i have heard plenty of testimonies by exvegans who described the same symptoms general weakening intense pains in the muscles tooth cavities bloating it is all very nice to care about animals but we must care about human health as well,NOT
fun fact wage gap doesnt exist,NOT
trish one thing that could help your new vegan lifestyle could be going on walks i know one thing is i joined a cross country team in th grade i used to run a  min mile but now i run a  min mile walking is a great step to running running has so so so many good things about it anybody can do it no matter the size cause i know i wasnt the skinniest in cross country it can also improve your mood and lastly it is a very effective way to be healthy i know that if you do want to work on this and be able to continue it you have to start slow and be patient i know that i never was near the front even when i was improved but that doesnt matter what matters is that your time improved if you do want to start this activity i recommend first walking maybe half a mile every day for about  days then you try to runjog a full mile i remember running my mile for the first time i would stop every  mins probably one way to gain back energy but not stop and take a rest is just by slowing down even if you have to walk to gain energy back your still going somewhere and continuing anyway if you do want to do this practice walking then you need to try your hardest to runjog a mile when doing the mile you need to have a timer going when you are done with your mile and have your mile time write it down somewhere you will always see it and then when you go on more runs you can easily figure out how fast youve gotten how long it would probably be to go an extra distance i also recomenned getting a certain type watch fitbit orsomething like it or getting a app on your phone one thing that gets me motivated to run is getting new running gear i recommend not ordering online the prettiest one by a over the top brand but instead find a local running gear store near you and get you walk checked and feet checked to find the perfect shoe for your feet that will help so much i hope you get to see this advice love you blndsundollmj,NOT
gabi stopped becoming vegan,NOT
can you make a video about pewdiepie roasting sorsha thanks ,NOT
if you do your research youll find that the government passed a bill that states that no woman can be paid less than a man working the same job and the same position working the same hours so next time you make a video discriminating against men do some research,NOT
i saw a video of pigs being abused and slaughtered and i couldnt eat meat for  months i wasnt even really vegan i just got sick thinking about eating meat crazy,NOT
how to actually end the wage gap stop pretending to be a victim by it go for a stemlaw related major or high demanding trade and promote organizations to help change young girls mind who want to or interested in from the stereotypical jobs for women,NOT
women asked for this ,NOT
so according to the comments we either live in a perfect society where every single person is hardwired to treat everyone in the exact same respectful way or we live in a society where we have a male dominant entity that hates women and makes employers pay women less nevermind facts and details nope facts dont matter one side must be the unquestionable truth and research doesnt matter unless it contains a catchphrase that vaguely backs the agenda i support,NOT
men work themselves until theyre mentally and physically sick men will work at the expense of their relationships and family and friends men will earn money by dishonest or immoral practices but if we change the culture women can do this to i bet you cant wait to teach your daughter these things yay for equality,NOT
vox is just a leftwing propaganda machine,NOT
there is no wage gap,NOT
as a malesbian i find offense offensive,NOT
me knows you identify as a trans gay male because youre attracted to gay guys my friends omg she came out shes so brave i stan,NOT
i hate cancel culture but this year old year old needs to be canceled,NOT
you would think that if the gender pay gap was nationwide discrimination preachers of it would be able to point out numerous individual instances of discrimination after all you cant have a true generalization without sample members fitting in with the general statement look up the gender pay gap for basically any other country than america its still there that suggests it has more to do with worldwide culture and less to do with the us being a sexist patriarchy,NOT
i feel with all of the backlash its going to make people anxious about coming out and figuring out who they are i dont agree with everything trish said i think she has alot of soul searching to do but i also do not agree with all of the hate she is getting and i do not believe that it is our place to tell someone who they are or arent,NOT
you to girl im so happy for you  i hope youll thrive on this lifestyle please make your usual meals vegan like chicken wrap make vegan chicken wrap la its heaven for vegan there are somany restaurants also you can make rice potatoes sweet potatoes lentils tofu veggies chickpeas fruits fake meats fake cheeeses please watch vegan what i ate in a day videos also please go to just vegan group on facebook dont restrict your calories  i wish you all best,NOT
soooooo it seems transgender men are breaking every womens world record winning every event they participate in and beating the all women they compete withdoesnt that seem like proof enough,NOT
i officially hate trisha for this blaire you gained another fan im buying your merch youre genuine as hell fuck trisha,ABU
plan your meals in advance cook stirfrys pastas veggie burgers and salads with fresh veggies one day and put them in your fridge for throughout the week ill be real cooking can be a pain if your coming horn from work and you have to cook a meal from scratch but its so easy to just grab it out if your fridge and put it in the microwave  also i always look up restaurants before i go out and see what vegan options they have there so i can suggest where we go or i dont get to a restaurant and realize i only have a side salad to eat,NOT
thats funny she didnt go over any of the occupations where women earn more than men like modeling waitressing stripping hooking,NOT
comparing salaries for people who earn over  cry me a river,NOT
this makes me want to try a vegan diet too its a bit scary but i want to try it,NOT
this channel is sponsored by the zionist israel aipac biggest israel lobby in america to favour israel intrest before america  dont take my words search there videos regarding israel and found out for yourself  america is controlled by the zionist jews ,NOT
sike bitch lmfaoooo trish trolled you lmfaoooo,ABU
the argument that feminists are making is that they want equal pay so that means that in their eyes a female social worker should earn the same as a male eco consultant reminds me of somethingcommunism,NOT
what about the women who work the same amount of time at the same job providing the same services as their fellow male colleagues and still get paid less i dont understand how that would be based on choice or effort its also not myth or fake news correct me if im wrong but the market is still sexist,NOT
been waiting all year for thisyes ,NOT
perhaps the answer isnt so much more flexible hours but rather that men be more involved in their childrens lives,NOT
a females body isnt built for speed and strength like a males body to mix the  genders together is asking for the females to be tossed to the side,ABU
what a beauty tears just dont stop after reading the comments dreams coming true ,NOT
lol youre showing these graphs of how much chores men and women do and how much time they spend with the kids that stuff is so biased those arent things you can measure those statistics were probably aquired by asking women their opinions on how much their husbands help around of course itd be low,NOT
love this amazing work,NOT
act like you dont know freelee,NOT
you can eat as much as you wantof whole plant foods not cooked in oil,NOT
i think that these parents are just salty that there kids lost the race,NOT
the moment you put a joke like greta in the video this little clip lost all credibility and value,NOT
women at my work get more hours than i do and make a dollar more,NOT
should be  i identifies as scruffy,NOT
i swear she also came out as a chicken nugget once lmaoo,NOT
freelee this sure answers all the people who hated on you for seeking her out in the first place im happt for trish and you both congratulations,NOT
i like how its a woman saying the wage gap is a myth,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap what people miss about the gender wage gap is that it is not a wage gap instead it is earnings gap yeah i know  minor correction s,NOT
there is a spending gap however,NOT
i feel like a transgender female to male but also like a drag queen that sounds like being a woman with extra steps,NOT
so your last argument after taking in variables it will vanish to almost nothing is that without any study or verification you are just implying that it will vanish that is blatant hypocrisy you know first you manipulate data and say women just take lower paying job by enforcing sexist values throughout families and then you just assume what the hell is that you yourself said that it shrinks down to  to  peecent why not a zero percent you just assume that small wage gap is not important lets do a fun maths game if every american male earns  dollar for hour and a woman is paid  percent less taking your generous average then she is just paid  dollars now that  dollars might not seems much but then it gives a decent fast food meal to fill your stomach once and that is important to many lower classes now if you multiply the hours worked by both the genders by  hours approx a five day  to  work week it compounds to  dollars and then if you multiply it to  week month that is  hoursthen the wage compounds to  dollars now that is a lot okay that is enough to make you survive comfortably in a middle class home for at least a week now it seems you are bad at maths not just the corporations and yeah i might have forgotten to take some data points into account,NOT
its easy for a woman to earn as much as the men in her field she just has to work as hard and as many hours as them and deliver the same results in most cases to achieve and sustain this may imply not having children,NOT
as much as i think trisha is a nut case and no i personally dont think she is trans but we cannot put all transgender people in the same box that there is only one way that is works that everyone must feels the same way in their journey etc if there was a step by step to how it works it would be a hell of alot easier for people struggling we cannot tell people how they feel we never know what people are truly feeling or going through as much as trish is talking rubbish in my opinion we still dont know about the demons she fight inside herself which is what we all deal with at different levels every day no im not a fan of trish at all but people go through sht and i think we need to be sensitive to it,NOT
she looks like shes in her late s yikes spf is important folks it doesnt matter if youre  every one needs it,ABU
the rise of the vegans,NOT
im will to bet trish only did that to purposely stir up drama i mean thats how she gets paid right,NOT
i stopped wearing make up a year ago so have i been a man for the past year my bf and i might need to have a talk,NOT
yay im so happy i cant wait for trishs before and after pics,NOT
are you ever going to address what you did to vegancheetahs channel,NOT
might as well make steroid usage legal in sports,NOT
i have no idea if you are going to see this but i have been vegan for  weeks and its because of you i have stomach problems and since i became vegan i started to love and understand animals more my stomach doesnt hurt i am losing weight and have never felt so good and healthy,NOT
lol no lie this is hilarious lets see if all this equality talk without common sense and honesty applied has a positive effect in my opinion hell no they boys they have an advantage and all who advocate for these people dont have to compete or take a punch to the face from them,ABU
jokes aside if shes being serious this is pretty much a prime example of what terfs think all trans men are people who went through some shit because theyre women and think that disliking sexism and performing peak femininity makes them a literal man rather than a normal woman lol her constant talking about uncomfortable experiences and liking gay men more than straight men because they wont objectify her or treat her poorly and her literally saying herself she has penis envy makes it glaringly obvious shes not dysphoric shes just a woman who hates todays gender roles and standards which again is normal terfs are gonna be aaaaalll over this shit going see tra cult is kidnapping our vulnerable wombyn,NOT
omg so happy your doing this,NOT
now im thinking about international economics like outsourcing for reduced cost where a country is labor intensive,NOT
every vegan i know looks sickly and hungry kevin smith went vegan after his heart attack im happy for him and hes lost all the weight but now he looks  years older i respect your lifestyle but its not for me i eat very little red meat but i love chicken so im keeping that,ABU
save our daughters,NOT
i am so happy for trisha amazing trisha your a hero,NOT
ok one thing straight you are not transif you are trans or feel trans you dont have glam nails you dont wear female clothes  look her profile pics but she agrees that she is the  the gender she was assigned at birth it doesnt have logic,NOT
you should really talk to kallel she has been a vegan for sooo many years,NOT
and yet  week ago she ate mcdonalds plus she eats eggs so nice vegan start,NOT
so heres the real question how come as a society we value the work that women do less than what men do sexism thats the answer,NOT
imagine earning  dollars and still complain that u earn less than men,NOT
i wish i was as creative as trish ,NOT
do a live talk with trisha you would be a better therapist than what she currently has,NOT
when even vox is not parroting feminazi bullshit,ABU
what got bleeped at ,NOT
the homophobia is what makes the chicken taste good,ABU
awww so glad to hear you are going vegan btw a great side snack that is also healthy is grapes that are dipped in yogurt and then frozen,NOT
all the beta males are gonna identify as girls so they can finally win all the time lol,NOT
ive pretended to be a guy online since i was  ive been an adult for years now but that doesnt mean im transgender i also dont wear makeup or do things that are considered girly can i not be a girl and just do whatever i feel like doing with my bodymind do i have to shave wear makeup high heels dresses and talk like a preppy cali girl to convince people im female how you act and dress doesnt determine anything i dont act like a girl online because girls get too much attention too many guys talk to me if i give myself a girl name andor picture its annoying im not going to call myself trans though thats so fucking stupid transtrenders are annoying attention seekers trisha just wants the views and  very obvious as usual,ABU
so is she trying to say shes gender fluid and likes drag ,NOT
this is a joke and makes a mockery of athletics,NOT
people are talking about it now so she succeeded,NOT
damn right sista,NOT
follow your heart bible says the heart is deceiving lol i think this every time someone says follow your heart,NOT
i never knew you had a cat also yea shes not trans lmao,NOT
so you said masculinity and femininity are not genders but then you say so inject testosterone and cut your hair to prove youre dealing with dysphoria alrighti usually stand by everything you say  but this just confuses me,NOT
also vegetarian is a good transition option cause it can be hard to just drop all meat and cheese,NOT
wow just wow,NOT
get our lord and savior milo in here to teach everyone about the wage gap,NOT
that was my first reason to go vegan animal abuse the ignorance of a culture have us eating another creatures with a nerve system like us and remember fish is not a veggie lol to many advices and options online also a page where they deliver to your door the grocery and meals i am vegan and gluten free you do lose weight and also will be healthier animals are not part of our diets we are not carnivore we do not have the right teeth to eat meat and our digestive system does do well with meat shop rite grocery store have lots of fake frozen meat and burgers lol i do not like them because they do taste like meat and after a while you just do not tolerate the flavor neither be bless ,NOT
trisha looks like a battletoad,NOT
they couldnt beat the boys so these two went with the next best thing wear a wig and race against the girls pathetic,ABU
the moment i saw this i thought freelee finally got to her haha,NOT
can someone give me studies that counter this the actual study reports not media or blogs note this is an actual request,NOT
omg i love you for doing this,NOT
damn yall americans are crazy yall cant be serious,NOT
no way wont even last the week,NOT
im sorry trish ive been a subscriber for a while now and i really like you but i think this is the most ridiculous video youve ever made and i think its safe to say when it comes to things like this you have no idea what youre talking about youre just having identity issues you are not trans,NOT
how is vox still a thing,NOT
everyone who thinks this myth is true needs to see this video from start to end,NOT
also props to their parents cause they progressive af,NOT
why do not all companies employees be women because their salaries are lower,NOT
yeah like serial killers are just processing people not slaughtering them,NOT
chick fil a,NOT
change how we produce food exactly factoring farming cafos enormous monocultures petrochemical fertilizers are the problem you can ethically produce meat in a way that creates a carbon sink some meat eaters are your friends the ones that support ethical meat producing practices we should join forces to stop big agribusiness the monsantos and the tysons of the world,NOT
ill tell you what i learned from being vegan for  years im eating meat now because my b was heading towards the danger zone dont let that deter you though i just sucked at being vegan lol as much as i took pride in making the food i was still a pretty lazy chef and was very uncreative when it came to eating out but these were the good bits   the best time to eat melon is either at the start of your day or when you havent eaten in a fair while as melons have a pretty high water content and will run into anything ingested before it  when i was trying i beat a lot of unhealthy food cravings by studying the contents of each thing identifying what part of the food it was that i was craving and then substituting the unhealthy thing for a healthy option chocolate craving was magnesium fast food craving was usually fat and would be replaced with an avocado nuts or whatever  i couldnt afford vegan cheese so veg pizza with whatev i could find to add flavour was a staple,NOT
whichever side youre on we might as well just pass a law so that everyone no matter what gender race sexuality they haveare working in the same field gets payed the same,NOT
read the china study girl ,NOT
the amount of time she moves her hands is the same amount of stupid energy from this video,NOT
there is waaay more to it than even shown here basically the gender wage gap is not a myth its a damn lie,NOT
fuck u vegan bitch i go spearfishing and hunting i eat meat,ABU
use the recipes on forksoverknivescom theyre delicious and easy to make and of course vegan,NOT
i work for myself so i dont care be an entrepreneur and none of this matters,NOT
someone should show this to swedish politician gudrun schyman,NOT
ive seen alot of comments giving you food advice and im probably repeating alot of them but definitely eat alot of the whole simple foods beanskidney black refried lentils etc oats like oatmeal for breakfast try overnight oats they are the bomb with some frozen berries mixed in the morning of smoothies are good snacks i see alot of vegans eat a smoothie only as a meal like breakfast or lunch but that doesnt feel me up so i have like a green smoothie with my lunch or like a fruit smoothie with my lunch or as a snack any time in the day when im hungry you can make them even more sweet with some sugar cane juice or coconut sugar salads are good but make them more than just a basic salad i like to turn my salads into like burrito bowls so rice beans tomotas guacamole corn salsa green onionsetc like up on pinterest simple easy vegan meals and you will find alot of ideas please remember that it is hard for everyone at first especially for the ppl just doing it for the aesthetics so remember the other reasons why you are going vegan like for the animals and also for your overall health on the inside not what you look like on the outside ,NOT
vicky vox aint got no time for this,NOT
but check her last video i mean like same trisha i think i wouldnt be able to go vegan either like maybe i would eat healthier and eat less meat but i still would eat meat if you havent watched her last video she did another mukbang plus since she made that video if you follow her on sc she still eats meat and dairy,NOT
hey girl if you need any help lmk i live in la and would love to help u make the transition ,NOT
you didnt even mention race and ethnicity those affect the gap too,NOT
soooo unfair theyre boys not girls,ABU
ima start a business of just women and pay women  less profits will be booming,NOT
if they feel they are really earning it and feel they are not cheating guess this comes with the change and acceptance  we are all gonna have to deal some changes in making the world equal,NOT
thank you vox,NOT
seriously please eat lots of bread rice pasta potatoes and watch the weight fall off,NOT
this probably wont get seen but trisha i can relate ive always felt more comfortable around men have always had more male friends than female have always been told i have a strong masculine energy and ive always thought my personality wouldve been better in a mans body i dont believe these factors make someone transgender they are absolutely real and valid feelings but i think you are still trisha youre just moulding that person into who you think others want her to be you need to be you regardless of what is between your legs,NOT
i found out about the gender wage gap when i heard bernie sanders harping about how awful the situation had become for women i went to his website to read up on the topic i found only bullet points so i was forced to do my own research to see how such an injustice had continued to occur it took me about  minutes to find out that bernie sanders was a socialist windbag who cared more about votes than doing what was right any politician any politician who tries to use this bs wage gap number to push their agenda should be bound gagged and flogged were talking about national policy and the highest political offices in our country there is no place for this kind of bs when something so important is at stake,NOT
sounds like someone doesnt understand gender,NOT
there is no gender wage gap the gender wage gap is  cents ,NOT
the example she showed with the  cuisines people and man and a woman i think straight off the bat thye should earn the same wages there was a  dollar gap in the beginning of their careers,NOT
been vegan almost two months now and ive never felt better in my life the new taste of food the power and energy and most important  lack of stomach ache is everything go vegan now you wont regret it,NOT
i always thought women got paid more than men at least in my industry they do,NOT
wow she really filmed and edited,NOT
oreos are vegan ,NOT
sooo what you are saying is that actually women are stupid and take all the wrong decisions or or wait you are saying that there is a gene in the y chromosome that allows men only to work long hours without notice really is there a study to prove such a thing or you just thought of it and if this is the case after all and lets say that all the gender wage gab is created by choices why women feel compelled to make choices like these is society driving them is it the fact that they are the only humans that can actually reproduce the species or maybe we should change that lets stop reproducing since it all boils down to choices because being the only one capable of giving birth is a choice sure thing and by the way call your mother and inform her that as a woman she is not willing to work long hours without notice i am sure she will have a few things to say about that good day,ABU
i cant believe half the ads on tv etc are meat and dairy products and that corporate slave who calls himself a journalist murdcohs cock puppet whats his name who crawls to serve the meat industry yeah,NOT
i am so sorry insert actress name in the oscars  if the rock gets paid more that you it might be because he fast and furious is worth  times mote than your last stupid film oh and wait you still have like  million dollars,NOT
do you know how retarded you sound throughout the entire  minute video i was unfortunate enough to have watched i dont give a shit what people want to be or whatever but the whole i can be different on any chosen day thing is absolute horseshit and you know it your views are dwindling and this stunt is not only stupid but a complete waste of everyones time,ABU

mental disorders being supported as fairness smh,ABU
keto blogger the very configuration of our teeth shows that we did not evolve as carnivorous our canines are rounded the molars larger than carnivorous thats all about how food is processed in our mouth the fact that food is gulped today is contrary to the feature of chewing the food to mix with the digestive fluids and only then swallow the fact that its not done today does not validate appalling habits everything that animals go through from birth before being gulped by humans is reflected in the ensuing result  obesity digestive problems cancers anger fear pain overdose antibiotics contaminated grains which flow in to us nature provides us with everything we need to eat and cure us everything bible punching creeps hide behind god to justify our disgraceful actions the planet is reeling our lack of civilization is at war with progress which is also running rampant ai which the great majority ignore is at our doorstep this present social disorder is not serving or protecting us ask yourselves if corporations will use them they in turn will not pay taxes so why must we pay taxes why must we pay for irrational wars why must we pay for ai who will take us over i mention all this because it all comes down to the vagrancies of the rich animals are the mana for the food industry which is killing us and damaging the planet the food revolution takes us back to basics health sanity compassion ethics love this will help save us we need to upgrade our civilization status food is our sanity and health thank you greta thank you all who are galvanizing a needed change more and more is needed humankind must step up sans elites,NOT

whats there times  cause some boys slow anyways in track lol,ABU
you know what people keep focusing on the different pay for the same job thing but theyre missing a bigger picture men in america im not sure about elsewhere can drop out of high school join a union where they get paid while they train get full benefits and really good wages they can learn these trades from their dad uncle anyone really while they grow up and have a job that pays them really well right at the start of their life my dad knows how to do all kinds of skilled trades but if i tried to ask him what he working on hed say i was in his light and tell me to go play hes teaching my little brother about fixing cars of course and im glad when i graduated i got a job as a housekeeper at days inn i was paid based on the number of rooms i was assigned to clean and given  minutes to clean them after that times up im working for free i made  an hour and worked my ass off but made at most  a week working full time then i got job after job making  at the most womens work doesnt pay well it just doesnt so i thought i wanna make money like the guys do ill work hard im not scared of labor and went to school for welding turns out i loved it looooved it i loved every part of my job in and of itself however i didnt love the harassment and bullying i had to deal with i wasnt walking in with a pink helmet and crying girl power or anything ridiculous i wore  sports bras a jumpsuit and made a point to be polite to everyone i crossed paths with while keeping to myself and staying out of any nonsense it turns out even if i keep to myself and try to not start any drama when youre the only woman in a building with over  men someone some jerk will have a problem with you based solely on the fact they think you shouldnt be there that one jerk will multiply quickly then you find the guys you thought were your friends coming up and telling you i hate whats happening to you its not right youre a hard worker and you do a great job but i just want you to know that ill never defend you youll be gone eventually theyll make sure of it and ill be the next target if i do point is they say well women can do those jobs now too if they want to and while thats true and not every womans experience it was for me im not talking about being flirted with either i can handle that i had a manger from a department that was totally unrelated to mine slamming his breaks in front of me on the highway and trying to drive me into a wall over and over leaving work one day i didnt even know who it was or why it was happening until the next day when i saw him get out of the same car no road rage cutting anyone off riding anyones ass type of thing thats just one example out of many i can give forget about the unequal pay for the same job part wheres the union with paid training for womens work i mean it sounds almost stupid to say out loud but wheres the cleaners union or the secretaries union or whatever job women are supposedly naturally good at the other day i paid a guy  to hook up my internet he was  hours late it took him  minutes i gave him a beer and a taco to go home with he seriously showed up at  pm i cleaned someones house the other day for  the lady had  small children she homeschooled and the house was a disaster i felt bad for her and wound up spending most of my money on suppliesgas and it took  hours to clean it was a waste of time honestly but no one seems to think anything of paying women basically nothing when they hire them but pay an electrician or plumber astronomically more money thats the problem no one questions that when women were originally allowed to work they typically had husbands that made the money and the women just supplemented the income so it wasnt a big deal to pay women less but were still living on that base model today and people arent getting married after high school now im  and single and take care of myself its not like that anymore,NOT
this video brought a tear of happiness to my eyes finally someone stating the truth and calling out those who dont and providing evidence so nobody can debunk it prager you just become my favorite company ever cheers to you lads keep on doing what you do godspeed,NOT
highly recommend getting some transitional vegan options like gardein vegan chicken veggie burgers thinks like that you can also get vegan cheeses and great vegan milk alternatives i know you like eggs for breakfast so you can even try this new thing that you can get at whole foods called vegan egg or make a egg scramble but with tofu instead of eggs of course keep in a lot of fruit and try different ways to have veggies but dont forget rice and good carbs,NOT
well heres a conundrumwhich womens rights should the libs be for in this case,NOT
way more honest than the other wage gap vdeo of yours and better putted together way to go,NOT
its an obvious advantage  we need to stop protecting peoples feelings by hiding truth  facts are facts people  if your born with a dick your a man born with pussy a woman  there are people with both i think this argument of competition for them is more valid these are guys with make up on nothin more n nothin wrong with that either how ever when you start to force your beliefs impose your will on other people its wrong and when people expect to be respected for there way of life you must also accept that it goes both ways and you must respect that they feel and or know different  true freedom of self expression is respect for others views,ABU
im sure it wont last long lol plus your mukbang videos will suck but proud of you for making a healthier choice for your body,NOT
sean baker looks terrible,NOT

the  figure for unexplained gender wage gap determined by the aau is cherrypicked for starting salary the gender wage gap grows to  by the time people are in their mids,NOT
i love a gd rack of ribs followed by a glass of fresh milk,NOT
so basically the wage gap which is really an earnings gap exists because of the careers men and women pursue and the number of hours worked i dont see where this is a problem if women decide to work as many hours and pursue the exact same careers as men do theyd be earning the same if this was a true wage gap which insinuates that for equal work men and women get paid unequally all businesses would hire women over men cutting their employment costs,NOT
failing to account for gender hiring bias,NOT
as soon as i see the fake ball i click away,NOT
this is  a trolling video,NOT

flexible hours alone wont be the solution but a part of it essentially it would help if men would take the same responsibility for their children otherwise childcare will always remain a woman problem,NOT
my female high school ap statistics teacher once and a couple other times told us its not men who oppress women in the workplace but other women women are so jealouscompetitive with each other that they would bring down other women so that they can get ahead its an interesting thought to say the least of course im not generalizing for the entire population but its another perspective to consider,NOT
please make a video for us straight cis folks what all the terms mean,NOT

so basically wage gap is a myth created by incompetent researchers and propagated by feminazis ,NOT
i am applying to a job but i checked to see what it paid first the problem is that it says compensation is  hourly but is that the male or female wage why do companies only post one wage like this and not even specify what sex it applies to,NOT
the top  richest people in america are men these men would highly inflate the wage gap,NOT
wooooomen power i say men are lame because men are smelly and sexiest im raped everyday yesterday some man came up to me and said heyi like you and i was wondering if you wanted to go on a date ugggghh so disgustingg womenpower,ABU

i better stay out od west hollywood i dont want to confuse anyone,NOT
if everyone went vegan then the demand for vegan based food would rise unfortunately vegan based food does not last all year due to seasonal changes so food has to be sourced from other regions of the planet in the meantime large acres of cleared land will sit dormant in the colder seasons awaiting a warmer climate before crops can begin growing again the price of food will rise significantly due to the capitalists control of the markets being vegan isnt going to save the planet deforestation is the leading cause of climate change which will continue to expand as global capitalism takes control what you eat is irrelevant,NOT
i can in expecting third wave feminist professional victim garbage but i was pleasantly surprised by the actual facts and good arguments the biggest argument i have against the wage gap though is that if employers could pay women  less than men they would only hire women,NOT
gigi being a total sweetheart though,NOT
the logical conclusion of the wake movement everyone must identify as trans or be outed as transphobic,NOT
men often get degrees based on job availability and pay men then seek jobs in the career field they studied in men are more likely to ask for higher pay men tend to stay at the same company for longer men stay in the same career field for longer men work more hours men take less time off men are more likely to relocate for a job men are more likely to convince their spouse to support their career all of these factors increase mens pay to represent the current wage gap that gap should not be closed by government mandate,NOT
your gender is t just own it and be how you wanna be lol,NOT
obama thinks they are girls these people should not be allowed to compete against girls,NOT
she needs to learn more about the lgbtq community and stop faking shit,NOT

this reminds me of when my older brother thought he would be good at wrestling because he could beat up on his younger brother in essence these people need to compete with someone their own size,NOT
this is a good option for food refried beans rice mixed organic greens and vegan sour cream you can mix it with more refried beans to make a dip you can make a wrap out of it you can make a salid all you do is heat up the refried beans and rice for a minute in the microwave and mix as you like,NOT

i think shes just stupid and confused to be honest,ABU
there is not a gender wage gap it is a federal crime to discriminate against people based on their sex there is a gender earnings gap which closes to almost nil when one accounts for types and concentrations of education and time invested into careers but lets look at it this way if women are paid less than men for the same amount of work why in the world would anyone ever hire a man when they could get an equal amount of work out of a woman for  of the cost,NOT

i call bs on  women were making  less is incorrect k is actually  of k which means women were making  less on the other hand im wondering if the numbers were simply very badly made up k is exactly  more than k exactly the odds that numbers come out that precise in statistics from random studies involving dollar amounts from many people are incredibly low so either the numbers are made up or they are very grossly rounded that said ill give them the benefit of the doubt and say they dont understand simple math they saw k is  more than k and assumed the reverse phrasing would be correct two is  more than one but one is only  less than two,NOT

it literally says in this video that the  c wage gap still exists after accounting for all choices she killed her own argument and then just ignores it by saying the key word here is choice,NOT
shes always looking for attention and she loves to make everything about her i dont hate her but i dont understand how people like that kind of content ,NOT

you are so much fun to watch you have a new sub ,NOT
i think she confused gender roles with biological sex so doesnt realize that you can be nonbinary xd having gender disphoria is a lot different then not wanting to conform to a gender role or not wanting to identify as any gender at all,NOT
at least they decided to shave for the interview,NOT

yeah she is gooing crazy i think she is bipoler,NOT
i mean once she identified as a chicken nugget so,NOT
i think that woman got less and still in many places get less wages cause there is a certain mindset that women dont have as much as the caliber as a man also woman come with a load of baggage as in child care which is alone too much for a business to handle that is why women are not chosen for jobs everytime it is practical for men to be chosen for businesses but this neglects woman who want to work the system is filled with holes maybe the problem is not present in your region but nothing in the world is regional we can find many cases of wage gap in many places i dont believe im a toxic feminist or anything so if you want to argue let us do it politely,NOT
you use the f word so much its lost meaning,NOT
shes not trans shes stupid and has no problem starting shit for views i will never watch her anymore i cant believe in two days she has manages to put down trans gender and mental health she thinks being  or baker act means she knows it allmore over she needs to be reminded many younger watch her channel and she sending wrong message ,NOT

also you can get a frapp with soy or coconut milk at most places,NOT
those images at  dont say women do more than men to raise kids in two parent households they show that equal plus father does moretogether  outweighs mother does more  so in  of households the father is doing the same or more than the mother of course when you say mom does more  vs dad does more  it looks like dads do x less work and if you run the graphics by quickly and say that out loud while you do it adds even more to the misleading nature the only category of the three presented where mom does more is taking care of sick kid mom  equal  dad does more   is greater than  thats hardly a shocking indictment of fathers everywhere then you have to make the leap from those numbers to pay when it isnt clear how that would directly translate into earnings of someone  years out of business school,NOT
the kitchen floor the chick filla this video was just everything,NOT
yes those calculations dont show education work or choice but there is data including those factors the gender wage gap does exist and i have overwhelming data to prove it go to the economic policy institute,NOT

my favorite vegan recipe to make is veggie burritos theyre literally one of my favorite foods you just saute onions bell peppers and mushrooms roast some sweet potato you can use regular potatoes but i like the extra sweetness and corn and cook up some rice i like the make a huge batch of all of that and eat it throughout the week you just pile all that onto a tortilla with some salsa and avocado and its bomb kbye thanks eheheh,NOT

hell has frozen over ,NOT
lets imply pay gap is real for equal job quality and availability paying for men vs woman work is just unfair if thats true why anyone would like to hire man they could get same job done for lower cost,NOT
lmfao in the feminist quest for equality they are allowing males to dominate not only their own category but also the female category,NOT
i remember sometime last year one of my female classmates complained about the wage gap to which i said you along with  of university students in this building are art students if you want to tilt the scales get out and stop being a visual arts student the only way women can tilt the scales if they leave the humanities and peruse more demanding careers most of them in that art building arent even good artists anyways waste of money for them,NOT
even  isnt good enough its gotta be ,NOT
sorry about the negativityeven if trish fatass becomes a vegan she will never abstain from fatty shitty food thus she will still be the same fat blob and she wont influence any of her fans to become vegan,ABU
amazing how so many kids who are whining about feminists in the comments didnt even manage to understand the video vox didnt say that the wage gap was nonexistent they explained why it exists and what needs to be done to tackle it,NOT
she already lost bc she ate meet l,NOT
trisha really tried it ,NOT
who knew the gender which evolved to be as useful and competitive as possible turned out good at doing stuff and working hard weird right,NOT
yay st time you show your cat ,NOT
this makes a lot of sense my mom is an attorney which means hours are flexible and can be done whenever as long as they are completed at her firm you can see how much everyone makes and shes always made as much or more than male counterparts so ive never really believed in the gender wage gap,NOT
what vox missed it isnt a pay gap  thats been against the law since  its an earnings gap because people make different choices most women want to have children  its hardwired into our species are you suggesting that they shouldnt they also want to raise their kids and tend to select careers that allow them to do so are you suggesting that they shouldnt men work more hours work more overtime accept more dangerous and nasty jobs and are more willing to travel away from home for work if women want to earn more theres nothing stopping them all they have to do is spend more time working most seem to want more balance between work and family and that is absolutely fine but the you can have it all indoctrination promulgated by certain activists is pure absurdist fantasy nobody can have it all you have to prioritize and juggle,NOT
feminists defending the wage gap is like fundamentalist christians defending the existence of their god they shift the goal post so much and expect us to believe that has always been their argument god of the gaps talk wage gap of the gaps,NOT
this is so fucking toxic and harmful for actual trans individuals stop claiming to be a part of communities because youre bored that week jfc,NOT
trish my advice would be to eat many meals a day to increase your metabolism and to eat a lot of fruit for your digestion,NOT
 years now vegan,NOT
try a no oil diet for not gaining any weight and loosing weight stick to raw foods mainly,NOT
need alot more food then that or youre defiantly going to cheat get strawberries cauliflower rice beans potatoes lettuce avacodoguac the options are endless or even gardein fake meats for transitioning,NOT
ellen has super good vegan tips and recipes on her website,NOT
basic things you can eat are pasta with read sauce rice and beansif its refried get vegetarian kind its vegan maybe even with tortillas and salsa veggie sandwiches etc you could try substitutes but some are really not good for you also make sure to get your fruits and veggies in the most good luck,NOT
the wage gap is fake look it up,NOT
not to be that guy but the infographic at  is misleading in that it equates the wage gap recalculated to  cents to the  cents that is the previously mentioned female median wage not the wage gap which in that case would be  cents did i miss something there or is it just an accident,NOT
this is pure bullshit and wrong sick of this crap,ABU
so the key to closing the wage gap is to make more flexible hours that would be great for everyone so you can plan your own schedule to fit your specific needs gotta get to the root of the problem rather than just seeing the surface,NOT
its so disgusting that you would use the lgbtq community for entertainment on youtube,NOT
trisha can suck a big cockwhich she previously was paid for as a hooker ,ABU
you go girl,NOT
can we please start labeling this entire topic lifetime earnings gap so we can save some suffering and confusion maybe then we can actually start figuring out how to compensate people in unquantifiable work aka sharing and caring jobs,NOT
so i have a dilemma im a young trans guy i have not medicly transitioned yet though i plan to but thats beside the point theres this guy i like and he dosent know im a guy but he keeps flirting with me in my th hour class and thats about the only time i see him so i dont know how to tell him im a trans guy like what do i say how do i bring that up in a conversation and if i do what if hes not gay or what if he is and he dosent want to date me cause im not cis like i sreriously need so advice,NOT

wage gap is a myth,NOT
i did see this story on the news when it was one now two this is the biggest piece of bs period completely unfair they are not girls and never will be all girls should protest sports is being ruined by this crap enough with the political correctness feel bad for the young people today that feel pressured into thinking this is normal it is not,ABU

wheres the femenist community to fight for equal rights what a hypocrisy,NOT
try researching the term demigirl i think thats what shes trying to explain,NOT
k a year out of college is high for the average profession,NOT
uhh no the facts you showed actually revealed that the male dominance of the high paying jobs which happens because the society and our culture encourage boys about having such job a lot more than girls creating the wage gapno its not because boys are better at stem the science itself already proved that girls are just as good as boys at math and science and etc also since our businesses were run by mostly males since the beginning of the word business the culture actually is more fit to men which also is the big reason of the wage gap women are discriminated just look at the facts,NOT
give them a uterus transplant and make them run with cramps then ill consider this being ok,ABU
 yes it is fair for real women,ABU
freelee ive just seena really openhearted positive genuine version of you nice to see you not resenting or feeling negatively xx,NOT
im trans ftm im not offended just concerned that she isnt  educated i dont know this video is so much i wanna cry  laugh but i want to talk to her trisha please talk to me idk i need to talk to you i wish i could have a conversation with her about this,NOT
well if it really dosnt matter why cant they transition to being a girl but still compete against boys but i guess that defeats the points of trying to feel special,ABU
the intro hahahaha,NOT
no no no no you fuc show me a specific job where women are payed less cause they are women and i will agree but missinterpreting graphs according to your own appeal just to show how everything is unfair wont do the trick,ABU
wtf thats a big difference in pay,NOT
i think if they make jobs flexible itll make people lazy i mean hey might as well not go into work at all if you have a good enough excuse right womans just gotsta learn to hire baby sitters or trust theys kids,NOT
thats pretty incredible considering the tense relationship the two had a few months prior to their facetoface meet up regardless of her true intentions the attempt speaks volumes,NOT
   sexism maybe    alright    so theres some bias right there you made the bar say  cents when it should have said  cents or you could have made the bar say  cents and then say  cents im willing to forgive it but bias is something one shouldnt forget about    thats one way to interpret it there is the idea that certain jobs are paid less because they are traditionally female and because women tend to gravitate towards them   may be thats the key term in that sentence    see this is where the interesting part is do those jobs pay less because theyre traditionally female the one job where women dominate men the second highest paying one i mean is still traditionally considered a male dominated job perhaps the pay for these jobs is low becuse theyre traditionally female  okay so men are overrepresented in dangerous jobs but women are overrepresented in jobs which help the social classes and keep the country turning and people in need happy men are overrepresented in business jobs which pay too much and contribute little enough to society that if a few went out of business it wouldnt really effect most people in a major way women should be paid more for jobs like pshychology education human services and social work which is essential to our society,NOT
she doesnt present herself as a male at all but yeah yeah ftm for sure,NOT
just run faster great tip,NOT
i know u can do this,NOT
number one thing people miss about the gender wage gap simple its not real,NOT
watch thriving on plants on youtube for day to day vegan recipe inspiration,NOT
shes just saying shes gender fluid not trans thats where shes confusing af,NOT
a lot more veggie then meet in my dietneed to figure out going vegan completely working on it,NOT
i dont think she understands what transgender  means,NOT
all feminist need to see this video as soon as possible so that they can stop pulling the bull shit wage gap card,NOT
youre kitchen looks so nice i love the pink lighting,NOT
wow is abc really gonna side with these disgusting perverts,ABU
women are not as good as men at the highly technical and engineering related roles that generally pay the most for most people the reason why they are not as good is probably because they are not as intereseted in those roles for all sorts of biological reaons even though most women who enter those roles then enter management or quit as opposed to most men who stay motivated on the technical side less women as a whole enter management because of the starting numbers so the gender pay gap is not a gender gap but a talent gap people who take career breaks for family reasons who are not as nerdyautistic and as a result achieve less and have less experience in short they are less valuable in the business world and thus are paid less people who are aggressive obsessed about their career position thick skinned enjoy being manipulative with borderline socipathic tendancies do well in powerful very high paying life dominating management positons can those traits be attributed to gender,NOT
kale chips are the best ,NOT
freelee you should link her video in the description box ,NOT
so exciting in tears of joy ,NOT

there was more than  vegans in the uk in  lol,NOT
hey trish you cant eat as much as you want on a vegan diet i think the point is that you dont have to restrict yourself eat until youre full a huge part of weight is in exercise you can eat a great diet but if you arent moving and using your body youre not going to get the results you want,NOT
gotta encourage young women to go into science and professional careers as much as men then hopefully there will be no gap barring the occasional sexist recruiter who thankfully have mostly died out i read about a study a while ago that found that women are more likely than men to not apply for a job if they dont meet all the criteria things like that are what needs to change,NOT
work same hours get same money,NOT
this is a wonderful video can we get it more views that any of stupid lacy greens videos,NOT
girl you cant eat as much as you want on a vegan diet xd youre still taking in calories and if you dont use them up they gonna turn into fat d,NOT

why do people still get their panties in a bunch over this its been debunked so many times,NOT
hang out with channon i think shes vegan she could give you advice and take u out to places like that one time,NOT
no matter how much they mutilate their bodies take test blockers and inject estrogen you are still physically and biologically male  that will never change how sciencemedicine has allowed these people to mutilate their bodies knowing full and well this is a form of body dysmorphic disorder is disgusting for exploiting these individuals and pushing this agenda,ABU
what about the age based wage gap older people make way more than younger people im sure its much larger than a  cents on the dollar difference how is this fair,NOT
thats so cool trish ,NOT
was she making fun of alinity at the end this is vodka btw,NOT
its hard to go  percent vegan im mostly vegan but dont check ingredients enough to assure allvegan,NOT
do i think im transgender yes a thousand percent do i identify with my birth gender yes it doesnt work that way,NOT
they said they feel welcome by the staff and other people thats because if anyone hurts their feelings they would be called racist and homophobic they would be shamed on national tv this is why so many kids are so confused and cant deal with reality most of us see the reality here but obviously they cant quit lying to our kids i feel bad for the girls competing against these boys but i also feel bad for the transgender girls its our fault,NOT
oh freely you did it again  like damn you always righttrish hated on you so much but she becoming vegan now ,NOT
for a sweet treat have vegan chocolate with any fruit yum,NOT
i saw my girl trisha post this video and ive been waiting for your response,NOT
you could also revert the first question why would businesses pay men more than women rather than pay why not put them just as low,NOT
so what do women want do they want men to subsidize them so they can work less and still earn the same sorry not gonna happen i work for my own living not anyone elses as it stands women already use and get more benefits from social services than men do even though men are the ones that pump more money into the system because they work more anyway im glad the feminist have finally accepted that their  cents for every dollar data is defective and incomplete they never would have accepted that before so this is progress,NOT
trisha didnt go vegan its a way to boost her channel,NOT
great video very succinct and informational allow to criticize one thing though i find ms summers reading too noticeable to my taste when she speaks i look into her eyes and i dont feel like shes looking back at me but rather reading a wide sign above my head there needs to be a topdown scrolling reading platform under the camera or something even more suitable i dont know the correct name for that but feel free to tell me i believe that would make the video even more professionallooking,NOT
you know i feel like the kitchen floor is the best place for emotional breakdowns i actually had one there i mean the kitchen is just sacred and holy,NOT
thank you lets not forget a women is simply not physically qualified to do a lot of jobs when was the last time a women showed up to roof your house not likely its proven a we are equals intellectually but obviously not physically sorry we evolved differently men just simply have more avenues for financial success but we still value a women as our equals becouse of there different qualities,ABU

these videos would be so much more useful if the camera were about  inches farther back ah well,NOT
you cant just say something doesnt count while youre on the diet because u will start saying that to urself and basically put urself in denial,NOT
men are far more likely to die on the job i say that worth  cents,NOT
trolling video is almost a month old,NOT
this is nuts lol,ABU
does me finding this hilarious make me a sociopath cause i do,NOT
what happened to gigi and trisha,NOT
dont take our community for your own fame were worth more than that,NOT
so whats the spewing about women and men do not get paid the same for same job same work same experience i dont see any backing evidence or examples of this when they start saying this stuff but obviously theyre making people think or believe it whoever they are,NOT
why not have an estrogen vs testosterone level test for these competitors before theyre allowed to compete its no different than when pro athletes are doping ie mark mcguire lance armstrong etc to gain a competitive edge over the competition have these transgender athletes submit to a test and once their estrogen vs testosterone levels are at a baseline consistent with the rest of the girls let em have at it,ABU
yes animal argiculture will shorten our instiction as well as transport industry ect with all respect to climate activists its truly hopeless,NOT
amazing thank you so much guys highly inspirational ive been sick for several years and never could quite get it to reverse my motivation and energy levels were seriously waining until now vegan  has rekindled my motivation and deeply moved something within me to get healthy again so i can serve as inspiration to others i feel as though i have been reenergized all i want is to feel good again then i can truly start serving our earth the animals and future generations through the vegan movement thank you,NOT
you can make a vegan burrito bowl throw in rice cilantro onions black beans peppers lime juice salsa and you can even have tortillas on the side its really filling and tastes good,NOT
wage gap doesnt exist you get paid by the hours and woman statistically take more leave than man woman are paid less because they take more leave and if they dont like then they should start a side hustle or a business or invest on stocks and real estate,NOT
so glad im vegan and will be for the rest of my life ,NOT
you you have no idea what being trans is do you,NOT
who are you,NOT
such a good video,NOT
hahaha last vid i saw she was eating fried chicken ,NOT
how about man take on the same number of household chores than woman that way they are both equally affected by nonflexible hours seems easier and more natural than forcing every job to a flexible schedule,NOT
i know this is a weird comparison but i just thought of it when watching this video when spiderman got his powers he said he could never compete in sports with his newfound powers since he wasnt able to compete before basically he knows he would be at an advantage but he still doesnt compete because he knows it would be unfair i dunno this video makes me think of what he said,NOT
hey trish some of my fave vegan foods are vegan brownies you can either get the recipe on google or you can buy them in stores sometimes bean curdtofu  try the marinated tofu or you can get awesome chinese meals with bean curd often sweet chillisweet and sour sauce try spicy bean burgers too theyre filling and imo taste better than some fake meat options i also love vegan bacon but ive been veggie for a long time so it might take a while for you to adjust to overall try meals filled with rice cous cous or quinoa they keep you full and incorporate lots of flavours into your diet like soy chilli etc im definitely not an expert but ive been veggie my whole life so hopefully you might find one of these ideas interesting love you mama trish   ps sorry for all the parenthesis in this comment lmao,NOT
shes gonna gain more weight lawl n it wont last,NOT
stop having kids with shitty men then they can share the bearing of the kids equally and neither have to sacrifice their jobs,NOT
yay go trish honestly ignore the hate comments i think you can do it and you should go for it,NOT
mba grads do not make k on average,NOT
definitely eat more substantial foods besides fruit to keep you full for longer and give you more protein and fiber like beans lentilswhole grainsquinoa brown rice oatmeal sprouted whole grain bread and also veggies you need veggies to be more satisfied because of the high vitamins and minerals found in them definitley gave your greens if they are hard for you to eat throw them in a fruit smoothie spinach is great in smoothies because you cant taste it at all try to like saut or steam veggies like broccoli green beans asparagus honestly any veggies you like once you start eating the little by little your taste buds will adapt and you will eventually start really like vegetables also hummus is really good to dip veggies in  i hope this helps and i hope to see you sustain this lifestyle and incorporate more fruits and veggies in your everyday life love you trish,NOT
yay finally the truth i get tired of hearing that wage gap myth women dont have much more to fight for anymore and we should be grateful for that,NOT
freelees positive videos make me want to eat cleaner but her negative videos almost have the reverse effect on me,NOT
your thoughts below,NOT
feminism is a myth,NOT
he will donate to every vegan to shut up vegans wont shut up and vegans are aggressive because we speak on behalf of voiceless defenseless animals if it was for me im mostly a quiet person who doesnt like attention but its a moral application to scream for them because they are confined behind closed door out of sight somebody has to do it moron if its not you because youre a lazy selfish selfindulgent asshole at least be happy that someone does,ABU
how proud are u that she already devoured a pizza on her snapchat from dominos,NOT
maybe it would help you loose weight i know people go vegan as a diet,NOT
i identify as a gay man and a dragqueen  your sexual attraction has nothing to do with your gender  you can not identify as a dragqueen being a dragqueen is a hobbyprofession and a great one i dont mean anything negative by that  being less typically feminine does not make you male being masculine and being male are two different things also being assertive is not being a man thats literally just being assertive,NOT
nope nope to all facts racism and sexism are the reason for everything in the world,NOT
trish paytas is a prime example of how a weakminded moron can be convinced of extremely high end bullshit easily in the future this sort of shit is going to be considered an alternate form of munchausens syndrome the only barrier to it now is that these stunning and brave gag moronsuhhh individuals are getting mainstream acceptance and the thing about that is it really isnt helping them any in fact its doing the opposite if someone wants to know how this works it is entirely possible for a parent to hate their child and at the same time smother them with appears to be love at the same time how does it happen shelter them from life dont let them grow up when a parent loves their child as if that child is their possession like an inanimate object thats going through the motions of love and doing bad things to their child in order to keep that child how they want that child to be to an unhealthy extreme or your child is unhappy and they tell you they just dont want to live anymore and you hand them the gun because its what they want after all i would argue that a hovering parent or a helicopter parent can actually be worse than a lackadaisical parent neither parent is giving their children direction in a proper fashion on one hand you have children who have no supervision no leadership and and direction leading that kid to seek other people for direction more often than not were talking the wrong kinds of influences here and to tell the truth most of them are the exact same way no parents being a parent on some level they know what they are doing is wrong or bad for them but that doesnt stop them from becoming psychopaths sociopaths drug addicts thieves gang members or any number of other types of criminals out there with a hovering parent the child is clearly in control and its the parents job to make sure nothing bad happenswhile this may generate fewer bad seeds in number these little fuckers are far worse than the other side because these little shits have their parents to cover their six when they start fucking up they have a mandate to be assholes and never have to deal with the consequences because the parents keep those little fuckers from ever experiencing consequences so their bad behavior starkly overshadows all but the worst of the children raised in lackadaisical environments,ABU
wait this was actually logical,NOT
oh god is she ok i feel a britney moment might be happening soon,NOT
watch mommytang shes a vegan youtuber and does mukbang and gives amazing recipes,NOT
if the wage gap exists why would any reasonable company hire men if women could do the same work for less the answer the gap doesnt exist,NOT
freelee probably took the memory card for trishs video,NOT
i feel bad for her she looks like she has some pretty serious issues this is what happens when being transgendered becomes a fad with lots of misinformation surrounding it people who are not in the best mental health glom onto that idea as an explanation for their problems and self diagnose instead of actually unraveling whats actually causing them mental distress i couldnt watch this trisha looks a mess and i dont think youtube fame or infamy is going to help her situation,NOT
trisha you going through it through it,NOT
when she mentioned freeleeyawn,NOT
they can be whoever they want no problems there however totally unfair to compete they need to get out or go against males period its total bullshit to compete against the girls end of facts,NOT
christina hoff sommers you are my new hero this is the face of real feminism a competent intelligent woman using real data and logic to demonstrate a point,NOT
with trishas logic every straight guy that is attracted to a lesbian is also a transsexual lesbian,NOT
it seems she maybe just jumped in too deep too quickly it only took a few days and shes just posted a video already of her eating multiple non vegan items also there seems to be a disconnect between a vegan diet and a vegan lifestyle i love that she tried or is trying but maybe baby steps would be more efficient and productive for her its easy to get overwhelmed and give up when you try for too much right out of the gate,NOT
xy xx cromizons determan what gender you are,NOT
its just common sense dammmmn,NOT
trisha im so damn proud of you if you want physical results its going to have to be for more than  weeks,NOT
when you do anything to get views,NOT
i saw women typing on typewriters and making food during the times men were in war yup thats definitely equal work but thats ok women arent built to work super hard thats the mens job,ABU
this video is old that outfit is from when she went to shanes movie premiere her nail polish is blue now and she was just eating at cheesecake factory not to long ago ,NOT
i think shes a flamboyant gamine which means shes a female with a higher yang balance but some features of yin like tina turner audrey hepburn and lady gaga im a guy whose almost the oppisite in body typing im a theatrical romantic so im a guy who has a higher yin female energylines balance examples being prince johnny depp and sure sometimes i feel way more fem especially around other men but that doesnt mean im trans or nothing like that i cant believe she really said  ,NOT
as someone who has studied labour economics and with some statistics training this is one incredibly hard question in both technical and philosophical level we need to distangle all the contributing factors to wage which is never a possible thing to do second labour market itself is distorted in so many ways and the pricing mechanism isnt just one orrange is just like another orange in other market we are pricing people here even assuming we are living in a perfect world that we can price every factor goes into the wage experience education is it morally just to pay women less for the factor like pregnancy maternity leave that can negatively affect the operation of a company,NOT
women worker  works less then fellow male worker male worker  works more then women worker takes less vacation and works over time also doesnt take days off to see child if he has one women  gets paid less man  gets more women  suprised pikachu also pay gap has been disapproved by a women  equal opportunity  equal outcome,NOT
its trisha if she was for real she would have said it in a video with shane dawson or would have had a break down afterwards shes trolling the haus,NOT
i guarantee this chick is still crushing mcdonalds breakfasts off camera,NOT
if this is real  somebody really doesnt understand what being transgender is by the way non binary yeah not a thing you can be a masculine woman or a feminine man but you cant be neither male or female just saying ,ABU
women work less then men as a whole group so when you take an average women make less then men because they work less as a group,NOT
hey was so proud they texted it for all the world to not see cause it wasint a mass message  such a joke,NOT
its millie vinilly,NOT
so can anybody recommend any vegan baking videos or recipes or even books  ive been a veggie for  years now since i was  but more recently i have been cutting out dairy products too and changed all my beauty products and all that stuff to natural cruelty free items i think that means im slowly converting i miss baking and could do with some yummy recipes to try cakes biscuits etc also i much prefer videos like these i find the swearing and stuff hard to watch i understand its coming from a place of passion but its nicer to hear much more positivity and encouraging words ,NOT
medical research cant identity the line where an advantage may present get the fuck out of here what a bold faced lie fake news but yet again,ABU
what is a crow mukbang ,NOT
what has the world come to men who think theyre women and its not their own fault cause its a mental disability the state is humoring this at the expense of the other real girls success,ABU
so many idiots the wage gap does exist however thats just a statistic women dont pick the same jobs as men therefore they get paid less posting comments saying the video is sexist are retarded so are the ironic comments saying it doesnt exist like jesus look at the dislikes its just a statistic,NOT
i really enjoy your content because compared to other transgender youtubers you come off as the most genuine and real really helped my transgender education and understanding develop,NOT
lets see how long trish last on vegan  thing,NOT
youre not vegan if your doing it for dietary reasons thats called a plant based diet not vegan vegan is a lifestyle i love you trish make sure to eat lots of beansnuts for protein and carb up do not be scared of carbs on a plant based diet there healthy carbs and also taco bell has a lot of vegan options just google them love your vids,NOT
another point to add assuming that the wage gap exist purely due to sexism means that you also have to assume that it is men and men only involved in the hiring process,NOT
love these educational videos please dont stop im not in school anymore so learning about these things are pretty neat,NOT
korean bbq is good oh wait wrong video,ABU
trisha your so close to losing my sub,NOT
isnt it also illegal to pay people differently based on sex arent female porn stars and models way better paid than men i mean there are no male supermodels,NOT
i am so proud of her d shanes turn lol,NOT
w h a t ,NOT
i wish i was fortunate like her and go vegan so i can afford it i dont know why she quit,NOT
now change your annoying voice,NOT
trish eat more foods earth balance butter replacement is great for toast and making grilled vegan cheese tofutti has great cheese slices that you can cook with also almond milk is great for coffee tea and cereal many cereals are vegan but be careful for gelatin in some eat pasta and rice grains nuts fruits veggies and potatoes two weeks may not make a difference for you it took me  months on a vegan diet to lose  pounds which is good considering it was  pounds a month  pounds a week good luck,NOT
trish all u said are personality traits enjoying glam stuff doesnt make you a girl or a boy its just you being you,NOT
yes this is incredible trisha two weeks is still wonderful you go girl love ya,NOT
ive been vegan for about two years and i can tell you from experience that you will lose weight if u eat lots of carbs  like  cals a day and exercise at a moderate intensity for about an hour a day  days a week your metabolism will slowly speed up and heal so to speak from the damage youve done to it by under eating and binging then u will experience weight loss and youll start to fell so much better in your own body,NOT
trish fans cant even come to support her at this now and if they are please go squeal in a corner this woman is fucking nuts and is confused with herself she really needs help finding herself and no one should be tolerating her whole lifestyle,NOT
i tried going vegan was only able to last only one week its so hard  i wasnt dedicated enough ,NOT
watch mommytangs mukbang videos for simple recipes,NOT
joey carbstrong has the best vegan name ,NOT
who tf is making a hundred grand right out of business school,NOT
ugh trenders you need dysphoria to be trans,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap is that it doesnt exist,NOT
vox you surprise me,NOT
its interesting how most of these antifeminists are by women,NOT
i went vegan in  after trying so hard to since  so disturbed about those carnivores and the ones eating squirrels raw ,NOT
i dont wanna judge but since i know theyre not gonna see it and it was bugging me for a long time im gonna say it i think my friend became a trans man because of his fetish for gay men even before he came out as a guy i would constantly see and hear him talk about all the gay guy he like however me as a lesbian cis woman whenever i wanted to talk about my crushes on girls he would stop listening to me or even say how gross and weird that is woman with a woman gross from supposedly gay guy wow,NOT
there is no wage gap,NOT
this is funny af  you just dont have to take trisha seriously ever,NOT
watch vegan what i eat in a day videos  you can do this trish,NOT
a guy with a penis competing against a girl without one sounds fair to me,ABU
lol for everyone who is saying she might be vegan since today she just posted a snap with pizza she is lying,ABU
so im a girl who is attracted to gay guys even though things would never work out lol does that make me transhell no,NOT
so you are pointing out how our culture teaches women that they cant or shouldnt be in technical majors and careers or leadership roles this is what leads to a lower median salary for women so we should work harder to let women know that are just as capable of engineering and technical work instead of pushing them out of these historically male dominated fields,NOT
 i think what you mean is that instade of a  cents gap we have a  cents gap then you shouldnt show this bar going from  to  but form  to ,NOT
does anyone have the link to these studies contradicts other data ive found so far so would greatly appreciate,NOT
as a trans guy this video is more than incredibly offensive this is worse for the lgbt community than actual hate videos as her target audience will be roped into believing this bullshit the fact that she said you can choose what gender you are really made me feel an anger i hadnt felt if i had the choice i wouldnt be trans i dont think she realises how hard this journey is,NOT
this is how many brain cells i lost watching this video ,NOT
this is fucking stupid abc news the world is going down the shithole i support the lgbt community but this is going too far now,NOT
cherry picking at its finest,NOT
of course they dominatedthey are males and its not fair,ABU
we all know she is trolling but i find it very strange and funny that the same group of people telling us we have to believe them that they are what they say they are are making videos bullying her not you blaire im talking about the liberal trans community with  labels per person,NOT
this entire argument is based on an equation that makes no sense i mean all full time workers in the us and you already stated that men go for the higher paying jobs and women favor lower ones thats like me setting up this bullshit with the guys and girls at my office then shockingly the girls make more because the owner is a women try getting data from people in the same field with the same level of experience and then well talk,NOT
im so excited for this gonna go full fanboysoyboy,NOT
whoop whoop im so fkn happy,NOT
so ur gender fluid,NOT
love this reaction this is why i love freelee she may come off strong at first but its due to passion and i love how supportive she is of everyone who is making the effort to go vegan so inspiring,NOT
this is going to last as long as your relationships,NOT
of you look at overall averageof all jobs and all degrees men make more money than women because there are fewer women in higher paying jobs but if a man and a woman work the same job same shift and have the same degree work in the same stateprovincecity state and are equal in job positionex manager and manager they will have the same pay,NOT
i honestly dont care because i aint about to give my salary away the same i dont expect them,NOT
freele is going to love this video,NOT
many liberals understand the truth they are the ones selling the lie they know that adjusting or politically equalizing the money is a lot easier than equalizing the choices or the work it just moves the money away from those making the less attractive choices over to those who take the easier path want to know how long that works out go visit greece,NOT
feminists can all step on lego,NOT
im smiling so hard omg,NOT
you are very brave for sharing this it may not make sense to a lot but you make tons of sense girl you are very aware of the fine details in your emotions love you so much girl,NOT
well when an african female who just has too much testosterone is constantly targeted by the iaaf for an unfair advantage then having two blokes with tits is definitely unfair,NOT
when i was in high school my health teacher made us watch those videos so sad,NOT
literally there is no such thing as the wage gap,NOT
so proud of you trish i think its awesome that youre doing this,NOT
animals eat animals plants eat animals animals eat plants humans eat plants humans and animals animals eat humans and they are all living things plant lives matter human lives matter animals lives matter so we should just all stop eating and curl up and die,NOT
freelee more good news cara delevingne is trying to go veg,NOT
big clap to this amazing woman  thanks for this excellent vid prager u,NOT
vegans are basically just a more annoying version of nazis,ABU
is this video old and prefilmed cause korean bbq isnt vegan girl,NOT
hahahah i love it the stupidity of the left comes full circle,NOT
freelee i feel like i just have to tell you even though ive never even spoken to you before but i officially finally went vegan after a year of finding excuses such as i live with my parents and they buy so many nonvegan products and blablabla and at my school they barely have vegan options and i never like them so i would always say that i do want to be vegan and that i will be eventually but that at the moment it just wasnt possible but a few months ago i started watching your videos more seriously and frequently and focusing on your message and i realised how beautiful and noble and humble you are i didnt see that before i would see you as a radical mean vegan and it hit me how blind i was because youre the farthest from mean youre willing to have a mass of people hating you to try to save the animals and thats just incredibly selfless and i started seeing you and what you stand for as incredibly admirable and when people were commenting negative comments,NOT
i dont agree with they i dont want to identify as multiple personalities ,NOT
i mean trisha could be bigender,NOT
i as a man am furious the gender pay gap is real and it effects us all scarlett johansson made  million dollars this is just not right i only made  i am outraged by this horrific statistic and clear assault on my gender im not an actor and i dont particularly work hard but thats not the point she made millions and me basically poverty im two bad financial decisions from being homeless and all because im a man i cant wait for the pendulum to swing back my way and give me my just due,NOT
really great video quick thought i feel like to voice a right wing opinion to the left we must use a member of a minority to make the statements lest they write the opinions off by calling said speaker a racist or sexist for instance to speak out against feminism it must be a woman or the points will be written of on the basis that the person speaking is a sexist also for a right wing opinion on race to be discussed it must be a nonwhite person doing the discussion to avoid the points being ignored because the person making them is perceived as a racist just an observation,NOT
yayyyy there are nice an chill vegans out there too also if you wanna look like freelee try to remain plant based with occasional processed vegan foods like on the weekends or something i fell into the pitfall of oh i can eat that its vegan but i ended up gaining weight from that now i just stay carbed up pasta potatoes rice fruits veg and also you should follow high carb hannah also you will have wayyy less cravings making cheating almost unnecessary,NOT
did freelee beg you to make this video as her recent criminal activities has come to publics eye if yes then stop supporting a criminal,NOT
this gave me a better understanding of the topic i didnt believe the wage gap made that much of a difference because it really does depend on the job occupation you chose it is understandable why a women would get paid less since he jobs women chose are much safer than the jobs that men do men are capable of doing much more than women in a physical manner it is not sexist its just how people were made in the video it explained that if you do the math the wage gap only depends on your occupation and the amount came out to  cents women tend to stick to jobs like counseling social work and education these jobs are considered the worst paying majors the highest paying majors are careers like engineering and science based which men have a high percentage employed in these fields i agree with the videos argument the wage gap is more of a myth and that it is all based on your career options its not to often you see a women working a very laborous and dangerous job its a mans job because they are able to put up with certain jobs better than women,NOT
business school isnt looking too bad,NOT
yes trish babe ,NOT
i dont really believe gender wage gap is real never had a job with a girl that we both had the same job and we were paid different,NOT
although you know that you can eat as many calories as you want its extremely important that you do eat much more on the plantbased than you would on a diet including meat or dairy when i first switched to a plantbased diet i was eating just as regularly as i was while eating meat and dairy i was craving those things because they are so filling and i was frustrated however all of my cravings disappeared when i started eating more plantbased foods just a pointer for if you ever go through the same thing im so proud of you trish ,NOT
i dont mind transgenders but i do mind stupid transgenders just like i dont mind people but i do mind stupid people,NOT
thats nice and all buttrish is the most unstable person ive seen so i give her about a week to give up,NOT
i gave up dairy and still have acne my acne is mostly hormonal but ive known peoples skin to clear up completely ,NOT
there was a bacon add before this video xd,NOT
i dont know why people still disagree with the pay gap when we have clear facts and evidence of it not existing and shame on those politicians celebrities etc for claiming it does exist so they get public favor,NOT
im watching this at costco eating cheap food and youre reactions are making me laugh out loud,NOT
do i identify with my natural born sex  do i beleive im transgender  uhmthats not how that face palm,NOT

what is that trish thing,NOT
the media has bought the television comapanies a long time ago and the keto people cant argue their point because theyre not selling anything the vegan companies are always selling something kellogs for instance and averything thats had everything thats got b added to it is being advertized as vegan all sugar free items you can add vegan to any junk food and call it vegan as long as theres no meat product to it and you stupid people will buy it in abundance,NOT
 of all work place deaths are men,NOT
im a straight woman that only wears makeup and glams up on special occasions but this doesnt make me trans it does make me a normal female wtf is wrong with this woman is there a trans community making phone calls to crazy bitches,ABU
though fruits are definitely healthy and good for you they contain sugar and some are higher in sugar than others i remember grapes being one of them i think you need to be careful of the amount of fruits you eat good luck with the diet ,NOT
will you do video on khole kardashian is she vegan,NOT
conservatives rejoice you have forced corporate new media to report a neutral wage gap story that isnt completely flawed,NOT
morning protein shakes with soy milk is great and also look up vegan for starbucks for coffee also most cereal is vegan already so just soy milk will help with breakfast and stir fry veggies are so fucking good also french fries are great for snacking  and peanut butter is good for protein as well,NOT
trisha check out vegan diets here on yt theyre amazing step by step meals,NOT
im exactly the same with freelee with the fact of animal slaughter,NOT
wage gap doesnt exist man work more hours just that i am tired of explaining this to women,NOT
wage gap in st world country exists companies hire all women so they spend less money stonks,NOT
how come it always changes from c to the  c to the  etc wtf,NOT
my advice is just to eat alot as much as you could possibly eat the main backlash against veganism is feelingmalnourished when its just them not eating enough,NOT
teenagersthey havent even figured themselves out yet and the parents are sitting there going along with ityour job as parents is to guide and direct them,NOT
love your content blaire you are awesome for stating the truth and not giving any fcks,NOT
theres a little bit of a misstatement at   men make  more than women when you compare the ratio of one value to another the primaryoriginalbase value  that is the one being compared to  always goes on the bottom of the ratio so while men at k do make  more than women at k women at k actually make  less than men at k or stated conversely those women make  of what the men make written out women compared to men is  for men compared to women its ,NOT
strangely today i also i decided to go vegan go trish,NOT
remember that freelee exercises a lot everyday to burn off all that fructose,NOT
killing animals is sad we can do better for animals and the planet by going vegan,NOT
im so envious of your chickfila  ive been on a military base in germany for a year and the withdrawal is real,NOT
i feel like a woman can i join the womens mma im not gonna fight the pros i just wanna beat up some amateur bitches this makes its ok right wtf was obama thinking smh,ABU
this can be a debate only if you never heard of sexual dimorphism go back to school abc news work on your imagined scientific literacy btw will the narrative change when the first man who feels like a woman murders an actual woman in a cage fight he said he felt like a woman but the fight still had the distinct air of domestic violence,NOT
hmm maybe people want meatdairy substitutes because people actually need meatdairy,NOT
freeleewhere have you been we miss u,NOT
let the feminists and the lgbts argue with each other,NOT
the centsonthedollar statistic is calculated by dividing the median earnings of all women working fulltime by the median earnings of all men working fulltime in other words if the average income of all men is say  dollars a year and the average annual income of all women is say  dollars that would mean that women earn  cents for every dollar a man earns  divided by  equals  but these calculations dont reveal a gender wage injustice because it doesnt take into account occupation position education or hours worked per week even a study by the american association of university women a feminist organization shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to only  cents when you factor in different choices men and women make and the key word here is choice the small wage gap that does exist has nothing to do with paying women less let alone with sexism it has to do with differences in individual career choices that men and women make,NOT
sorry but this makes no sense i cant be the only one who has no idea what she is saying,NOT
so there is a gender wage gap by  to  this video implies that men are more hardworking than women and wage discrimination is due to this occurring keep in mind though that the department of labour concluded that this margin is not explained so there is a contradiction in this video,NOT
her accent is so annoying,NOT
meat is the best food source for humans high in protein iron and vit b omega s natural food sourcenon of this man made so called fake beyond meat impossible burger made in a lab no wonder vegans look like shit,ABU
appreciate what you do sister would back you up anytime you go giiiiiiirrrrrlll,NOT
im trans because i like pink  have penis envy  whatever reason really by that logic traps  crossdressers wouldnt exist theyd just be trans people that go back and forth between male and female depending on what clothes they wear ,NOT

men are ten times as likely to be injured or killed on the job that  cents we earn it,ABU
you should identify as a moron right now i cannot with you how dare you use your privilege to act this way your mental illness is palpable right now and you should be ashamed of yourself for all of this,ABU
waiting for freelees video now happy for you trish ,NOT
yes the wage gap seems real and this video makes a good explanation that the women usually spend more time on the children thus they would get less money for work with specific hours but i dont get how this is that big of a problem as some people make it out to be when most women with children also have a husband who can use that extra money he makes to support the whole family,NOT
hello blair since you said you read all of the comments have a pleasant day,NOT
i say its time for the government to implement a no gender left behind program communists have such a destructive perception of equality,NOT
vegan foods for beginners chia seeds beans quinoa greens more greens greens spanish celery cucumbers coconut bananas strawberries corn carbs galore you will need it almond milk herbs trish please make sure you are intact with your health requirements just because youre going vegan doesnt mean you get to cut back on how much you eat it affects what you eat not how much,NOT
yeah i definitely agree that freelee should be nicer and more approachable i dont even like her and i have been a vegetarian for like  years she doesnt inspire me to want to become vegan people like kalel for instance do that way more her body is beautiful but to be honest i think trishs body is beautiful too,NOT
gay dudes take care of themselves like women do pause every gay dude ive known of dress clean pause juat sayin lol riley from boondocks nia you gay,NOT
sooooo what you are saying is that men are more flexible with regards to their working hours and that when a job demands flexibility people who are flexible are rewarded men are flexible for work women want flexibility from work how could that gap ever be closed ultimately should it even be,NOT

check out a youtube channel called the vegan corner makes all kinds of vegan friendly dishes like lasagna brownies curry tortillas cinnabons etcyou are definitely going to want to make at least one meal instead of eating just strictly fruits and vegetables all day thats usually what i do i snack all day on fruits and veggies and make a vegan friendly meal during the part of the day where i have the most time also youre gonna hear a lot about smashing carbs and calories dont do that when youre starting out eat as much as youd like but dont overeat to the point where youre too full that will just make you end up feeling kind of sick i have binging problems i just feel like sometimes i have a void that i need to fill so veganism is great for me because i can literally just eat and eat and not gain any weight from it those baby carrots are great for binging if you ever have an urge same with celery apples anything that requires a good amount of chewing dont be afraid to use some peanutbutter or humus with some of those things too the great thing about being vegan is you can eat two or three times the amount of salad and itll make up one little cheeseburger from mcdonalds speaking of burgers try some veggie burgers trader joes has pretty good ones or you could look up recommendations online even when i was a meat eater i still preferred them over an actual beef burger and dont think that just because youre vegan means you cant eat junk food you can still eat chips oreos fritos nutter butters poptarts etc just google if vegan friendly foods and you should get a huge list also continue researching on veganism in your free time you really do so much good to the world just by doing that one simple thing of choosing something different to eat for your dinner its kind of like recycling you feel like it doesnt do much but when you join a group of people whos goal is the same it has a bigger effect than you think hope veganism goes well for you,NOT

hey freelee love your channel and you spreading the vegan message i was wondering if you could do a video on maddi bragg shes a young youtuber and has a large fan base  million followers on instagram mostly of young girls like herself she has been promoting the use of animal products and in her latest vlog she has even been supporting zoos it would really be great if you can open her and her fan bases eyes to the cruelty,NOT
this is actually well done considering vox did it ultimately youve shown that more women need to pick better jobs and better education seriously why is is always in business business or nursing and its because of flexibility however heres the thing vox youve also shown that there is nothing wrong with an earnings gap if women want to take care of the kids fine its their choice some men are stay at home dads and that number has increased for a few years now if couples decide to have traditional households with women as the caretaker and home maker or if they want to swap roles thats totally their choice whatever the couple decides is their choice and there isnt any reason to persuade women to do anything other than pursue whatever they want to pursue,NOT
the way society is going this will be the norm soon america is weakening by leftists ideology fucking shame,NOT
this is comparing apples with pears of course there is a gap between career choices and the imbalance of gender in these careers is based on early age internalized gender roles but also careers in science for example make it almost impossible for women to unite family and career ambitions that is why many women step out at an early stage of their career but its because of sexist circumstance not choice this video is not doing a service to this issue,NOT
just shut up and be a man and compete with other biological males,ABU

freelee you are so incredibly rude to people you do not deserve the fame and success you get you only recieve views because you have clickbait titles that hurt everyone else your big message is dont hurt animals but guess what humans are animals too and by calling people fat and ugly you could be directly causing humans to self harm or even go to the extent of killing themselves you either need to change or get off of youtube because the negativity needs to end now please thumbs up this comment to get freelee to see it,ABU
 if claudia goldin is such a good researcher how come she thinks that the entirety of jobs performed in society can be reduced to three categories business tech and science seems like shes trying to cherry pick the date to fit her conclusion doesnt it,NOT

alright i completely support transgenders and feel they should be treated with whatever gender they identify with however they still have the unfair physical advantage that all guys have over girls and thats why it isnt fair for them to be competing against girls who literally dont stand a chance physically against them its just unfair in my opinion,NOT
im a conservative and i dont like greta thumberg however if she brought svringe to justice or slipped something into his raw meat i would absolutely support her  nohbody has the right to go vegan purposely do it wrong so you get fake malnourished and eat raw animals in public its not veganism that almost killed you its your shitty planned diet that almost killed you and probably should have,ABU
let me get this straight im not she wants to go through the entire process to become a male just so she can dress up as a female im not hating or anything im just very confused on her thought process,NOT
i do think youre transgender and as well as a handsome young men and transwomen are sexist men smh misogynistic pieces of shit who like to praise caitlyn jenner and sam smith who are still men but trisha you are more men then they are  love you,NOT

watermelon squats baby,NOT
this literally sounds like the most extreme version of i have guy friends bc theyre less drama the societal stigma of what is feminine and masculine is bs just because your personality is not the typical idea of female does not make you trans this just kinda makes a joke of actual trans people that are going through it bc of bs judgements fucks i also like doing my makeup sometimes i also get alone better with boys its also true that assertive woman are called bitches bc we arent men but these things dont make you transgender,NOT
i want to cry i love you guys thank you ,NOT
im smiling so hard because holy shit yas trisha slay me,NOT
human beings dont accept change easily sadly in this video it shows one group battling against the other group just like republicans and democrats people will eat meat until the end of time i guarantee it and youll never change their minds even though they have to take a handful of pills daily  as a result of their views lets all live peacefully as one and each have our own ways of eating,NOT
you can have coconut almond soy rice oat  hemp milk my favorite is vanilla almond milk,NOT

potatoes can be made  put with so many different things honestly  you will never get tired of potatoes oh and noodles ,NOT
guys this is an old video and trisha is eating animal products in her social media this is a troll or a promo for freelee freelee probably paid her to do this promo,NOT
i love you so much more now that you are vegan     ,NOT
it is definitely a good thing you are going vegan i would suggest that you eat plenty of carbs and many different types of hole plant food beans pasta legumes fruits vegetables and there is vegan goodies as well there are many different ways to go vegan also i would include cooked food just know it takes time and do your best and find what works for you and will keep you vegan for life you can never eat too much have fun enjoy your journey,NOT
this is probably my favourite video youve ever made,NOT
darn it there goes my plan of starting a business that only hires women to minimize upkeep by a huge amount,NOT
and the irony in all of this is people who fight to end inequalities in society whether or not theyre feminists tend to come from courses such as gender studies community organizing human studies and psychology meaning theyre more likely to be less scientifically literate im not saying that to mean feminists are dumb or dont want to put in the effort but analyzing and understanding quantitative data is almost by definition harder than coming up with speculative social theories and running with those,NOT
hey trish dietary pointers from a vegetarian of  years and a vegan of   beans beans beans are high in fiber essential proteins other nutrients like iron and amazingly low in calories there are a wide variety of beans the most recognizable probably being chickpeas used in hummus and kidney beans despite having a poorer stigma kidney beans are absolutely delectable prepared right i actually have images of kidney bean tacos on my ig  lehind  anyway be sure to explore the beans there is inevitably going to be at least one that you find enjoyable  nuts though high in calories nuts supply essential fatty acids walnuts are known to boost neuron activity in the brain for example  pasta eat pasta pasta is extremely high in protein and caloric it is a grain of course buying a pasta with the least amount of ingredients displayed on the side is recommended the simpler the healthier will facilitate finding a dairyfree product as well also a note glutenfree pasta is actually calorically lighter than regular pasta i dont require glutenfree products but i enjoy the taste of glutenfree pasta  for dairy free cheese products and the like look at brands like earth balance daiya and all the others search dairy free cheeses and dairy free milks on google theres a wide array of milks for example all differing in taste and consistency soy milk almond milk cashew milk pea milk hazelnut milk oat milk flax milk rice milk hemp milk etc  commercial sweets i know of to be coincidentally vegan are vanilla oreos nutter butters etc look that up too mainstream vegan sweets  products or even vegan junk food obviously best in moderation  most chips are vegan,NOT
go trish youre health is priceless,NOT
wage gap is real you people always conveniently leave out why things happen instead relying entirely on that things are happening,NOT
some of my fave vegan foods yummy fruit veggies tomatoes peppers mushrooms spinach etc so many potatoes tortilla chips and dip salsa guac hummus etc smoothies and omg there is so much more that is just what i eat when i dont have a ton of time watch vegan recipes there are so many tasty easy things ily trish,NOT
the earnings gap calculation suffers from survivor bias  men are more willing to take on responsibility and more demanding roles some of them do well from this and others end up out of their depth and get fired the ones who get fired arent included in the average any more but the ones who do well are included this artificially skews the average towards men heres the math lets say we start with  men and  women each on k per year the average salary is k a year for both men and women then  men and  women move to k roles  women do well  get fired  men do well  get fired presuming same success rate between men and women total number of women remaining in the sample   total womens salary   k   plus   k   million average womans salary   total number of men remaining in the sample   total mens salary   k plus   k   million average mans salary   so the average mans salary ends up  higher just from this one factor  survivor bias,NOT
man im pretty sure trisha is not trans but i kinda can understand the confusion somewhat what i mean is im autistic and apparently  of all autististic people are trans  autistic men tend to have the white brain mass similar to a biological womans brain mass and so on i hear at least once a month that im trans or people really pushing to to are you sure you are not trans despite me telling them that yeah well im okay with being a woman but mentally im just behaving like a man interest in computers etc they keep pushing it and it definitely leads to some confusion of what i am whatever my passport says my gender is that itll be for now,NOT
for a culture change to happen it all starts with woman its their decision on what job they want its their decision if they want to stay at home and raise a family no one is forcing any of this on you if you end up with kids but dont want to quit working then dont talk about it to your spouse dont just accept it as oh im a woman so he expects me to quit my job no thats a stupid mentally youre just hurting yourself with a mind like that of course there are jobs out there that will prove too difficult for woman and thats just how our bodies were made men have more muscles than woman and their body structure helps with hard jobs but if you want that job too ladies you can although some might say its easier for men to grow in strength doesnt mean woman cant either,NOT
i love this ,NOT
my english teacher is sooo feminist and liberal we dont even learn english in class anymore,NOT
r e a l l y smh,NOT
just like gun control and the race war these ideassubjectsdebates are kept alive to generate revenuetraffic the majority is that they will never disarm america we have woman in power positions making substantial income we have had a president of color these topics generate alot of traffic,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working fulltime it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,NOT
ok i dont understand why yall are shaming her for this if she feels like she is transgender and identifies as a woman then so be it,NOT
thanks for coalescing all the research it paints a pretty comprehensive picture,NOT
 the guy said about vegans they are changing gods creation if god did create humans and science clearly shows that we humans were not designed to eat meat then we vegans are changing it back once our ancestors left herbivorism and became a carnivoreomnivore thats when humans changed gods creation as a vegan i feel a sense of pride to know we are fixing our ancestors mistakes and heading back to gods true intentions when god created humans,NOT
youve got to be fucking kidding me,NOT
im so happy youre going vegan if you get the whole melon from the store its much cheaper overall,NOT
she can only decided if shes trans however   drag queen is not a gender  being attracted to gay men  gay men are attracted to men of all types masc fem think bear otter  shes stereotyping traditional gender roles  if shes  ok with her gender and body  shes not trans to my understanding isnt being trans  meaning being uncomfortable in your own body because it doesnt match how you view and feel about yourself ,NOT
i think this video does a better job of explaining the wage gap than most videos however they dont do a good job of accounting for men and women in the same exact career for example in my job as a lawyer where everyone in the equivalent position gets paid the same the wage gap should be nonexistent if there happens to be one its because women choose to work less hours than men for some reason not because theyre getting paid less women make different life choices than men so that should be accounted for,NOT
freelee if you see this i would like to say thank you you are one of my favorite people out there you are getting the vegan movement out to people and you can see that write in people like trisha because maybe she will not be vegan for long but at least she is giving it a try and listening and maybe she will find how truly amazing being vegan truly is i love love love you so much and please keep doing what your doing because we damn well need people like you getting the message out to the world   with love zachari,NOT
why does everything have to escalate into violence and hatred cant people eat the way they want without having to defend themselves i eat whole food plant based but if you want to eat meat go ahead for the most part a persons mind is not going to be changed by someone badgering them into it the facts are out there for everyone to read make a choice that you are comfortable with,NOT
the world can end for all i care i just want my meat and dairy,NOT
this myth will never die people who want to believe that their failures are due to a worldwide conspiracy will always gravitate towards myths like this,NOT
hey  i had your app and it appears to have stopped working is it still running or not,NOT
now we should ask ourselves why are women in less paid jobs and that is not only because of choise only a small fragment of ceos and other high managing positions are female while studies suggest that women in leading positions are often better suited for these than men for example it is very likely that the  bank chrash happened majorly only due to male hormones and that way to much risk taking while women prefer to play it safe so now why is there this difference in leading positions i can not imagine any other way but sexism,NOT
the question is why some careers are so badly paid and what happens with non educated people i am not a feminist but i fine this not objective common sense many women in my country cant work longer because they hace to work longer at home this might apply in a rich countrymaybe but for sure not in peru,NOT
trish i know this may sound crazy but when i was in middle school i would hate it when old men would creep on me so i guess im trans,NOT
dear god these statistics are refreshing i had tremendous skepticism that systemic sexism existed in our job market,NOT
its very hard to listen to this airhead speak,ABU
remember to eat nuts beans and legumes aswell trisha and take the b maybe later if u continue veganism ,NOT
there is no gender pay gap its illegal to pay someone less based on their gender its been illegal for quite some time,NOT
lol ur my favvv,NOT
so women go for relationship type vocations men not so much go figure,NOT
havent even watched this yet but if this is true yess trish get in there girl love you so much more now,NOT
exactly thank you i think people who pretend that its  cents on the dollar for the same job are doing more harm than good and unfortunately that includes some people in the public spotlight like obama the implication is that women earn less because employers are mysogonists who systematically opress their female employees duh yet thats not whats happening there are many factors to consider the most obvious one being that men dont get pregnant and that women are less likely to disregard their family life and children in favor or their jobs,NOT
you are not going vegan you are going plant based vegan is much more than what you eat you just unboxed a leather purse the day before this,NOT
havent had meat since july thank you for being there to support and educate me,NOT
i never thought i could go vegan but i did and i love it i literally eat sooooooo much everyday and get the biggest food babies and the weight is still falling off also i used to have the worse acne and it cleared my skin so much try dates they taste like actual caramel,NOT
this is going to piss off some people,NOT
what was title  all about lets make track coed  then see what happens,NOT
maybe youre just trish and you dont need to put labels on yourself just do you date who you want dress how you want stop saying what you are and just be,NOT
that sure did last long im sure the chicken and waffles she snapped were gr though,NOT
trish is a whole headache tbh brah shes just making transgender more complicated,NOT
this is retarded if ur gonna take the time to find legitimate facts and begin to make a legitimate argument please dont then just generally claim the wage gap doesnt exist both sides here are trying to brainwash it would be appreciated if u used ur useful research for a purpose other than this blatant sexism,NOT
quinoa is an amazing source of protein and i find it to be an amazing food in general,NOT
this isnt sexism this is common sense boom,NOT
big shout out to all the liberal feminists out there you want to be equal to men well here you go,NOT
leave the state those are dudes,ABU
thank you so so so much,NOT
vegan since  and go on stronger than ever  best decision ever ,NOT
ive found most gay men attractive but it doesnt mean im a gay man  like wtf trish,NOT
perhaps the remaining  can be explained by the fact that women tend to enter the workforce later than men and interrupt their careers for long periods of time to raise a family,NOT
no fucking way is this clickbait i swear to god,NOT
now the compulsive liar claims shes got multiple personalities and insulted chloe of dissociadid and some of those with the disorder its not right,NOT
hm  never thought of it this way thats interesting,NOT
good luck trisha ,NOT
man this seriously makes me think they because trans because they knew they would be able to outrun the the women and make it to the top someday  i dont want to say its not a fair race but it kinda isnt when its just womens racing right no matter how much you feel like a woman youre not im sorry its just facts men are stronger faster than women not all but most are,ABU
conclusion there is an inequality in how men and women are paid but it isnt anywhere near as simple as people want it to be,NOT
or men could do cooperate equally with their kids and their house,NOT
she sounds like a female donald trump,NOT
yes trish slay youll notice major changes and youll feel very energetic but please please please do not calorie restrict and make sure you carb the fuck up,NOT
yaaaaaaay girl finally ,NOT
shes not trans being masculine doesnt make you a man if she had dysphoria i dont believe she would have gotten her boobs done so many times she even has a thing on her patreon where people can pay to help her get more plastic surgery shes just doing this for attention because she craves it,NOT
so you are going vegan  to lose weight  to mask your issues  hmm i bet this last a day,NOT

this why im christian i believe the woman does hard work taking care of the family while the father is at work to get all the supplies,NOT
trisha is notorious for trolling and trolling well shes very convincing i think this is just another example of her working her talent for lying to the internet lol honestly the real problem is the people who are actually like this theyre the ones who are pushing back a movement theyre the ones who are making a real mockery of the trans movement trisha is just a troll making money on peoples inability to realize shes lying no reason to make a big deal out of it imo  the transtrenders are the ones we should be mad about,NOT
girl shane and nikkie are offended,NOT
this is just offensive to everything lol,NOT
yasssss i am so happy ,NOT
im so happy you say you find it kind of hilarious because so do i its trisha paytas she uploads mental breakdowns on her kitchen floor as entertainment,NOT
ive never really believed that women get paid less for the same work i believe that women have a harder time getting on the top and do more jobs that make less money this video seems to prove my theory right,NOT
the wage gap is a compilation of average earnings between men and women it is and has been illegal to pay women less for the same job for nearly half a century,NOT
worlds fastest male runner male worlds fastest female runner also male,ABU
serious question if gender is a social construct then cant she say she is transgender wouldnt we have to believer her because gender can be anything if she were to say she is transsexual then i understand that she is crazy and trolling my understanding is that transgender is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and maybe dresses or acts as such but transsexual is when someone identifies as the opposite sex and takes steps to medically transition just trying to learn thanks  edit so is transgender even a thing then if you are just changing behaviorclothingstylepersonality that doesnt have to be a change from one gender to another if it were a change from one gender to another doesnt that just prove that masculinity and femininity are linked to sex idk this entire community is confusing to me i appreciate all insight,NOT
i love this video,NOT
edgy as it may be but honestly we human should start selective breeding people with mental disorder like genderfluid whtathefuckkerry or feminazi should not be allowed to reproduce,ABU
love animals  dont eat them  go vegan,NOT

and then arnie gives out thanksgiving turkeys to the underprivileged,NOT
when i even heard about it i was like why are we giving her the time and attention for this shes a troll and its kinda messed up for her to do that but she just wants attention and nothing more,NOT
for wage gap career choices and educational differences explain most if not all the gender gap in nursing and most of the other professions politicians play the wage gap cards by lying not truth,NOT
i think trisha is pansexual and is androgynous in terms of her gender expression,NOT
pay gap is it real or not theres so many controversial opinions about this but my opinion is somewhere in between information providing from some of the readings and viewings made me understand and gather some opinions of my own about gender pay gapgendered labor i actually believe that men are more favored in high paying jobs than women are in adams et al he provided some ideas and real life situations that might cause women to get paid less hold a lower position or not getting hired at all one of them things he mentioned was that some businesses prefer males because in this gendered stereotypical society women are more likely to leave work or miss work for family stuff unlike men where they will choose work first to be able to provide for their family because of this idea that men focus on work more than women it allows men to get promoted easier or get hired first in his book he also provided a list of equal situations for both men and women and how each of them are perceived differently i dont necessarily think theres an accurate pay gap where a man and women with the same job title get paid differently but i do think men are likely to get promoted higher than a women in order to pay them more in the video there is no gender wage gap she talked about how the wage gap isnt accurate because it counts for all women and all men working but it doesnt distinguishes between careers or whether they are part time or full time in her video i agree that more of the higher paying jobs is dominated by men and the lowest is dominated by women so of course you see the difference of the pay women and men get like she said its a choice but its also societys fault for making some careers seem gendered for example engineers for men and teaching for women personally im a liberal studies major and im choosing a low paying job im not sure why or even if i want to do it anymore because of this topic but it was my choice to go for a less paying career,NOT
the train wreck that is trisha,ABU
im soooo proud of you girl the vegan corner also has super nice vegan recipes try to stick to high carb low fat as much as you can but please dont stress yourself and enjoy the vegan treats when you want to all the best to you love xxx,NOT

shes trolling  she filmed that video back in june   last month theirs a video in her nd channel of her wearing the same outfit where she went to a movie premiere with sean she already filmed the music video which was daddy issues shes trying to get subs from this stunt smh,NOT
i think trish is trying to convince herself that shes a man to cope with the fact that straight men cheated on so many times shes insecure and hates being competition with other women which is a very fucked up for her to cope this way its just my theory dont come for me or come for me lets talk about it,NOT
if women actually got paid less why dont businesses hire only women women r usually more reliable and it was save businesses money,NOT
if i could hire a woman to do the same job at less pay i would only ever higher women,NOT
 most of those jobs dont have a potential to have flexible hours image a doctor or a firefighter  nope im gonna take a break now,NOT

i really enjoyed the video but it ended off by saying that we can fix the wage cap by changing hours thats good and all but we must not deter from the true goal of viewing each other as equals remember everyone respect women,NOT
plant based nutrition is the way forward  it is always hard to change people who have eaten meat and milk products all their lives my neighbour just died of cancer i have suffered a stroke people just are still ignorant of the causes of their problems and that diet change is the solution,NOT

freelee do your all high and mighty mz holier than thou and do a parody on trish friends and i hate you,NOT
i wish i had more people like you growing up i had a lot of people like trisha tell me because i wasnt stereotypical woman that i was trans,NOT
watch the documentaries even while youre vegan it really helped me,NOT
beans rice potatoes lentils lots and lots of fruit and veggies smoothies r fantastic ,NOT
they probably had to have a woman say this because no feminist would listen to or believe a man if he said the same thing,NOT
the other girls are happy because they are running yeah thats true but they arent winning competitions that could really change their future because a bunch of guys wearing makeup has destroyed their chances they have been working toward some even since they where young,ABU
rice with steamed vegetables or homemade potato wedges were my go to during the first month of becoming vegan they are super filling and really yummy i wish you luck on this crazy journey keep in mind that eating vegan isnt the hardest thing you will feel left out at times because people around you might be consuming animal products dont let that get to your head youre doing this for you i cant wait to hear how it goes c,NOT
idk she has to be trolling lmao,NOT
but what ive been taught in places like twitter and youtube is there are as many genders as there are pokemon characters so doesnt that mean there is a genders wage gap i know feminism is about having equal rights to a man but what about hold on let me just get the chart out demigirl genderqueer genderfluid agender bigender transgender and lets not forgot everyones oops every persons favourite gender attack helicopter the last one is quite new thanks lauren southern isnt it sexist to just only mention men and women especially because they are binary which in todays current social climate are inferior honestly i find this whole video triggering and i demand you spend money to make the appropriate safe spaces also screw trump for trying to help the american economy which also helps his allies economically as well,NOT
taco bell too omg taco bell is the shit for vegans,NOT
spicy stuff right here,NOT
ive seen trans girls run tht look like a man and identify as a male and they ran with women soo this should be the same they r natural born men tht identify as a female they should run with other boys,ABU
going vegan is not about going to a fast food restaurant and eating something that kinda sorta looks like meat its about cooking and eating plant based foods in your home i love the concept of the impossible burger or other fake meats but some are just as unhealthy as a lot of the other crap out there i get it means were not eating animals but i have a couple friends that are living off fake meat and now claiming that veganism isnt helping w weight loss and other benefits of veganism because theyre still eating like crap,NOT
oh and get the meatdairy vegan replacement products if that helps you literally anything you like now can be found cruelty free,NOT
its always good when a woman debunks this crap cuz its more likely to be heeded,NOT
i love trisha with my heart and soul but i dont think this will last lmao,NOT
her hair looks so good,NOT
back in  when i was went to japan a girl that i traveled there with continually tried to convert and pick up this gay guy that we were working with she just wouldnt give up it was quite entertaining because obviously she got no where with him having said that why dont you and trish just be vegan,NOT
im so so proud of you stay strong and trust me you will feel so amazing after the first  days you will feel light gurl keep it up and hold on to that feeling u get when you saw the slaughter house vid,NOT
it is somewhat unfair because boys develop more muscle mass than girls expecially after puberty and on average boys are taller and have longer legs,NOT
honestly this whole thing is annoying even my teachers and im in th grade are saying that the wage gap is a thing cant wait to show them this thanks prageru,NOT
woot go trish ,NOT
honestly just that clip of the farm to fridge in this vid made me go vegan,NOT
whats sad is shes being more sane and making more sense than the ppl saying there are  million genders ,NOT
to everyone in the comments sayin that carbs are bad nothey arent fruit and vegetables are carbs starches like breads rice potatoes and pasta those are not bad they help to fill you up because simpler carbs like fruit and veg are burned super quickly some people cant eat a ton of processed carbs but rice and potatoes to fill you up and lots of greens and veggies are good for weightloss carb up girl youll feel great dont restrict yourself eat kn abundance you deserve to feed your body well,NOT
let me guess feminists this woman is being held captive by the patriarchy,NOT
omg trish a snippet of this video was on the news talking about how red meat is unhealthy,NOT
no one trish im attracted to gay men so i must be transgender,NOT
eat only what you grow or produceproblem solved,NOT
i wondered how they calculated the wage gap but if they do it that way its not proving except that men earn more on average feel like showing this to my form tutor who always goes on bashing about men and how were the bain of all evil,NOT
trish those were cherriesm,NOT
good luck trish much love from your fishies ,NOT
lets force women to not child rear yeah right just leave it and forget it,NOT
about time someone put up a video that shows truth,NOT
men earn more because on average they both work about  more hours a week and  more years of their life      gives you  theres your pay gap more money for doing more work and that seems fair,NOT
pizza with no cheese is usually vegan veggie sushi fries rice hummus with your baby carrots there are loads of nice filling things that arent meat and fill you up xx,NOT
a wild incorrect feminist has appeared you use facts  the wild incorrect feminist didnt like that critical hit anyway,NOT
people who disliked this just cant accept the facts,NOT
all fruit and vegetables have protein,NOT
well since men earn more doesnt it make since that they keep working while women take care of the kids but also who cares,NOT
you have my support,NOT
got my watermelon juice got my beyond burger on my daves bread lets friggin watch this,NOT
thanks for sharing your research,NOT

fuck this fuck this,ABU
yaaaassssssss im so happy,NOT
good for you trish good luck ,NOT
excellent video keep up the good work pbn,NOT
really insightful no comment on cultural pressures or norms that would have a woman choose not to be in a male dominated work place,NOT
they are only competing against the girls as the are only average in the boys competition if they had any repect for women and were really trans they would not do this you dont see trans men doing this as they would not have an advantage like trans women do some trans women are so entitiled like men because that is what they are,ABU
this just clearly shows that some people have nothing to do,NOT
some women are either just dumb or simply stupid for thinking a myth such as the wage gap actually exists,ABU
hi freelee  i hope youre all right in the last couple of videos you seem so unhappy and kinda insecure i know that there is a lot of stuff going on on the internet and lots of people just spread negativity i hope youll get through this time and be fine always remember youre worth it youve helped so many people and changed their lifes to a better youre a good person dont let the haters get you down ,NOT
the wage gap myth is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,NOT
just watch some vegan what i eat in a days to get inspiration for meal ideas,NOT
im really happy for you trish i hope you achieve your goal im a big fan and i can see this working out for you good luck,NOT
yess trish im so happyi am vegan and i am loveing the lifestyle ,NOT
i feel like she is overthinking everything and is going through some sort of crisis she might just need some help o dont mean to be rude but i think she might just be struggling with mental health issues,NOT
equality some are more equal than others,NOT
so im  and really want to go vegan mostly because of im not exactly happy with my body and im also have some mind slitting headaches and i feel that eating right would help me with that health stuff the problem is that being so young my parents dont really agree which i hate because i cant really buy my own food i am paying for my gym membership which i will do happily but i simply can afford to buy by own meals money from work i choose to mostly put into college savings please leave suggestions if you have any god bless,NOT
gurl you look gorgeous and i agree if she wouldnt troll shed get way better results,NOT
great video vox this is why i subscribed,NOT
no all this is fake news the patriarchy is behind it all reeeeeeeeeeeee,NOT
in your snapchat today u ate chicken i do not know if it was vegan chicken or not but fucking love the fact that u are atleast trying,NOT
oh honey no please please please educate yourself before making a public video if you really are trans than i support you  but you really need to get your facts straight first maybe seek some council from the trans community i hope your prepared for some major backlash from this video hun not judging or bullyingjust trying to warn ya,NOT
i love you christina,NOT
brilliant as always,NOT
im not vegan but ive at least become vegetarian and wanted to say thank you ,NOT
so just curious why you gagged at most if not all of the  vegan things you had on your taste test video funny how you want to go all vegan now,NOT
so basically your literally pansexual,NOT
shes so pretty,NOT
omg amazing ,NOT
 i act like a dude  of the time and im not gay or trans or anything and would never claim to be lol im just being me why do people have to push themselves into marginalized groups to feel better about themselves its really weird,NOT
first you talk about full time jobs and then yous name one of the things that they dont take into account is hours per week i agree with your point i just find it disapointing that something like this is in here,NOT
considering the wage gap doesnt exist i dont see what there is to see,NOT
the fires are actually being caused by directed energy weapons lazars do not have red beaming lines theyre actually not seeable to the eye this is strongly controversial and is patented there are documents over this and video footage their doing this all around the world lets never forgot when nato forces indonesia into dirty work by creating artificial tsunamis japan is affected by heart quakes from threat from leaders who own the private bank corporation lets especially not forget how the only countries in the world who arent under the world bank are the middle east and they are the only countries in a war a war started by you guessed it the ones who use these energy weapons artificial weather have been at war every single year for the past  years has every politician bought out and paid for is the united states of americas which is a corporation with a president and offices do note district of columbia is not a state do note were born into debt through social security and by birth are expected to pay taxes to private shareholders in a federal reserve thats private you dont believe me you mustnt believe your self strong neglect because youre conditioned by birth to think on the contrary conversely though its foreseen by thousands of government officials all of this disclosed information and other countries who suffer america is the laughing stock out of all of them were blind to the truth and within blind faith we believe we are free our freedom is an illusion that our vote matters let alone count all of these problems resonate upon our disbelief its even happening we are the reason all of this is happening because we settle and agree on it as a republic democracy were a totalitarian corporate oligarchy sitting on a time bomb so far we cant even stand up if we stood up it would all blow up metaphorically if we all stood up together it would all collapse under the new world order in control by the elites of this world the bank owners rockefellers rothschild corporations have long paid out politicians and government officials to carry out their agenda thats why you never see anything happen thats why you see things get changed and nothing goes through arnold s is right about things not going through but its not him thats right hes carrying on a message hes advocating for it but hes not saying it these activists are using a little girl to carry out their information because they know the outcome corporate greed will destroy them and they will be homeless or if not last night so and so killed them selveswere shot like honestly yall think epstein killed himself i knew this before memes came out before it even happened theres another field of activism going on behind the actual activism,NOT
let me guess the koch brothers are somehow behind this website,NOT

i fucking love blaire that intro has me dead no absolutely not not trans and i feel its a huge middle finger to the lgbtq community for someone whos straight even im offended,NOT
stuff like rice beans lentils quinoa is very good to have for a vegan diet because you can do so my things with it im so happy youre doing this stay positive and keep up the good work trish ,NOT
this is so much better and more nuanced than that last shitty video vox released on the wage gap,NOT
i really hope she statesman and inspires others and then we can save more fur babies,NOT
i think everyone should just stop saying anything in the comments ya the video is complicated af but shes also human and she should be able to call her self identity or think of her self as anything and should be able to feel comfortable saying anything when its talking about her mental state of mind we support anyone else in the world when it comes to these kinds of things so why can we not support her ya shes know for a lot of scandals online but that shouldnt effect youre output on anyone when it comes to there feelings,NOT
usually im not the type to gatekeep but honestly knowing trisha this is the biggest insult to the trans community if this is a joke its offensive she either wants attention or is confused is she really trying to convince us she has gender dysphoria ,NOT
someone send this video to john oliver plz,NOT
female tennis players earn the same in major tournaments for less work,NOT
does she know what non binary means because the whole time she keeps saying how she sometimes likes being feminine and masculine but then calls herself transgender and a gay man  wth is going on,NOT
this is unfair,ABU
if you are going vegan for looks i would also suggest an hour of workout everyday there are really great videos online that have helped me lose  pounds you dont need to starve yourself eating many greens are good too for protean beans are the best way to go but yes healthy diet no fast foods and veggies and fruit gluten free pastas stuff like that and workout  minutes to  hour will for sure help you loose weight and tone your body just remember that loosing weight and all that jazz will take time but i  support i think going vegan is going to help you so much and i wish you good luck,NOT
im not even going to finish this video already sounds dumb ,NOT
shes trolling period and laughing all the way to the bank,NOT
i should stop hating this i feel like i am hating dumb woman because i am being rejected by girls that i hit on and should just go for the ugly ones instead of hot girls,NOT
where the feminists at,NOT
there is no wage gap people just simply have different jobs and different promotion,NOT
recent studies show that the wage gap only equates to  cents to the dollar,NOT
i am a gendernonconforming person and i hate when celebritiesyoutubers do shit like this for attention ,NOT
love this channel,NOT
i concur with the notion of increasing flexibility of hours but i find that to be an inevitability and moot from this perspective,NOT
ok if youre doing studies on people making over k a year and then comparing wage gaps then i want nothing to do with this this seems like an elitist problem to me,NOT
she goes vegan for  weeks not for ever  we will see ,NOT
but these fathers are sacrificing their free time and seeing their family because they are working more to make their family lives better you have to include sick time off overtime,NOT
capitalism is a fancy and more acceptable way of slavery multiculturalism is a an acceptable and less violent way of genocide,NOT
just because you wish you were a man cuz you think life is easier as a man doesnt mean your transgender ,NOT
blair chick fil a is outwardly homophobic and donates to anti lgbt groups,NOT
this video ignores how much worse the gender wage gap affects women of color  cents on the dollar for white women  cents on the dollar for black women and  cents on the dollar for hispanic women,NOT
but i the point is women arent getting into as well paid jobs as men on average not that them doing the exact same job gets less money,NOT
lmfaooo just because you dont wear makeup doesnt mean youre trans many woman are tom boys that doesnt mean their trans i dont wear makeup and i look disgusting half the time that doesnt mean im trans shes clearly trolling,NOT
i love this woman the team making these animations keep it up d,NOT
this is so unfair for biological women these are men and no amount of estrogen will make them into women you cant change biology,ABU
since trish loves to troll im not holding my breath on this being real,NOT
trisha just needs some trans folks to help them figure out what theyre feeling and put that into societys labels and proper vocabulary if theyre gonna give an explanation to the world if youre trans and you hate when ppl misgender you or treat you the wrong way just bc you dont pass well or you just started your trans journey dont do that to others ofc this video is a mistake and makes no sense but thats also how trisha usually make videos lmao just chill and wait till some time passes and they get more information and education so they can talk properly about they feelings,NOT
this woman is a legend,NOT
all the petty shade you threw at the start of this vid the location the food the wardrobe choiceloooooove  this is vodka btw you slay girl,NOT
i love you now trisha and im following u now cause of ur decision of going vegan its my going to be easy in the beginning but its going to be worth it ,NOT
this video made me subscribe,NOT
ask god to show you what people are going through now,NOT
vegan since january  never going back,NOT
trisha just shut the fuck up,ABU
i agree in most cases two people rarely get paid for the same work in the organization that i work for same for most they use pay ranges depending on your experience education etc you are made an offer you can then negotiate for more pay or just take it so i guarantee there are women that make more than me with the same pay grade and vice versa,NOT
so whos working in the oil fields and coal mines,NOT
you can eat tofu,NOT
i put this in watch later so i can show to every stupid feminist who uses this,NOT

women make  to a mans  but the mans only left with ,NOT
its cheating plain and simple,ABU
she ate sour cream chips like an hour ago on sc,NOT
its simple men are provenly dominant physically to women so just because these transgenders mentally are women that doesnt mean that they are physically women so therefore is like putting a male to compete against females,NOT
who is at   thanks in advance ,NOT
youre gender fluid,NOT
i watched trisha long before she had a partnership and was a huge youtube star she is completely odd years ago she said she was a lesbian despite dating males before that and considering herself straight i also find it hard for her to call herself transsexual because she always seemed comfortable identifying as a cis female in the past,NOT
rough video to watch,NOT
im sorry but this whole vid smells like bullshit trish,NOT
tired of this bullshit am unsubscribing,NOT
and let me ask why is it that best paid jobs are dominated by males and worst paid jobs by females i mean as a scientist arguing that there are so so soooo many variables i cant handle them all doesnt mean the correlation isnt real theres a wage gap as tiny as you want it to be and theres a clear difference in how jobs are distributed theres also a habit from males to work longer hours or night shifts while women wont these are all correlations telling you something you cant deny their existence and thats why we are all saying theres sexism involved the reason behind sexism well we have to figure it out thats science awful video really,NOT
trisha is a very manipulative person she will do and say anything for views,NOT
alphabet community are hilarious there are two genders scientifically cant argue with science people,NOT
im going vegetarian ill be eating eggs from my own chickens so i wont promote the egg industry and ill be going to have alternative to milk so i wont support the dairy industry,NOT

you need protein first then fat and then carbs the least amount you are eating pure carbssugar,NOT
women and men get paid the same for the same work,NOT
so are people saying boys are better than girls  so unfair  if you want to win you do the work  you get stronger  yo get faster  you win  but you do the work,NOT
people like you will have a very special place in hell trying to get some hype on behalf of people who are actually struggling with disorder is beyond low you are harming people just for what to get some activity in your comment section or what oh i had a short haircut so im trans yeah sure and every guy who chooses to have long hair is trans as well then by your logic what you gonna do next claim you have a brittle bone disease because you have broken an arm once that you have cancer because you feel funny shame on you none of you fakes claimed you were trans back when it was really dangerous im disgusted absolutely disgusted go rob some kid in d grade for his lunch money next,ABU

seed gender in title triggered,NOT
yes so need a what i eat in a day vegan style,NOT
super video with a great collection about vegan i like to say that the vegans are good but vegitarians are good too,NOT
this is intellectualized propaganda very cute,NOT
this is the kinda shit you keep to yourself,NOT
woo hoo cheers to klaus from pbn great job dude,NOT
yeah i saw this last night so good left her some comments ,NOT
inasmuch as they are wrong i would put greater responsibility onto those people the sports and government officials who let them get what they want cheaters have their own way to get what they want these dudes simply got it in the name of rights the officials should know better these dudes could not join if the officials didnt let them the officials simply are too wimp to stand for what is sane and what is right,NOT
so stupid after they separate the careers they still had a gap the tittle of this video is a lie,NOT
next olympics alot of womens records will fall thanks to heshes,NOT
honestly i dont trust a word she saysi hope she does but it seems like shes all talk,NOT
its just hysterical how the sjws are upset about this now you did this to yourself yall are the ones who promote the idea of everyone can be trans just cuz they say they are,NOT
anyone ever noticed how most of the people that are trash talking veganism are over weight or look inflamed and unhealthy except that one guy that looks like he took hgh ,NOT
trisha stopped being vegan,NOT
you are so annoying your like the vegan paparazzi just checking who goes vegan go on with your vegan life and leave others alone,ABU
so what will be vegan burgers will be many chemicals in food ,NOT
great channels that dont promote any specific way to be vegan or pseudoscience hot for food unnatural vegan edgy veg kalel so youre dating a vegan there are so many ways to be vegan what freelee promotes with the unlimited calories wont help you lose weight in  weeks many people gain weight when they start eating like her but then slowly slim down over time for two weeks you dont wanna eat more than your recommended calorie intake but definitely dont starve yourself the more whole foods you eat the better find food with the least amount of processing and ingredients,NOT
respect the wamen,NOT
this is our future,NOT
woah a slightly controversial prageru video better watch it before youtube censors it,NOT
department of labor releases report refuting wage gap obama for the next  years ignores report keeps preaching about the gender wage gap,NOT
 glaring issues one mathmatical and the other conceptual begining with the marh youre using the word median and average interchangeably wich skews your conclusion as they are not the same thing to show this differences ill use simple numbers if you have a data set a set of numbers representing value the numbers in this example are chosen to display the difference between between average and median that contains these  numbers   to find the average of these numbers you find the sum  and devide it by the amount of numbers  this average however does not account for the massive outlier a number far removed from the main grouping in the data set wich skews the data higher if you wanted the median of this data set you count inward from both sides to find the middle number with  the number with  numbers on each side of it wich is  in this case  though that difference seems small  and  are pretty close the numbers we used in this example are small and when you start comparing data sets and bring percentages into it the difference becomes bigger imagine we have a different data set lets call it set b and call our original set a and set b has an average of  and a median of  if we compare the averages we get a  different because  they are the same number however if you compare median you get a  different as  and  that difference is small with are numbers but when you have larger data sets like data on wages that percentage makes a difference and that difference between average and median can skew your conclusion wich is why all the citations of information in this video are incorrect because youre using studies that compare medians and studies that compare averages together and interchangeably and therefore reaching a not entirely incorrect but nevertheless fallacious conclusion now issue  a bit shorter you cite that  too paying jobs are primarily male and  lowest are mostly female and when accounting for this you get a very small wage gap however the comparison of the total averages yields a larger gapthis inherently means that more women work in lower paying jobs wich speaks to a larger sexism issue not with individual employers or even individual industries as youve shown the gaps with industry accounted for is small but can can meaning might indicate a larger issue that because if societal expectations women mostly go into certain fields fields that pay less than mostly male dominated fields congrats to making to the end hope this does something,NOT
if it is possible to hire women that add the same value as any man on a significantly lower salary then surely free market forces would ensure that no men are hired because the leading company in every industry would be the ones which exclusively hire women due to their wage bill being the lowest and therefore before being able to drive out all the competition with lower prices just a thought or maybe the patriarchy doesnt want its firms to be run in the most costefficient way because they love oppressing women too much clearly that is the more likely explanation,NOT
i wanna be famous im gonna make a video about coming out as a pop tart dragon and send it to my friends and family along with everyone at school and hope it goes viral,NOT
go watch hotforfood im not a vegan but the food she makes looks amazing x,NOT
so women should find jobs can work flexible hours instead of asking men to take their own responsibility for the family,NOT
so the earnings gap is due to womens choices is what youre saying women more often choose not to go for jobs if they have to work less flexible hours whereas men more often choose to go for those jobs fair and square no problem there,NOT
finally prager gets something right,NOT
omg omg that is so cool,NOT
didnt you already make this video,NOT
my favorite youtube channel going to head over and buy some merch,NOT
i mean shes not actually serious,NOT
fans of shoe on head love this what was that thing under the video,NOT
we learned this my senior year of college in marketing management management strategic operations marketing consumer behavior  management organization behaviors,NOT
this isnt fair now girls will lose scholarships to boys,NOT
one huge thing that the video missed was that women take off time from work when they have children in some cases women take off as much as  or  years from their career studies show women end up going back into different career fields or different companies and basically starting all over after having a child what must that do to their professional development and potential to earn any feminist who demands a woman get paid the same as a man after she is taking years off of professional development and work is being extremely sexist themselves if you work harder and longer you deserve more,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense  quote of the century,NOT
 please just send this bitch a strap on ,NOT
who cares who you have sex with or how you identify this is a sport fact is if we had crazy monsters or beautiful angel faries or a new and ultimate super boring human there would be biological physical differences i mean id like to see the flip side interview with trans females to male in the nhl or nfl or something it would be an interesting piece to put it lightly so just add a category you dont even have to re invent the landscape if nobody is ashamed of how they identify and nobody is shaming them why not show up to cheer a trans friend on obviously referring to them as they identify male or female at their event the way you would a bio girl or a guy everyone is happy done funny the sjws are seemingly the only ones name calling here haha,NOT
whats also missed is that as men are progressing up the career ladder many of their female counterparts are taking time off work to have children no woman is going to be offered a raise then,NOT
i strongly believe trisha is mentally ill shes always got some type of controversy going on and comes up with the most oddest things to say no way can she ever be taken seriously not even the lgbtq community could take this one seriously she needs help,ABU
proud of you,NOT
omg trisha i have always loved you vegan or not vegan girl you have it sooo right and i love love love this video  eat tons of fruit drink lots of water avoid oil eat less processed foods make sure to eat a salad once a day and never restrict your calories you can do this girl i love u for trying it out and totally understanding the message  much love from a vegan and fan,NOT
im not confused by what i like what a crock of shyte,ABU
vegans dont do anything animals still get killed and just because they are not eating meat doesnt mean that animals are safe now,NOT
i quit listening at the women earn  less comment   vs  is  less or  as much but not  less if they cant even understand gradeschool math can we really trust anything they have to say concerning the law of supply and demand in a freemarket economy,NOT
amazing just impenetrable faith can we list feminism as a religion already,NOT
depend on whether they went through natural puberty and how long theyve been on cross sex hormones,NOT
how could someone dislike the video its disliking facts classic liberals lol,NOT
nice to see so many vegans love yaaa,NOT
im fairly impressed most other liberal shows and news sources miss out on these points,NOT
that trisha video disgusts me but all liers for attention disgust me xd but in general the whole movement to use the transgender community for clicks is big oof sometimes they can even hurt real trans people through the bullshit they are talking just in that sense that normalcis people who see it will get this picture of trans and apply it to everyone they meet in real life who is really trans and treat them badly or in a way they dont deserve to be treated also make more videos with your cat he or she is a cutie xd,NOT
earnings gap not wage gap big difference men are willing to work longer hours and are more flexible with working strict schedules is it any surprise they earn more on average but for each hour their wage is still the same as their female counterparts wagegapmyth,NOT
google under pays men,NOT
there are some rare fields that women earn more then men like construction but they also make up less than  of the workforce so like small victory mmmhhhh ,NOT
so what you just let them not play at all they dont want to be on the boys teamso,ABU
i think that you should go visit the channel mommy tang because she gives great vegan advice its a mukbung channel but she is vegan tell her i sent you,NOT
everyone has a different way of identifying bcos trish doesnt identify how you do doesnt mean its wrong its trishs view point,NOT
jim jeffers can explain this in a better way,NOT
trish yay st thing you are going plant based not vegan if you were going vegan you would stay true to it for the rest of your life since veganism is about eco not ego nd buy bread potatoes a whole watermelon or whole cantaloupe since they are cheaper than precut rd thing buy rice and a ricecooker they will change your life try to stay low on fat and salt aswell as added sugar and last thing to remember fish is not a vegetable and gelatin aswell a whey is not vegan im so happy for you and if you need any tips ask me of the twitter vegan community we are all welcoming to new people who want to save the earth oh and one last thing make sure your newest makeup products are cruelty free and vegan makeup is for humans not animals,NOT
if they could pay women less just hire all women but they all get paid the same,NOT
hi trisha  i just started a vegan diet  weeks ago and i wanted to tell you i feel great i do struggle with it and you are right baby steps i dont want to fill up your comment section with recipes but i have quite a few that make me not miss meat at all and that are super yummy if you like you can message me and ill send them to you keep up the good work i know its hard,NOT
trisha is just a troll who wants to get people taking she isnt transgender shes trans stupid,ABU
have they been castrated ,NOT
there are a few good points in here but with the amount of bs and lack of research they are overlooked i implore ya t to do some research on gender fluid also never relate someone who is lgbtq to someone with a disability thats all i got for now,NOT
what your describing doesnt sound like trans at all sounds more like gender nonconforming or nonbinary,NOT
freelees body may be great but her attitude and what she says to people makes her an ugly person,NOT
when you cant think of a video idea,NOT
not complaining stating facts they both competing in mens track and were not even top  then they switched to female and now they are top  period this is not fair this is against women,NOT
destroy bad capitalism,NOT
ive been waiting for this yesss and no shes not her views are probably just down ,NOT
your a dude dude stop trying to steal because you couldnt compete as a dude dude,ABU
omg mama im so happy to see this video eat lots of carbs lots of rice beans lentils pasta bread potatoes ect to keep yourself full fruit is also amazing but snack on fruit instead of cakes and chips even if theyre vegan theyre still not healthy in large amounts if you keep your food carb full and tasty i swear you will feel amazing after two weeks you wont want to go back to eating animal products it honestly makes you feel like a new person those first few weeks its like detoxing your body of all the bad i felt incredible and full of energy when i first turned vegan you should watch mommy tang she does really awesome vegan mukbangs with pretty simple and delicious recipes blog your vegan meals too or do some mukbangs for us please mama  love you blessed be ,NOT
if a  yro man can identify as a  yro girl and get praised by the trans community i see no problem with trisha being a gay man stuck in the body of a woman,NOT
cry babies disliking the video aproaching,NOT
pretty sure trisha is just trolling everyone again,NOT
i think i think i just got second hand dysphoria is that even possible right now djjaskdnisneid ,NOT
excellent i hated seeing animals being killed and took action by not eating animals,NOT
this is going to flip eventually academically females are far out performing males in addition many male dominated industries that dont necessarily depend on higher education are being outsourced or automated recent statistics referenced on other videos similar to this one suggest that almost every college degree holding profession with the exception of stem fields are already majority women also recently there has been a focus on equalizing that field do no doubt this field will see dwindling male presence it make financial sense that the spouse with the lowest earning potential stays home with kids ie house husbands soccer dads,NOT
a channel to check out for information and such on the vegan diet is unnatural vegan she is awesome and very informative  good luck,NOT
 years plant based best decision ever made for helping our environment for fat loss antiageing and improving the health of those around me,NOT
couple of dudes with weave this is a joke,ABU
i just love to watch these videos and see other peoples perspectives all views are going to come from some source of truth which makes me think it could be more complicated than the analysis in this video,NOT
here comes the tea videos,NOT
great film  thank you for sharing this i am not a big fan of the vegan label but i technically i am one so i love the films message i prefer the wfpb approach which pritikin mcdougall greger campbell esselstyn promote so while i wouldnt eat a vegan sausage roll i like that no animals were harmed in its making,NOT
this is a mental breakdown,ABU
i am a guy i could never attempt this kind of scam these two are losers i am astonished that they feel no shame or guilt,ABU
for protein you can get beans nuts and protein shakes for the shakes go to jewel they are bomb i hope his helps,NOT
wow this is simply not truth and yes we know why there is this  gap there are thousands of studies proving that if men were taking care of every single activity that women are expected to do outside their professional activities like working at home cleaning or taking care of kids women simply could take these men jobs and earn more because there are no naturally men jobs this is not simply a math issue but a gender gap in social responsibilities between women and men and this is science not a myth or any math error by spreading these messages you show a clear ideological point of view and not a scientific one as you want is to believe,NOT
nothing feels better than triggering feminists its the new hilarious pastime,NOT
make sure to carb the fuck up,NOT
if you dont want to watch the whole thing its just her confusing gender identity and sexual orientation she is a gay man physicallymentally now because she likes men who are also gay and that leads her to believe that she must be a man on the inside if i may add  as a cisfemale i also find the gay men she features on her channel to be extremely attractive but i know that is one sided on my behalf as their sexual orientation doesnt match mine but trisha seems to believe becoming a gay man will solve this dilemma of one sided attractions ,NOT
still abnormal as all your dots from the graphs you show are below the zero line meaning theres a tendency anyways towards wage gap which is the problem  it is not about how big of a gap it is about the fact that there is one where there shouldnt be any,NOT
lmfaooo was jason gay ,ABU
girl you know ityes you know it girl you know it,NOT
maybe its meant for a better collab to be maded,NOT
hell yeah girlfriend good for you i hope it works out well beans potatoes and avocados are lovely and filling,NOT

hot for food channel is still savior,NOT
i love trishs trolling in this one,NOT
trisha is either so clueless its pathetic or she is just cruel making a mockery of people,ABU

oh my god i love this so proud of you i got a healthy mindset suffered from ed for the past years anorexia  bulimia and cured all my allergies food related eczema pollen fur and so on when i went vegan a year ago carbs are good for you and you should never restrict your calories i love ripebrown spotty bananas and dates soo sweet and eat nicecream for breakfast everyday have some recipes on my channel if you are interested fruit greens beans lentils rice potatoes pasta are good staples hugs ,NOT
and your cat,NOT
honestly i think she may be confused with what she is or what she wants to be and that is ok she may have come about this in a wrong uneducated way but everyone should just try to understand what she is going through and be a bit more compassionate,NOT
imagine being trisha and begging for attention online every day tragic,NOT
that was one of trishas best troll video ever,NOT
thank you for making this film,NOT
they miss that it dosnt exists,NOT
actually fuck yourself youre female in every single way you are not trans you do not have gender dysphoria i am so insulted by this as a real transgender man you have zero masculinity which is needed to be female to male ask a doctor educated on the human brain or gender identities and they will say you are born with a male or female brain you were born with a female brain and everyone sees that you are far too old to be doing this shit with the amount of people who know you it is so wrong to be posting this it is wrong to allow anyone to think being transgender is even  a choice jesus please delete your channel,ABU
this is unfair to the girls they are boys,ABU
they have vegan burgers pizza tacos ice cream everything you can think of just gotta shop at the right grocery stores and go to vegan restaurants,NOT
im a man who is attracted to men who are only attracted to men so that must make me a man but im gonna keep being a woman and tell them that im a man,NOT
muscles glistening in the wind floored me,NOT
animals food is so yummy yummy in my tummy,NOT
vox now declared antifeminist due to its correct and factual ideology of the wage gap,NOT
well going vegan doesnt just mean changing what you eat it also includes beaty products such as lotions soaps bath bombs and make up for example her false eye lashes she uses arent vegan most mascaras are made from bat manure its very hard to find vegan mascaras and most lipsticks are made from crushed up beatles i know very gross but i believe she will try very hard but it takes someone very very special and i dont think shes cut out for it i could be very wrong,NOT
do not eat as much as u want so many people have gained weight following that advice eat until you are satisfied not stuffed  look up high carb hannah she gained like  pounds when she followed freelee and started a new vegan diet and has lost  pounds she has lots of what i eat in a day and recipes  good luck on your new journey,NOT
what happened with men being equal to women where are the metoo brigade here,NOT
i think thatits the heroine,ABU
trish hotforfood on instagram and youtube best vegan recipes ever,NOT
just because youre female it doesnt mean you need to embody femininity ive been a tom boy all my life doesnt mean im trans,NOT
the worst part about these comments are that teachers are are teaching this false belief that the wage gap exists at my old job i was the only female who would work doubles and be there when no one wanted to when it came time i got the raises and then became a manager hard work pays off,NOT
finally some common sense vox you can be hit or miss sometimes but there is a reason i stay subbed thanks for all the info i appreciate it,NOT

how do you identify as ur natural gender which is a girl but then u identify as trans wtf ,NOT
omg also try making a burrito bowl you can add quinoa salsa and beans with corn and green chick peas its soooooo good,NOT
there are biological reasons men and women do not compete against each other in sports how about four categories men women transgender men and transgender women this may be the only logical solution,ABU
think about this hr is the largest highest paid femaledominated job in america they know the wage data for everyone in the company how long theyve worked there and their job performance they are responsible for making sure employees are treated equitably and fairly in the company to avoid labor law infractions you know like the equal pay law if there is such thing as a wage gap you can blame hr in other words its women keeping women down,NOT
go look on the vegan corner great for recipes xx,NOT
i see more triggered men in the comments than feminists lmao,NOT
the best tip i can give you is if you need to eat fast food go to taco bell for the most vegan options just substitute beans for mean and order no cheese or sour cream or go to wendys and get a baked potato plain with ketchup packets or whatever you want with it,NOT
even their voices remain deep testosterone is raging through their veins still even with one year of hormone suppression what about natural bone structure and muscle mass i cant believe this is even a discussion its frustrating,ABU
piers morgan ran out of america now insulting vegans id hardly call him mainstream journalism lol see that neck and thick gut he should eat more vegetables and less animal products  id bet his negative attitude would also change for the better,NOT
t i think that this is a very real thing i think you should just take a breath and think ya know,NOT
how can u be a transgender when u didt undergo a fucking transition,NOT
so there is its just that girls are conditioned to go into careers that we value less as a society and the small gap within careers has negotiating skills and self worth evaluation ability to factor in again conditioned by upbringing and society,NOT
im so happy youre trying to go vegan so proud of you the best advice i can give you is to take vitamins to maintain your calcium and protein i take calcium vitamins as well as b now if youre just looking to do this for two weeks i recommend for breakfast smoothies bananas with almond butterprotein and drinking almond or hazelnut milk also eating lots of seeds and nuts are very good and yummy i make my own trail mixes for lunch time quinoa is also awesome dont give up and try your best to continue with this it gets easier as you go also theres vegan alternatives to hot dogs burgers and meat balls not the healthiest but if your craving that sort of food theres options love you,NOT
im more than happy to go veganplant based im not prepared to take a gamble on the future of the planet and live ignorance its all our problem if we dont change we do so at our peril were all going to end up like the film soylent green,NOT
mel joy also went vegan,NOT
oh my god yesyesyesyeyseys yay yay ayay ayayayya im so proud of u and try for a month thats when u rly see a differene,NOT
i am pan and i love gay men and would fuk them if given the chance so um ,NOT
insecticides mostly petroleum based that are sprayed on the plants contaminates the bees who pollinate everything and the run off contaminates the streams i live behind a  acre soy bean field and the ammonia fertilizer that is sprayed sometimes is so strong i cant breath i have raised bees that die because of mass spraying of insecticides so dont act like you are saving the world by eating your veggies you want to save the world grow your own veggies and good luck trying to raise a productive garden without using pesticides  i have raised many gardens and it aint easy i have chickens and they will lay a egg a day without a rooster if they arent eaten they will just rot a rooster has to be present before they can get fertilized to hatch life so i have no problem with vegetarians but because a egg is in cornbread or cake and you cant eat it because you are vegan thats just a little out there for me but i still respect you  i also have a few well cared for cows and goats who clean up the land so i dont have to mow ,NOT
so proud i love avocado toast or avo bagels for breakfast ,NOT
im soooooo proud and btw you can ask for anything on starbucks with soy milk or coconut milk or almond milk etc ,NOT
proofe that feminism is bullshit,NOT
im  sure that im a transformer i know im human but idk i feel like a robot in disguise maybe there is more than meets the eye,NOT
if people are meant to eat meat then why are the animals scared to die that seems like a very cruel world to mei mean if they didnt care that might be different but theyre scared and they want to live,NOT
this feels like it shouldve been a private video of her just saying her thoughts to her self but she accidentally posted it,NOT
freelees body may look good trish but her character and the at she treats people makes her ugly af,ABU
your graf at  isent so accurate xd,NOT
totall fuckin bullshit by the way im not sorry,ABU
finally somewhere i can be of help beans are a very good source of protein on a vegan diet as a milk substitute you can have rice almond coconut cash you and soymilk i believe there are few more milk substitutes but those are the only ones i can remember as of the moment if you were looking for an amazing meat substitute i highly recommend a brand beyond meat they are the best meat substitute i have come across i recommend their beast burgers there also so soy free which is something you need to keep in mind soy in large amounts can be harmful to the female body hopefully i was helpful,NOT
there are certain occupations which are not considered as suitable due to cultural norms these are the ones where women are underrepresented as per the cultural norms women are believed to be caring and tender this is one of the reasons why women occupy significant share in nursing primary teaching human resources how is this about an individuals choice its a much larger question of how society thinks of gender roles,NOT
this new wave of feminism were in currently must go towards tackling breaking down gender stereoptypicsl mentalities and try create equality in the ways that men and women are brought up to think thats the new frontier we should stop focusing on the agendas of second or thirdwave feminism and move towards things like creating a society where boys arnt shamed for displayin vulnerability and emotion where girls are taught that they can reach high positions within their work where both men and women take equal responsibilty over paternal and domestic duties break down gender roles is what im saying its all about how we think now the wage gap is thing of the past and a myth in todays work place im saying this as a feminist ranting and raving about it is only detracting from other work place injustices that women and men encounter feminism isnt dead theres still so far to go but the wage gap just isnt relevant today in the western world love your average local feminist x,NOT
the weight loss wont happen in  weeks thats unlikely but if you keep at it you will start to see change,NOT
ok first of all dont listen to the bullshit pseudoscience out there raw diets hclf etc i highly recommend unnatural vegan she backs up all her claims with science and evidence make sure youre eating plenty of tofu legumes nuts and seeds find what works for you supplement for nutrients that will be hard to get such as iron calcium and b go to the doctor after two weeks and have a blood test and a check up and see how youre doing good luck,NOT
this is so amazing trish start watching tons of vegan youtube videos you need to educate yourself do not i repeat do not count your calories eat a low fat high carb diet i promise you will have amazing results give it some time like all things good things take time,NOT
the ratio of women to men in my mechanical engineering class was  dont get me wrong that one girl could put most of us to shame she was a very hard worker but that ratio is still insane with that said it was the opposite ratio for people taking nursing its just the way it is people have free choice they choose,NOT
keep it up freelee keep making videos to inspire the world to do the right thing you are amazing keep pushing through it xxx,NOT
so does this finally settle that boys r faster and stronger than girls,NOT
minute  you say that men earn k on average while women earn  less at k hope it was an honest mistake and not trying to sound more alarming than it already is the correct answer is  less,NOT
stresso depresso activate,NOT
youre such a bitch i fuckin love you,NOT
its really good and useful video for people who dont know about veganism im from russia and i can say that nowadays a lot of people starting to support vegan diet in my country,NOT
great video vox well presented and neutral in its stance,NOT
theyre brave just different from everyone,NOT
muscles glistening in the wind blaire white  i love you so much thank you for this response to trisha we were all hanging out for it ,NOT
transgender and black hopeless for any girl on the track,ABU
day  feeling amazing so far so good ,NOT
you were just eating chips on your snap storyand they werent vegan,NOT
i appreciate trisha for doing this and applaud her for it why because the more big names like her and sam smith that do this for attention the faster the general public gets sick and tired of this trend it needs to die once and for all,NOT
some people would rather have a job that makes them happy than one where they get paid a lot of money and have a fancy title i dont think its more complicated than that,NOT
good lord please dont premote freelee worst person ever,ABU
this is amazing,NOT
 those are the opposite hahahahahaah,NOT
girl what the hell,NOT
oh look she has the same hairstyle same clothes and same nails as in the june favourites video,NOT
ho lee shit the day has come omg this is amazing,NOT
 micdrop of the century,NOT
i would go vegan but i love chicken too much but kudos to anyone who is vegan,NOT
this isnt sexism its common sense perfect,NOT
i work with a pretty heavy amount of women and they all make as much if not more than i do they also tend to do things like smoke breaks more often constantly using their phones constantly needing to leave midwork to go deal with their children,NOT
its funny to think about that when people arent killing each other in war they occupy their minds with this sort of thing like the wage gap isnt that big of a deal at all ill explain why i said that later the only reason this is going on is that in the modern world we lack the stimuli from tragedic events we as a species are used to so we have to come up with our own and im not saying that women arent discriminated at all but so many people misses to understand the fact that things have never been better its naive to say that the patriarchy is behind all of this when in fact in the last decades we have been moving so much forward in this field it isnt as simple as to just move forward from the way of thinking that men are superior because in the past that was true due to physical attributes that were necessary ie hunting and warfare the way of life we have now is so small portion of the human history that its almost idiotic to say that women have it bad so my point is that it is important to drive equality forward but please understand that it isnt an overnight thing but hey what do i know im a straight white male from a country that was one of the first to give women right to vote and has already had a female president,NOT
this is all evidence towards that women are earning less because of their work place decisions not because of a apparent societal stigma against woman,NOT
the wage gap is fake feministsautistic screeching,NOT
men shop themselves around more often especially early in their career women are far more likely to stay i their first job for longer while men are more likely to check the help wanted sections or hire a headhunter to try to find a higher paying job men are also more likely to ask for bigger raises at the end of the year the company isnt going to just give you a big raise every year if you dont ask when you compare men and women with similar everythingsimilar education similar years experience and a similar philosophy on work either both men and women who shop themselves around and change jobs frequently or both men and women who are content with their first job then the wage gap disappears entirely in fact then women get a few cents more,NOT
there is no wage gap just an earnings gap also pay discrimination is illegal,NOT
waitbut if women are paid less wouldnt that mean that theyd be the majority cause theyre less money i may be wrong,NOT
the statistic you start out with covers all jobs not just harvardtype office jobs please include the jobs that are more physically demanding dangerous it healthimpacting because those are also in the original statistic and are done mostly by men men will do these jobs because a they pay more and b they are trying to support the women in their lives truck driving construction mining firefighting policing mechanic jobs and so on may have some representation by women but it tends to be small women tend to want the safe clean office jobs but who built the office buildings and got paid well for doing the rougher job in the end black lung disease is a male disease and men make up for a disproportionate share of workplace fatalities because they are trying to earn good money for their families and then they get dinged for earning more how heartless can you get,NOT
id be pissed if i was a woman which bu the way is impossible seeing as im a man and i had to compete with men in a womans race,NOT
she needs a psychiatrist,NOT
tldr the fact that its fake,NOT
she transitioned from female to idiotoh no wait she was born that way my bad,ABU
the reason this question is much more controversial than it should be is because of this is there a gender gap yes this is a  undeniable truth and we have the statistics to back it up men do earn more than women this is the reality but the controversy is not about the fact that it exists  but the reason to it and as the video clearly states this gap exist more due to the career choices men and women make than an evil men conspiracy there will always be a gender gap and sometimes it will swing in one way and sometimes another because we are all individuals are women stupid for choosing a career they enjoy no women tend to work to live while men tend to live to work and that makes the women far more intelligent in my book that said would love to see more women in my field embedded programming ,NOT
this is nonsensical most co emissions come from fossil fuels not methane from cows why are you coming after dairy when milk is a superfood we need animal fats for health,NOT
our lord and savior,NOT
wage gap only existed in the early s but it also had child labor and even than the gap is a misconception,NOT
there really isnt a wage gap the thing people call a wage gap is actually an earnings gap when you compare women and men who do the same job work the same hours make the same sacrifices to their social life and family the gap shrinks to so close to equal you could never tell the difference,NOT
were the scientists who composed this wage gap study undergrads or something,NOT
doesnt change any bodythey cant get periods or carry pregnancy using black people for this as baitis shockingom my god,ABU
she is womansplaining triggered,NOT
shes definitely not trans lol,ABU
baby steps i feel like youre doing it all in one go and you have a lifetime of habits to change in order to fully transition give yourself a chance i think that making good lifestyle choices like picking the right products to consume over food that is bad for your body is a great thing i wish your reasons were less superficial but then again we are guilty of that in my opinion changing your diet around like this should be more about what you enjoy eating that is good for your body and soul which doesnt always mean that you need to become vegan it is entirely possible to live a vegan lifestyle but the lack of nutrients that you get from animal products may affect you in the long run you should consider yourself lucky if it happens sooner than that so that you can try something else until you find something that works for you lastly the argument we were never supposed to eat animal product is bullocks honestly just look at the structure of your teeth front teeth are sharperedged to tear into meat easier the back teeth are from grinding your food until you are able to swallow which also aids your digestion herbivores aka vegans of the animal kingdom have flatdull teeth because flora and fauna do not require the shredding action of sharper teeth i hope this is helpful in any way and if i may ask please do not follow all of freelees dietary advice especially not because it works for her and shes super skinny now she has no training or education on this subject at all please consult a physician and a dietitian to figure out what foods you should eat and which you should avoid according to your body type and the current state of your health i highly recommend this last part you should always seek professional advice from certified practitioners tldr freelee is full of shit eat the health foods that you genuinely enjoy talk to an actual doctor and an actual dietitian,NOT
freelee is gonna have a field day over this,NOT
i was worried that there would be an obvious political slant but im happy to say this is quite fair in its analysis of one part of the pay gap,NOT
i felt bad eating a burrito while watching this,NOT
she is right about one thing women do work less than men due to children and stuff buts thats only natural if you look at it men would face the same thing if they took more of a house husband role too so the wage gap is basically created because women just take care of children more,NOT
shes obviously very confused,NOT
honey i recently got into a twitter fight with a non binary retard saying they were trans and were saying that youre transphobic i just these ppl i just cant blaire i fucking cant,ABU
its one thing if youre transgender and want to be left alone but its another thing if youre transgender and want to run shit and tell others what should be done fuck you guys,ABU
slay queen also the kitty is adorable,NOT
there is a pay gap but gender is only one of many components amongst geographic location social class colour ethnicity age etc etc,NOT
if i block this channel will i stop seeing these stupid ass videos on ads,NOT

this is the equivalent to someone coming out as transracial lol,ABU
i need to get more into activism i tried it out this year  will be all about being active for the animals and environment,NOT
everything being said in this video is just no no no no no,NOT
lmao i was watching a colab she did with shane last night and she was saying she dosent like vegan and today i woke up to this,NOT
this makes me think about my years in high school i dont know how many times i was called gay for being into singing and theatre instead of football or baseball maybe im gay lol,NOT
the other side of it is this in texas a young transman was forced to compete as birthsex female this person was hormonally transitioned into a male and its stupid and dishonest to say hormone therapy doesnt change your sex characteristics everything will change what you ended up with was the image of a young man with a young girl in a chokehold this young man had begged to compete against men and was not allowed they made him wrestle girls you can look at it and see its wrong this is also very clearly wrong neither side has this right but i stand flatly in the truth that in the binary the conservative position is always always always patently more stupid,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap is that there isnt any this gender gap myth doesnt take into effect hours worked type of job full time part time also the fact that women dont particular do the same jobs as men and if they do they dont work as long as men do women like nurturing and office roles that are best suited for them you know jobs that are not particularly dangerous no women out there are gonna break their back doing a real man job like construction just ask any sensible women and if they say they do theyre lying simple as that,NOT
this is a woman saying this meaning feminists are people who want money,ABU
i a d o r e trisha but hunny wtf,NOT
the only thing i wanna see is higher pay towards education that would be a cool thing to see,NOT
is she saying she identifies as a male in order to help her cope with the fact it might be impossible for her to have kids which is something thats devastated her for years,NOT
this is the manner of small thinking that make parents think that their boys are girls because they like the color pink,NOT
im so proud trisha i been vegan for over  months now and i lose fat and gain muscle you can do this girl wish the best of luck btw love your daddy issue music video cant wait for the upcoming music videos ,NOT

that thumbnail though lmao but im happy for you,NOT
im a sub now that your a vegan,NOT
hahahahahahahahaaaha you corrupt elephants know nothing,NOT
theyre right there is a lot that people miss about the gender wage gap such as men are more likely to work overtime men are less likely to take sick days even when sick men are less likely to use their vacation days men are more likely to ask for raises and more things there are reasons the wage gap exists and its not just sexism,NOT

five hours websites government websites job workplace statistics motivational wage seminars and learning about economics vox has proven they cant even get basic journalism right to prove a theory to be correct you have to research it to be false and harshly this is the scientific method id like this to be correct however if your numbers experiment yields unfair able results guess what it isnt real its a earnings gap and it isnt sexist its about individual choices and the core belief of equal opportunity not equality of outcome if you stick with a narrative over the evidence youre an ideological individual,NOT
mommytang watch her videos ,NOT

i think women that are married and have children should be prepared to loose out on some money maybe stop being so selfish for a moment and think about the bigger picture youre a family the child needs a mother especially in the early years to take care and nurture said child if you dont want kids and want to pursue your career go ahead then you will earn as much as your male colleagues,ABU
i just cant stop rolling my eyes i mean come on of course she isnt going to stay vegan after  weeks she loves meat have you ever seen any of her mukbang videos im not hating im just over this because its the biggest click bait i have ever seen trisha girl lets be real here if your main reasons are for aesthetics then its just dumb any ,NOT
update us snapchat updates,NOT
yet another package of nonsense from vegans who lack the most rudimentary understanding of nutrition and biochemistry  minutes in and not a single mention of nutrients in vegan foods vs animal foods no substance just more emotionallymanipulative propaganda that knownothings will get behind as if it changes the fact that theyre on a starvation diet lol,NOT
i love you based mom,NOT
vox now what i always ask my self watching these videos how is it that house and child care is considered a burden but income generation an opportunity there is no evidence that this in any way reflects actual attitudes towards both occupations in fact it is rather the opposite so why is it always preented this way,NOT
falon fox all over again whats next ronnie coleman in a bikini as a female bodybuilder,ABU
everyone is hating and the only reason i watched this is because my friend was hating on it but i feel like i relate to this so much i love you t,NOT

the ironic part is if we shift to a vegan diet we will kill ourselves of malnutrition,NOT
im a leftist and i agree the gender wage gap is a myth ever since  its been against the law to pay someone less because of their race or gender,NOT
wage gap exists just on a much smaller scale an easy thing to do to fix it maternitypaternity leave,NOT
just a well made video the editing was fantastic the woman in the video was great for the roll very nice,NOT
i would recommend the vegan corners channel they have great fast recipes that are super helpful just remember if you feel hungry go ahead and eat more as calories from plants arent as dense as those from animals products you can have big meals and not feel guilty im so happy youve decided to follow a plant based diet and i hope you feel the difference immediately d,NOT
thank you for calling this out trish is not untouchable,NOT
this is so wrong on so many levels why are the parents not talking about how the transgender did actually try to race the on the boys track team and didnt do well and that is why they went to the girls track team,NOT
im so sorry you have to deal with all this hate youtube is vicious and im sorry theyll never understand you t sexuality and gender is more fluid than you think its okay to explore yourself to try on different labels or even give them up entirely i wish this world was more accepting of differences and nonconformity but its just not and whoever reads this i dont care what youve seen or how youve justified your actions you cant say with honesty that hate and making fun is a good thing belittling someone when theyre pouring out their soul no matter how foolish you think it sounds is a good thing making not only t but other viewers who are struggling with their own identity feel like absolute crap is a good thing when you spread hate and intolerance into this world its on you thats your fault thats your soul being chipped away at and i hope one day you can overcome your mistakes and spread positivity instead,NOT

in this comment section youll find teenage boys who didnt watch the whole video and blindly associate wage gap with tumblr feminism ,NOT
she wont last a day,NOT
feminist that dont actually want womens rights and only want to boost their ego make it look like that the gender wage gap is a huge thing which it is but they overexxagerate and oversimplify it which makes it harder to understand for people who dont know about it,NOT
whats stupid about this video is that it only analyzes upper class jobs business sector jobs with  salaries are not at all representative of the wage gap the wage gap exists because working class and middle class jobs of particularly male predominate labor have traditionally been unionized steel workers plumbers electricians factory operators traditionally female jobs have not and theyre almost all in the service sector im sure there are some social sexist reasons for that ironically as traditional masculine jobs are being outsourced abroad both men and women are today left with low paying jobs without a history of unionization thats a big reason why wages have been so stagnant for  years i dont write the news folks i just report it,NOT
whos going to cover the choice of less paying jobs in detail  this video becomes a failed attempt,NOT
well it is true women get paid the same but why is the unemployment line in my area  male and why is it that businesses are refusing to hire a male who meets the qualifications that the employer is asking for and instead hiring a female right out of high school who does not meet the requirements also why is it that the average female here has as many as  jobs when the male can not even find one no matter how hard they look the answer because business are being required to hire a female over a male and oh yea lets not forget the homelessness ratio which happens to be yea you guessed it  male why because they can not get jobs,NOT
yasssss trisha yass im so proud of you,NOT

 what does this snake oil merchant have to say about meatbloodorgans centered diet cultures the lies the god damn lies and that effing mcgregor liar does he admit processed tofu causes cancer when produced like processed meat,NOT
but arent women taught from a young age to go into more nonstem majors you cant blame women for not making the right choice when theyre told from a young age they would be bad at it not to mention there are plenty of horror stories of sexism and sexual harassment which must be pretty daunting for any woman choosing to go into a male dominated field its the responsibility of men and women to be respectful and empower each other not be gatekeepers and stereotype based on stupid statistics,NOT
while this is interesting and recontextualizes things neatly youve gotta wonder why literally all statistics show that women earn less even if its not as big a gap as is usually mentioned we went from  to  is uplifting but its also still  plus all the data you mention talks about women in positions of relative privilege soof course they have it less bad than the average woman does,NOT
this conveniently leaves off how men often are demanded of higher hours more risks more time away from family etc the parts where you complain about woman taking more household roles and losing hours tends to be where the men of the family pick up extra hours and more responsibility at work the messed up part is often time woman expect men to do this in families so the men start making way more than the woman and then when there is an apparent pay gap this kind of video gets made saying oh the poor woman are getting paid less complain all you want its just simple woman do less and get paid less and men are being worked to death for that higher pay maybe sometime vox should do something about how men are getting shafted by this trend too,NOT
yeh yeh yeh whatever be vegan for the animals or gtfh,NOT
boy i need to work for vox,NOT
but then these idiots come back with well the patriarchy keeps women from choosing what they want ,ABU
gosh society have became stupid,ABU

i think trish could do it she just needs a lot of support and someone to keep her going,NOT
i like how they choosed a female to host so we take it seriously since most women are obviously bias and stubborn on the subject,NOT
this is because women want to become equals with men please send these men to the olympics and lets see how these feminists react just what they wanted and yeah please let them use womens bathroom and showers please  reality check,ABU

i really dislike when people say theyre going to do something and then not do it girl your snap just had fried chicken and waffles of course youre not going to upload that on youtube because people are going to hold you accountable and i find it hard to believe you dont have a problem with it you were never going vegan you were trying to go plant based you obviously dont care about animals or anything really unsubscribing,NOT
i love vegan drivethrus nobody ever,NOT
studies showwww that  of like peopllllle afflicted with like vocal fryyyyyye are like womennnn,NOT
i have come up with a sure fire plan to end the wage and male white privilege gap all people are declared male its pretty easy to do in canada ask lauren southern of rebel media then just check the white box it doesnt matter if you arent that race ask rachel dolezal sp and shaun king they identified as black but when discovered that they really arent black they identify as transblack so everyone should just say they are male and transwhite easy no wage gap and everyone is privileged ,NOT

please watch the unnatural vegan especially her video on raw til ,NOT
support my page please much love,NOT
the reason why they dont hire women in critical position is because they do not know how to make critical decisions never hire a women,ABU
it is true that businesses pay people who are on call and willing to work longer hours more money i remember working at this popular fast food place in america as a legal immigrant and i got a higher hourly wage than the other workers because i was willing to work later than the americans and i did things the americans would not do as an immigrant i got a higher pay than other male workers and female workers and it was all because of the quality of work i put in before i left america the manager even promised an even higher hourly wage if i decided to come back people pay quality workers more money,NOT
sis are you  at this point you can really tell she is doing this on purpose,NOT
well to answer her question why business wouldnt just hire women if theyre paid less i assume that there are a number of reasons for that the most important one is probably that a lot of male company ceos consider women to be less qualified or reliably so theyre willing to hire men instead even if they cost more also the video presents the information rather misleadingly for example she says that the adjusted gender wage gap is the result of choices of the women and that she wants to look at those choices but she immediately switches back to the nonadjusted wage gap reasons that gives the impression of her explaining why the adjusted wagegap is incorrect while she actually just explains the nonadjusted wage gap the adjusted wagegap is still somewhere between  to  and even if it would be just  then the question would be still there why women should be fine with earning  less than men and why are so many guys in the comment section wanting so badly the gender wage gap not to exist what would you lose if everybody would be paid equally for the same work,NOT
if theres no wage gap then why does my girlfriend make more than me haha checkmate prager ,NOT
wage gap is a debunked myth,NOT
there is  million known species on earth at a rate of  species getting extinct per day that mean at some point in  there will be  species left on earth  thank god we are all going to die in  year it mean no one is going to be there to see that sad moment,NOT

theyre missing that it doesnt exist,NOT
this iswhat crazy looks like huh,NOT
it is not a fad  omg gurl noooo it is not non binary gender fluid pan bi asexual all of them people thought were fads there not fads  that isnt to say some people wont go around saying they are something they are not for clout reasons and if they do do that that is indeed disgusting but gender and sexuality and orientation which yes are all very different things but as a sexual psych major i feel its my duty to inform you that these things are ligit real and that that gender identity as well as orientation sexual preferences is a far much more wider spectrum then we all initially realized and she might just not know what she is or where she actually falls because shes still in that process of self discovery again i m not very familar with her channel or the trolling to know for sure if thats the case and if it is ya its disgusting to do that for attention,NOT
finally freelee can sleep easy for  weeks she can stop being bitter,NOT
its almost always a dumb statement when someon uses a number over a  then say per cent,NOT
its being said by a woman therefore it must be true,NOT
can you identify as a transgender identifying as a transgender xd,NOT
i am here to read the comment section ,NOT
the  cents gap can also relate to maternity leave from the job the wage gap is that a myth it was outlawed in ,NOT
oh my god wages and earnings are different you keep comparing earnings and calling it wage difference they are two different things women earn less due to their job choicevacation timeraising kidsmaternity leave by working less hours if they didnt they would earn the same amount maybe go back  years and look at the equal pay act of  where you already achieved your goal its like beating in a dead horse jesus christ,NOT
this woman is now my hero,NOT
why arent men just kicked out work beacuse you can pay women less ,ABU
ok so it seems that since woman choose to take on more extra responsibilities that they dont have to take on they cant work as much getting less pay fair,NOT
cant agree with more audi made a  super bowl commercial regarding this gender wage gap issue i decided to boycott audi after watching it i cant do much but i do what i can to show my disagreement with their lie,NOT
facts are sexist,NOT
yes lets force women to make the choices feminists want them to make,NOT
zucchini noodles  spaghetti squash the best,NOT
so it turns out vox is actually retarded,ABU
those real girls dont have a chance right now i hope this doesnt interfere with college scholarships,ABU
the wage gap is not a thing its simply comparing the average earnings of all women to the average earnings of all men it doesnt take into account hours worked over time holiday pay time taken off different jobs job positions it is not about gender it is not sexist,NOT
ps the video you made is a joke,ABU
its scary what is it send help,NOT
i really dont understand why you do youtube anymore,NOT
i dont dress girly so i must be a man gender expression is not the same as gender identity,NOT
it reminds me of the greatest duo in tennis history brothers serena and venus williams their biceps say all,NOT
thank you for educating me,NOT
go watch vegan gains video,NOT
why do men and women make different career choices whyyy is it so hard to ask yourself this question,NOT
you video is very informative and truthful however i think you are missing the point its not about attempting to understand what is really going on they are not interested in that its about having a complaint regardless of whether it is legit backing it with some carefully crafted statistics andor research and repeating the complaint over and over and over until they get what they want which is never enough so they repeat the above because it works enough times and so they feel empowered and self righteous it is a mental disorder really,NOT
or you could just betrish youre a female but doesnt mean you have to act girly,NOT
freelee probably going comment on this but i love trish congrats going vegan,NOT
everyone listen to jackb  most womens lifetime priorities are for the sustaining and nurturing of future generations  ie their children grandchildren etc which exacts a toll in time and strength being a working mom is such a pressure that most the wiser women would choose jobs that would not interfere that much with their maternal activities and routines thus less work time done more time for the young uns and the husbandlover to boot hehehehehehehe i mean that gap is not even that bad youre right its just the effect of the priorities that women have visavis that of men kudos,NOT
wholefood plant based vegan lifestyle for the win ,NOT
also if u crave junk food tons of junk food is vegan not good for you but vegan lol them salt and vinegar chips u love oreos twizzlers dairy free ben and jerrys takis many cereals monsters spicy sweet chili doritos popcorn and the list goes on forever just google it  love you,NOT
anyone else think this clearly shows that trisha has no friends she can talk with and get other perspectives,NOT
work more hours and the wage gap disappears thats pretty obvious considering the only reason the wage gap was a thing was because on average women tend to work less at lower paying jobs not because theyre paid less for equal work,NOT
i am so happy im vegan,NOT
im so happy for you good luck,NOT
though this is offensive for me personally she is acting her entire channel was based on her acting so this video was of her acting,NOT
i am more masculine in my day to day life i like cars i like building things i like to chill with no make up big baggy shirts i like reptiles and bugs i collect skulls but i am a woman im a tomboy big deal people are becoming so confused with their own sexuality and gender because of the fad that being lgbt has become trisha is not trans and turning it into a click bait joke is foul,NOT
but nevermind smh,NOT
what about oppotunities not given to women because one day maybe who knows they can get pregnant even if you dont have children and you dont want to have them,NOT
finally the bulk of child care even within in a marriage is still traditionally placed on the women in the partnership and not the man although as women outperform men in college education see another prager u essay perhaps more men will stay at home with the children and work the less demanding jobs,NOT
how is this not common sense,NOT
if it quakes like a duckwaddles like a duck and has physical advantages over females what is it        its a transgender duck,NOT
im really happy to learn that youre at least giving it a try you really deserve huge kudos for this,NOT
im pretty sure that she made the video with her shirt tucked lopsided,NOT
this is vodka by the way bruh that sent me,NOT
listen i get it yall r offended but we r telling her the exact same shit a lot of us where told when we tried to come out yall dont know whats goin through her head so please stop pretending you do ,NOT
theres still a huuge gap if you look up how much the employees earn per hour pluswomen also dont get promoted as easily as man and the wage gap during their child rearing years just shows how the market is unfriendly towards mothers who want to work and take care of their children at the same timeim talking about what they learn per hour working mothers are seen as women denying their responsibility of child rearing however its the opposite for working fathers they receive empathy from their bosses and have a higher wage than average men but what if the working mother is a single mom how is she supposed to raise her children alone and earning half of what a man earns per hour this video is also very misleading and disappointing even if you say that its only temporaryin other developed countrieslike japanthe wage gap actually widens even more after the thirtiesand reaches its peak at fifties and years of reduced make a huge difference on a womans life we should stop trying to excuse ourselves and start working on solving the problem we created,NOT
does this mean jason nash is gay,NOT
dont be afraid of cooked foods especially if you want to go longterm and not fall off it definitely recommend vegan tacos made with chick peas and rice and salsa they are amazing i also like to add bell peppers,NOT
i support you but im completely lost,NOT
lmao trisha is playing tf outta yallthat video was pre recorded and shes been eating like shit ever since,NOT
thanks again these are great im looking forward to watch them every year amazing amazing job pbn cant wait for the  one when its all gonna be about how the dairy industry goes under i call it,NOT
your body will b the fucking bomb and you will love all the great things so healthy,NOT
this is surprisingly neutral its a refreshing change,NOT
this doesnt account the type of job that men and women choose,NOT
hahahaha omg hahaha i love the crap that abc news takes out hahaha omg,NOT
dont scroll down the comment section is antifeminists who didnt watch the video and are copy and pasting their revolutionary wagegap arguments despite the video kind of addressing the wage gap different jobs and earnings issue you have been warned,NOT
i hate this video but yall have to admit shes looking physically healthier ,NOT
veganism is good for numerous reasons but you cannot expect a body transformation in  weeks your body might retain some of the food you are eating since youve been starving yourself  naturally more water weight because the fruits  foods you will be eating naturally have more liquid you will definitely probably see results in your skin recommend foods potatoes  they will keep you full for a long time  dont have any fat instead of frying bake them  put spices on it  find a low fat sauce you can dip them in if youd like frozen smoothies in the morning just buy those frozen mix of fruits you see at the supermarket blend with a bit of water or almond milk  maybe some vanilla i wish you the very best on your vegan journey ,NOT
after two weeks i recommend just taking out red meats then when you are accustom to that take out birds chicken and turkey then after that cut out fish followed by other animal by products im only a vegetarian so i cant help with animal byproducts but take it slow because cutting it all out at once is extremely difficult not saying you cant and not saying people dont i just couldnt personally do it best of luck to you girl im so proud of you and the influence youre giving off,NOT
about the acne breaks i got the same problem but ive been drinking water like crazy everyday and i find so much diference of my skin quit the soda quit juices not  natural ones of course dont drink too much coffee my skin never looked so good like now ,NOT
i was waiting for this fuck i wish i brought snacks,NOT
its a man with a wig and make up,ABU
does anyone else get emotional over these yearly reviews,NOT
considering that paying a women less because they are a woman is illegal the lack of lawsuits is selfevident to the existence of a wage gap,NOT
trisha is the type to go vegan publicly in front of the whole world and stuff her face with burgers and hot dogs while alone in her room,NOT
if this video took a look at if there was equal opportunities for women to actually get the higher paying jobs i think the consensus that prageru came to would have been different,NOT
lentils beans nuts tofu lots of rice and pasta and as much fruits and vegetables,NOT
as a straight guy i can testify that theres nothing hotter than lesbians making out does that make me a trans lesbian,NOT
well women are better at multitasking and taking care of children resulting in lower paying jobs like taking care of their own children or being a teacher or a waitress and men are generally stronger and can focus on one thing better resulting in better jobs like engineering these are just natural born instincts and so if a women has a job that men can kind of do better the quality of work might be less than a mans quality of work resulting in being paid less i dont know this for a fact but i think that is a possibility right,ABU
freelee secretly has the biggest heart look at how happy she is she just wants the best for everyone,NOT
hell yeah vox is smart again,NOT
suzy amis is  years old and looks like she is an  year old cancer patient i wouldnt take any health advice from her,NOT
u guys need to relax,NOT
dont you feel ashamed to say this as a woman,NOT
lets just say without feeling ashamed men are better than women when it comes to getting work done male brain is more logical and focused thats why they are good with machines and computers whereas female have a random  acc to me its confusing mindset thought pattern and they prefer jobs require less mental work and risk its not like women are less than men its just the nature both are different women can be a substitute to a men but she cant be a men,ABU
if u want a frappe get soy milk or coconut and no whip cream you can do this ive been vegan for  year today sp proud of you and peanut butter dates and tofu have lots of protein put them in smoothies and its easy to bloat at first but it will go down its important to eat enough to get your b vitamin in you and if you dont you could feel sick and non energized if you are doing things right you should feel more energized love you good job you go girl,NOT
they should just make a trans league they will know what even competition is,ABU
so shes on snapchat and instagram eating chicken and waffles,NOT
crash dieting is so bad for you again you are rambling and speaking way too fast,NOT
trish i seriously commend you on being open minded enough to give something like this a go not only will you feel great inside and out and look even better then you do now you will also be helping the animals and our environment i have been watching you for so long now and i didnt think i could become a bigger fan love you girl ,NOT
all of the feminists saying that there is a gender wage gap then proceeding to tell you that gender is a social construct,NOT
los polticos como pedro snchez quedan como autnticos subnormales cuando hablan de la brecha salarial,NOT
these are my two favorite youtubers and i am so proud and happy trisha finally became vegan and they are getting along i love veganism its amazing for you and every other living things,NOT
why do feminists think a career is more important than a happy family,NOT
prageru amazing logic and evidence based content until they bring up jesus then they resort to fallacies and fairy tales,NOT
it doesnt exist thats what people are missing,NOT
how can a vegan get b if b supplement comes from animals,NOT
in my feminist country tge wage gap is reveseman paid less for the same joband this one is true the survey was very well constructed idk how it is in dollars but a women get  when guys get  this is unfair and there is no man movement herecause we dont care we want the best for our females unlike the feminists that wants the worst for manwe dont have any kind of feminism and everybody like happily here,ABU
does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didnt watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work eg business this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men  women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesnt account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from    men earned more out the gate  its a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from  all the way back to  i mean really  the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their s and s was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument  if you look at women born  same thing for women    if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument   these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women arent payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument   if you dont show up for work or cant work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesnt have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her  i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in  so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women arent paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they werent but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women the simple answer is no,NOT
yeah feminists so stfu haha jk but seriously still stfu,NOT
trish youre always slaying,NOT
i was about to dislike the video before even watching it but i found out that i actually agree with everything mentioned in this video,NOT
are any of you guys vegan when the people you live with arent im a vegetarian now but i really want to become vegan i just think itd be so hard when youre living with other people that eat meat dairy etc,NOT
wait people still believe in the wage gap myth this has been debunked more times than i can remember and anyone who spends more than  seconds thinking about it will realize why on average men work more hours and work in the higher paying and more dangerous fields omg sexism men make up  of workplace deaths omg omg omgomg sexism if men complained as much as feminists,NOT
milo was right all along,NOT
i know you are trying to loose weight but as like a guilty pleasure there are many vegan chips and stuff lays original chips are vegan carbs are your best friend to fuel your body vegan pastas potatoes low sodium foods will help because salt causes bloating eating a lot of fruit will help but you will need more than you have since fruit wont be as filling as other foods,NOT
just like how i dont like people telling me which religion is right i dont like people telling me what to eat,NOT
their not female accept the fact people have to stop pretending they believe in this stupidity for once and for all their males who want to be females stop calling these people trans gender you cant transition from gender your born with ok their males so why cant they identify as  year olds and compete there its because if the government accepts people saying their in wrong body for age just imagine the uproar anyone could claim to be a pensioner and no one would ever have to work this is why its not accepted to say your in wrong body for age so lets be straight and honest their not females no argument fact you cant change gender fact fact,ABU
does anyone have a good vegan dinner recipe its the only thing i struggle with into my transition to veganism  please be nice thank you ,NOT
if you dislike this video you are ignorant,NOT
breaking news men are better than women,ABU
male bodies are stronger than female bodies nobody is discriminating against anyone its just facts if you ask the teachers coaches and administrators off the record they will tell you they are terrified of trans activists and the left wing media smearing them and destroying their careers how about when it comes to contact sports like martial arts should someone who has years of testosterone building up muscle mass and bone density get in the ring to pummel a biological female,ABU
women live longer than men do and if a woman is married to a man and that man suddenly dies she will be poor so the man has to earn more money during his life time so his wife can inherit some cash after he dies simple as that,NOT
gosh i have to be more educated in this field before i make a stance i will say this is a tough one,NOT
sick this dude thinks hes a woman doesnt mean he is he needs to compete with his own body build and gender and see how well he does in an equal competition,ABU
shes eating fried chicken and waffles right nowfeel bad for torturing chickens my butt,NOT
im all for equal pay for equal work but heres my  cents from the computer science field i work in a group of ish people  if you extrapolate to the other subgroups working with us among all of them  are women one does pure managing one does pure testing and that leaves a single woman actually writing or designing code  even then i have to personally coach her so she can write proper code theres sexism and theres objective data ill leave you the role of finding which i just used,NOT
im actually crying bbbbihhhhh im so proud of you trishhhhy,NOT
lol let me race against the women shit lol idc your born a boy you will have to compete against them lol your body is already has an advantage against women lol we physically stronger come on lol this bs lol if you cant beat the men dont go change your shit so you can compete,ABU
so i identify myself as what these people in the comments seem to hate and villainize a feminist it is true that the myth has been debunked but you still have to acknowledge that women recieve much more obstacles to the path of a successful career then there are safety issues attached with the working late hours also childbirth is a major reason for women to compromise on their careers regardless the wage gap is a myth and its a little known idea we need to spread the word,NOT
potatoes nuts and there are plenty of recipes everywhere online ,NOT
thank god some women are neutral and arent full on feminists and hate men,ABU
this is the first time that i cant tell if shes trolling or being serious wanting to identify as both isnt trans hun this sounds more like gender fluid or nonbinary if this is how you truly feel or you can just be a tomboy who likes pink im a tomboy who likes girly things at times idk i just dont wanna put anything in your head you have to sit down with yourself and really think about it this is your own journey and you need to figure it out yourself,NOT
it isnt sexism its just common sense ,NOT
check out adelaide by bike in winter coast ,NOT
wtf is up with her lips,NOT
remember u can still have starbucks just ask for coconut milk instead of dairy ,NOT
im so proud of you and dont worry no one is perfect there will be times where you might backslide and eat something nonvegan sometimes even on accident things we might think are vegan turn out not to be the point is dont quit dont get discouraged ignore the negative people and focus on the people that want to support you and see you succeed youre beautiful inside and out and you deserve the happiest and healthiest life you can lead,NOT
trisha was eating meat on her snapchat story not even  hours ago,NOT
just out of curiosity i wonder what the wage gap is like for jobs involving a lot of physical labor ,NOT
i cant get over how pretty blaire looks in this video,NOT
what a sickness hormone therapy she is not a she and they are black,ABU
please just get a lot more food than that if you dont eat enough itll be easy for you to fall back and cave into your non vegan cravings ,NOT
i think youre a tucute and misinformed on transgender people,NOT
i dont understand is this trix person a female or male,NOT
trisha is always a big troll and trolls with controversial topics this isnt new lol,NOT
i despise most social workers they only help women and condemn innocent men,ABU
sis when u said u were on ur kitchen floor i lost my sheeeeeiiiittttttt,NOT
why dont you just go on a diet and shut the fuck up,ABU
hey trish here are some of my suggestions posting this before finishing the videohummus and crackers avocado seasoned and with lemon and sriracha on brearice with basically any of your favourite additions mexican style or asian style ex beanscornjalepenos  almond milk and muesli with fruit ontopdates as a snackwatermelon juice,NOT
dose of reality,NOT
definitely try gardeins meatless fish nuggets and meatless chicken nuggets i was able to eat vegan for a week because of those products ,NOT
wut bout non carrer jobs like fast foodretail jobs,NOT
how hard could it be to have an apples to apples comparison base pay rate comparison of same profession of same company male vs female,NOT
thank you this is a well made well researched video no yelling screaming or basing anything on emotion only the facts this should end the argument to anyone with half a brain ,NOT
boys will be boys period,ABU
it is truly fair to exclude them from competing in women sports people that say men can be changed into women are plan idiots they can take all the hormones they want in the end they are still male their natural default is male they were born male they should not compete as women it come be the only way for them to win its likely they were losing to makes so hey lets identify as male and compete with women this generation is full of depraved idiotic people,ABU
why would you want to close the wage gap if you dont know the conditions that produce it thats like wanting to close the wage gap between ceos and their gardeners making people more similar for similaritys sake is just pointless,NOT
okay so sam has been out as nonbinary since  but no one cared until they did a recent interview,NOT
yay im so happy for her,NOT
hell yeah vegan  next it is so wonderful to be part of this justice movement,NOT
that it doesnt exist,NOT

im just waiting for vegan gains response video ,NOT
i guess im trans too cause i wish i could pee standing up,NOT
i was on your twitter then you blocked me a while ago i never said anything to you just liked post i dont understand,NOT
i agree with most of the stuff you said in the video but what if there was a huge wage gap on woman on a jobmy good friends mother is working full time as a journalist and is writing news paper for a work time of  hours a day i dont remember the paycheck that she needed to make but lets just say by working  hours she is going to make kshe is working like crazy for hours and she should make k right well right but the problem is her boss  from k she is getting payed a lot less than she should about  she is scared do ask her boss the reason that she gets a low payment because is a little bit hard to find a job in that city i dont know if her boss is sexist or an asshole or even both but that is a huge wage gap and indeed is happening in some reare casesi dont disagree with the video i just want to say that this happens some times and i got as a explaination my friends mother that is based on a reall story oh and sorry for my english ,NOT
hey idk if this is still relevant but if you go to pinterest and search vegan recipes there is a lot of really good stuff but also you should watch raw vegan not gross she has really good recipes and she is so funny and cute and you know what good for you for trying veganism and if it doesnt work out the first time thats okay what worked for me was going vegetarian for a few months and then just deciding fuck it im going vegan and i havent looked back in almost  years,NOT
she is miles better than liz plank,NOT
leafyishere did a video on trisha paytas a while back  now its time for me to do a commentary on it,NOT
shit they even provide the source of information thats a start,NOT
we cant always see her she only lets us see what she puts out imma catch her at burger king and be like i caught you bitvh,NOT
great dont forget to take supplements for b,NOT
you can eat as many fruits and veggies as you want stick to the high carb low fat diet eat all of the fruit pasta veggies bread and cereal as you want until you arent hungry just watch out for the fattier foods like avocado anything like veggie cheese and fake meat good luck trish,NOT
theres a wage gap because of the different choices men and women make not because of discrimination ,NOT
im so proud of you im vegan and i can honestly say it is the best decision ive ever made so excited for you and hope you enjoy your experience,NOT
welcome to the new world order folks,NOT
trish this might be a new chapter in your life xoxo keep going girl ,NOT
this channel is literally just reverse buzzfeed,NOT
wow its almost like women and men are equal but different like biologically women still bear children men still dont and also in their interests and talents crazy no but seriously great video gonna send this to all my feminist friends d,NOT
one thing i ask is if women are payed less why dont more companies hire them to save money i mean wouldnt companies save money also as a female be assertive about the cash you want to fiercely compete with your fellow males it takes time but it works,NOT
wow nonbinaryphobe it existed before  people just didnt have a name for it also do you think that trans people need to take hormones to prove their transness or something thats the height of truscum,NOT
omg weve entered retardville,NOT
i love this woman  ppl like her and thunderft restore my faith in humanity,NOT
imagine trying to be special by saying youre trans but youre not and fetishizing gay men,NOT
guuuurrrlllll finally im so happy for you omg this is so great please make sure you eat in abundance eat until your satisfied and enough so you dont feel bad or sick protein is the easiest macronutrient to get in so dont worry  eat garbanzo beans beans lentils green peas are high in protein too i suggest you to find  foods you really enjoy so it gets easy to get it in your meals  eat lots of fruits and greens too hope you really stay vegan you go girl,NOT
so women really want us to take away their choices fine by me,NOT
i just noticed the like and dislike ratio lol,NOT
the future is vegan,NOT
thisss isss sooo great  thats so amazing im so happy for you,NOT
the wage gap doesnt tell us how long theyve been working there what theyve done or their productivity it just tells us their wages,NOT
mad respect for freelee c,NOT
wait one year out of business school were these people working at the same facility or were they employed by two different companies who pay differently and is it possible that the men strived for higher paying jobs to better support a family hmm i wonder why these studies are so inaccurate also if employers could get away with paying employees less why wouldnt every company hire woman,NOT
having been a vegetarian since over  years this year i wanted to give being a vegan a try and so did veganuary and it was hard at times especially when going to restaurants but i always found alternatives and actually never felt like i was really missing out on anything its all about changing habits and looking for new alternatives so glad that the foodindustry is changing and giving us more options gonna try and continue on my vegan path as best possible simply cause it feels right out of respect to the animals lives and our planet,NOT
i can use your guys help i am really wanting to go vegan but with my life right now i have to get by by only  a month for food so idk if i could be vegan by that budget pleaseeeeee tell me its possible,NOT
trisha needs attention i would understand if she would be in her teens or early twenties but i am her age and i seriously cant believe that at this age she still can do things like that and be considered normal,NOT
so the problem is getting woman into the fields that they want to work in and give them opportunities to choose specialties work more hours etc til theyre making what they want to be making as long as that is achieved thats what matters,NOT
i think communism warned us,NOT
im so excited that youre joining the vegan movement ive been vegan for about  months now and let me just say i feel a lot healthier and happier considering i went through some depression in the last year i have always loved animals and i think that this cause is amazing some tips that i find very useful are to surround your self with food vegan only so if you are ever tempted to go back to the yummy non vegan snacks the only food source you have is vegan food i also recommend looking up lots of youtube channels that do vegan recipes and websites that promote vegan friendly dishes best of luck to you and becoming vegan hopefully you will stay on this diet after the  weeks,NOT
not sure about you lot but im going to go grab a nice big fat juicy beef burger to devour,NOT
i was waiting for this video to come out because yt never ever shows your new videos im so glad i did youre the best ,NOT
you can buy meat free chicken turkey etc,NOT
you are fucking insane you are the reason that transgender people get a bad reputation because people like you convince everyone transphobe that we are all like you trans people are discriminated against every day particularly trans women of color and you are making this video with literally no evidence and no diagnosis of gender dysphoria that medical condition linked with being trans you are a fucking disgrace to the community you claim to be a part of also if you identify  with your assigned gender at birth that completely discredits you being trans,ABU
shes confused why bring her down and bully her just because your story isnt similar to hers yall attack her oh shes looking for attention oh shes being so rude oh so disrespectful get the fuck out of here trish can call herself whatever she wants get the fuck over it i just want to know why everyone is so fucking sensitive its insane to me,NOT
i admit this is confusing as hell what i got from it was women cant work the same hours men can so they earn less so there is a earn gap and not a wage gap,NOT
does anybody know the music they used in the background,NOT
how do you feel about people raising their own cattle to make cheese and eat milk to eat,NOT
freelee is an advocate for veganism i think that is the word you meant love ya trish,NOT
liberals are lying brainwashed idiots,ABU
if you are vegan eat a lot ive been vegan for a year and i eat a lot and im not fat eat rice beans pasta believe you are going to feel better,NOT
these blokes should be in a zoo not racing girls its re dick you less,ABU
girl youre a tomboy not a dude or transgender i dont have many female friends either and i get along with males more because many women are two faced bitches,ABU
so we all need to go to pharmacy school,NOT
yes it hurts it really hurts trisha why the ffff are you comfortable with your tits hips ass voice looks and i cant be why do you get to embrace all of that with this false shirt calling yourself something youre not why do i have to have my mind explode about all the discomforts that consume me and youre totally allowed to just flash all of these things but its okay because guys can have tits too okay get out i sincerely hope she is joking why couldnt i be comfortable,NOT
never going vegan or vegetarian dont  me,NOT
shes literally so ignorant like i want to bang my head against the wall,NOT
its sad that people are comming out for clout and they never come out as gay or lesbian they come out as some made up sexualitygender,NOT
this is clickbait at the end of the video she still admitted that there was a wage gap lol,NOT
im so happy for you sorry but vegans dont use real leather so all your purses will have to be thrown out if you continue to become vegan,NOT
beans for protien also chipsnuts are life,NOT
everyday thousands of innocent plants are killed by vegetarians help stop the violence,NOT
u shouldnt be vegan its unhealthy we all know ur beautiful dont change trish dont do this and freelee looks anorexic,NOT
damn vox back it again with cherry picked statistics,NOT
unleash the vegans go ahead rip into her,NOT
no gender gape,NOT
link this to every feminist who talks about the wage gap,NOT
my biggest tip is if you mess up dont give up its really hard especially at the beginning so if you have a piece of pizza one day dont give up all together you will find it will become so much easier as time goes on and then you will mess up less and less and not even crave any nonvegan food anymore good luck you can do it,NOT
you need greens  lots of fruit and baby kale cuz its not so strong  try jugo juice the mighty kale smoothie  so good so sweet  and eat more than you usually do so u dont binge,NOT
most every thing she said she felt is how i am but to me im like a bisexual tomboy she is full of it,ABU
 men have beat the womens m world record,NOT
first year carnivore plants are out for me the health side promotes plant based not vegan i heard  false statements in this video and stopped watching,NOT
transgenders are not real theyre men and women playing dress up,ABU

so change the way the whole economy works to make our choices which we made freely more profitable gotcha,NOT
trish try the veggie burger from burger king its the shit ,NOT
if just taking some hormones makes it fair then where are the female to male track and field winners,ABU
yes trisha yaaaaaaaas im so happy your giving veganism a try ,NOT
yaaasss oh my goodness trish this is seriously so amazing to hear,NOT
blaire i love you  i watch every time you upload but you cant say someone is or isnt transgender how would you feel if someone told you you werent transgender you cant do that in my opinion,NOT
its a choice that men and women both make on call  missing out on a lot in life dangerous work environment  high risk of death or serious injury work long and late hours  sacrificing time with loved ones and personal time for yourself no disrespect to women but  of them are not willing to do any of that but will complain their not getting paid as much as the person who is men dont do it because its fun we do it because someone has to if you was a employer and had a employee working late hours on a short notice willing to be on call willing to come in on their days off willing to relocate and go out on dangerous work environments wouldnt you want to pay them a bit more then the person who isnt willing to do any of that,NOT
lmao last night on her snapchat she was eating chicken and waffles,NOT
i feel like an idiot for not thinking about this when i was younger scholarships out the ass here i come is what i would have said oh well lmfao  women of this generation are just screwed,NOT
trisha just made a video of her emotionally eating cruel animal products please respond and help her see that it doesnt have to be animal products she eats when shes upset that she can eat whatever plant products and make her feel satisfied and make her feel better,NOT
so proud of you for doing this  i hope you stay with it after your video,NOT
this is unbelieveble i cant be more amazed how every video you make is wrong every one of them when you talk about socialism youre actually explaining populism and dictorship when you talk about how beutiful capitilism is you dont take consideration of the effects that companys have on the majority of the population lives and now you try to make the obvius gap a myth i beg you to stop this propaganda and always start youre videos with the frase this is my opinion if you think your giving valuable info to the population youre absolutly wrong and if you have any second interests you should be ashamed of yourselves stop using this chanel as an true documentery information and make it an opinion one because you clearly have the  of your concepts difinitions absolutly wrong i have no political party and i have wacthed severel videos so i have an objective point of view so dont even try puting me names or cualifyng me as something im not,NOT
i am a feminist i agree with everything in this video which is why if we want to see women on average earning the same as men on average referring to the opening statistic she cited then we need to encourage women to enter certain fields the top  paying majors what this video did not comment on were the reasons women are choosing not entering these fields if the true costs of a certain career are higher for women than for men then of course we will see unequal gender representation in said field by true costs i am referring to the emotional costs of being the lone women or the of facing constant rude comments can take on a person society has a long history of gender roles and it has been a very difficult process for people to breakdown these notions of womens work versus a mans work for example if women who want to become petroleum engineers not only have to obtain all the same degrees and experience as their male counterparts but also have to overcome social and emotional obstacles which men face to a much lesser degree because this field is already seen as a natural fit for men then of course women are not choosing to enter those fields because they wage they would earn does not cover all the costs associated with that career thus they way to close the gap between average female and average male earnings is to make adjustments at a societal level on how we work and interact with one another  attempting to make each professional field an equally valid option for both genders lastly in references to the idea that there is better pay for employees willing to work longer hours or keep more flexible hours the current trend of women choosing jobs or positions with more traditional working hours can be attributed to the fact that women still take on the majority of housework and child rearing responsibilities  so of course they cannot accept positions with irregular or extended hours thus if we want to see women changing the sort of hours they work and thus the level of pay they receive then we need to give men paternity leave and try to equally distribute the burdens or parenthood between the two parents assuming you are lucky enough to have two parents,NOT
does she fucking think before she speaks,NOT
does vox pay their employees equally,NOT
oreo is vegan,NOT
ive been vegan for over  years my biggest fear before i started the diet was my muscle maintenance being a bodybuilder i relied on chicken and fish typical but years later i look much more leaner cleaner and just as strong above that i no longer have joint pains my eczema by my elbow had diminished and i swear you not have never had a stomach pain since its absolutely incredible how eating a plant based diet can be so rejuvenating to the human body will never go backand ive turned many friend onto the dietand they absolutely love it praying for the compounding effect drew follow me on instagram for some food picsevolving body images stay healthy everyone,NOT
 normally doesnt wear make up but likes to glam sometimes nobody literally nobody trisha then i must be a gay trans man,NOT
yay been waiting for a year for this video every year actually ,NOT
ive been vegetarian for almost  years now and i would love to see a video on what your go to foods are in a day i want to go vegan but i havent educated myself enough on what to substitute so i am looking forward to that video you do look amazing and im sure you feel even better ,NOT
i just agreed with a prageru video when is the sky gonna fall,NOT
for those who dont know the only reason trish did this video is because freelee the banana girl paid and pleaded with her to do it you can look at trishs snapchat and see she is not eating a vegan diet freelee is having a severe credibility issue at the moment she has stolen content from small youtubers made false copyright claims on channels to silence them and also recently endorsed eating meat despite claiming to be a vegan she was also recently kicked off instagram for bullying other users all this is online and verifiable please dont fall for freelees nonsense i dont blame trish  cash is cash everyone has got to eat,NOT
im never seen someone who i cant tell is stupid or retarded def a big chunk of both lol,ABU
bae going vegan was the best decision i ever made veggies beans rice potatoes and fruit are staples for me smoothies in the morning with vegan protein powder vega,NOT
though you make a valid point most of the studies done about wage gaps refer to women doing the same job as men and i mean exact same job for the same company so ya know its not just medians and averages though that was alot of the reason the wage gap got so poulour,NOT
i was checking my subscription box when this video played and i was just about to hit the skip button until i heard theres no such thing as wage gap decided to watch till the end and immediately shared in all my social media losing some friends probably,NOT
my wife earns more than me around  more base plus comms were both in sales i work  more hours with almost  years more experience we sell software she gets around  linkedin opportunities a day from global software companies most of their briefings detail that they will only look at female candidates often females under  years of age,NOT
the truth is a microaggression,NOT
i have been one aaall my life you can text me pm and i will tell you some typs to eat plz pm me,NOT
trisha sooo much protein in fruit dont even worry about protein,NOT
good for you trish do what you want im proud of you for trying to change your lifestyle,NOT
bros youre still not that much faster than the real females not great guys not great,ABU
check mommytangs channel youll be happy and satisfied with the vegan diet,NOT
omg i love you so much you dont even understand how happy i am right now  trisha if you ever feel like cheating on the whole health thing there are tons of vegan junk foods just google them but good luck with it this is so good for your soul life is too precious to end up breaded and fried you know life is amazing and beyond our power to create ,NOT
i can definitely show my respect to a well conducted actual research on the topic even if it comes from people with differing political opinions that kind of research is what has to be spread about all topics ideology should stop to be the main point of a party they should rather focus on facts and how to improve the situation using proved methods,NOT
trish youve completely lost it,NOT
you arent talking to actual feminists about the attempts to close the wage gap clearly high level efforts to closing the gap arent simply demanding women get paid more they are more frequently trying to solve the issues that cause the gap to occur those differences that you think need to be accounted for are the very things feminists are trying to address dont control for the issues that cause the gap fix those issues there is also an opportunity gap for many jobs not simply differences based on as you put it choices that its dishonest to ignore,NOT
and make it so men are able to and feel more obligation to share the home and parenting workload with their partners,NOT
since you eat alot of cooked food previously and alot of animals products i would recommend you eat more cooked vegan food to start off than fruit have fruit as like a side dish or snack but dont eat it only as a meal you will feel better in my opinion eating more grains rice beans lentils corn oatmeal etc,NOT
the argument that educated activists are making about the inequality in overall pay is that women gravitating towards lower paying majors is the issue systematic sexism is the problem i personally have never claimed that individual businesses are paying women less though that may be true for some it is the expectations of women in society that are the real problem we need to advocate for encouraging young women and showing them that they are capable of pursuing careers in male dominated fields the expectation that women must be the primary carers for children which in itself is no issue but the expectation is is another problem that forces women from getting demanding jobs this videos points did not address this problem at all and instead made the points supporting the inequality argument much clearer systematic sexism is the problem not an abundance of individual sexism in each employer focus on the real issues please not responding to a tangential point,NOT
lot of angry feminists here,NOT
did john rose die ,NOT
ok i think every girl has experienced penis envy,NOT
if the wage gap was true why are so many men wanting to be transgender women maam,NOT
vote democrat to ensure this keeps going,NOT
love your response  i am not trans but dated a ftm for a long time and during the transition and this is a mockery of what we fought for  years ago,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist,NOT
trish if that makes sense    me no no it doesnt trisha ,NOT
what people miss is theres the fact that it doesnt exist,NOT
they get paid the same but they show up less  wage gap,NOT
i thought this was paralympics,NOT
get a better job thats why,NOT
good that you highlighted that masculinityfemininity has nothing to do with gender it hasnt got anything to do with sexual preference either i consider myself quite feminine but also quite heterosexual and quite cismale,NOT
i am something,NOT
of course just keep trying to focus on other factors and avoid the fact that men know how to do better in buisness so they earn more,ABU
im pretty sure your diet is going just as good as your relationship with sean,NOT
how can you identify  as both trans and as the sex you were born as  shes talking garbage,NOT
lol im the type of vegan that eats a lot of vegan ice cream and the vegan margarine yes i knowi should stop,NOT
there trying to push gmo plant base food thats modified to cut certain dna  basically changing you into something else do ya research,NOT
is gender studies not one of the worst paying majors,NOT
but we all know this is old shes not vegan anymorethis is fake,NOT
this also does not discuss the fact that men with mba degrees work  more hours than women it also does not take into consideration the male ego vs the female ego in business the is one of the factors that contributes the need for continued exponential success in males slightly more than it does in females psychologically and physiologically men and women are different that difference is sometimes a good thing mean that females are better at certain things than males and vise versa this difference in skill can then used to run a successful business,NOT
shes totally trolling but my favorite part of the video this is vodka,NOT
you know when i was a high school senior varsity basketball player at  i identified as a grade schooler and wanted to compete on those teams but i was discriminated against and not allowed to,NOT
transgender girls meaning boys pretending to be girls  the people that endorse and encourage this are just as mentally defunctthese people need psychological help not pills and treatments that help further their delusionsyou cannot ever change your genderplease stop this madness,ABU
thank you most big channels wouldnt do this because of the hate it is good for there to be people doing something to set the record straight instead of to look good,NOT
your such a disrespectful little bitch,NOT
its statistically more common for men to work longer hours so thats why they get paid higher,NOT
i want to enter the kids wrestling division im  but identify as  this way i have a chance to winlol jk but this is hella unfair,NOT
she either is  just doing it for attention  literally delusion as hell and needs help i think she has sexuality and gender mixed up she has shown zero signs of being trans her reasonings to being trans are a joke i am not one to say who u can and cannot be but come on shes making trans people look like a joke trisha has been needing serious psychological help  the back lash she willhas received from that video is going to change her life forever personally i think she is ignorant on the subject and has sexuality mixed up with gender adding on she has a lot of mental issues that she doesnt know how to control so pushing it on the im transgender is the easiest way for her adding on the whole attracted to gay men they are still men shit i like girls and i can see a girl who is lesbian and think shes attractive but that doesnt mean im lesbian it still would be heterosexual of me she needs help lastly masculinity doesnt make you male it is a spectrum,ABU
youtube ads now redpilling people is this timeline a hologram,NOT
i was told i would gain weight from being a vegetarian but ive lost  pounds without even realizing it its what you eat if being vegetarian means only eating macaroni and cheese nachos cheese pizza etc you will probably gain weight if you eat beans and rice and corn and potatoes  youll get the protein and carbs you need without gaining weight being vegan is great and id love to be vegan someday good job for trying it out,NOT
she admits that there is a wage gap that contradicts the title of the video,NOT
common cents and sense some value the other more which one are you,NOT
why does she look like hillary clinton,NOT

yeahh girl  good luck going vegan changed my life in so many ways if you remember me like  years ago i was a mess although i photoshopped my pictures lol in person i looked like i was falling apart i didnt realize i had a toxic effect from meat i just knew it always made me feel lethargic after eating it now i know i have a gene that gives me dna damage from smoked and cooked meat when certain chemicals are released i am also lactose intolerant but was drinking milk anyway and have bad reactions to simple carbs processed sugar and preservatives i was  lbs heavier i had sleep disorders paralasis and nocturnal panic attacks add mood swings cysts and a bunch of other issues i had no idea how sensitive i was till i started eating clean i lost  lbs and i felt better than i have ever felt in my life no brain fog so much focus energy and people were telling me at  that i looked younger and better than i did at  it literally changed my lifebeyond the little good karma vibes from knowing im doing a good thing for the environmentanimals  ,NOT
it used to be a joke years ago when they had pro basketball player larry johnson dress like a old woman and called himself grandmama but its only a matter of time before the farce will becomes reality when more gay transgender and other weirdo male basketball players start declaring themselves women to join the womens basketball league or get a scholarship to play college ball only it wont be funny to a real young woman that loses her opportunity to be on a womens pro team or a chance to play college ball because of this liberal progressive nonsense,ABU

also people in the comments blaming the women for choosing to have children are missing the point it takes two to make a baby yet our society deems it to be the womens responsibility to raise the baby causing them to be seen as less reliable workers it is discrimination and sexism exploring the roots and causes of sexism does not disprove that sexism exists expanding your world view will help you realize that people face discrimination that you cant understand and you should try to empathize in order to fight it,NOT
tofu or soy meat is a great source of protein beans are also really good make sure you have a good amount of vegetables,NOT

there needs to be a transgender category the reason why this world is so messed up is because humans care more about their feelings and will easily overlook or play down facts and bend rules so they can cater to their wantsdesiresfeelings men and women are men and women transgender is transgender if im white and identify as black im still white the fact theres even an argument is evidence enough that humans feelings reign over solid reason and political agenda reigns supreme,NOT
ommgmmmm finally omg,NOT

so simpsons paradox,NOT
make sure you eat enough and move d freelee has her body from both the diet but also from her exercise im not saying bike up hills etc hahah but go on long walks and keep drinking lots of water,NOT
the gender pay gap is a strategy to pit working women against working men  divide and conquer and the top  laughs all the way to the bank,NOT
trisha needs help,NOT
the main focus should be around peoples health everyone wants to be healthy on the other hand the majority of people dont care about the environment when they eat bottom line most people are selfish and dont give a  about anyone or anything that is not related to them process vegan food is not health promoting and being vegan is not the answer to optimal health whole foods free of chemicals and minimally process are the key most restaurants and chefs are all about how to deliver chemicals throughout food if you want to eat rice boiled it in water and eat it stop falling into the artificial stimulation produced by the saturation and processing of food throughout added chemicals we are not carnivores neither omnivores otherwise meat would be perfect and wouldnt cause any problem whatsoever the main objection of people to make a change in diet is the fear of missing the food they think they love but the reality is than they cant taste good food because they are saturated and their senses arent sensible enough after a terrible diet our taste improves dramatically over time after adopting a health promoting diet free of salty animal products sugar and oil find a way to demonstrate to people that they will not only be healthier but they will enjoy food like never before and realize that is nothing like sitting on the couch watching tv with the mind empty healthy people are more energetic and enthusiastic about food and that shows that is not the end of your happiness its the beginning,NOT
i like girls but i am a gay man me sigh oh boy this gonna be this kind of video i dont like attention mmk sweetie i am more attracted to gay men honey arent we all lmaooo like no hate on trisha but come on man please please if your going to do this do your research cuz not a lot of what your saying is adding up i really hope this shit aint for views,NOT
even if those girls werent transgender they would still dust that ladies daughter  people just gotta take the big l and tell they kids to grind harder ,NOT
whelp  say cya your your flapper sacks,NOT
trisha youre seriously mixing up being trans and being uncomfortable about the societal standards of women you seriously need to see a therapist or a professional in this area because youre clearly very confused about your gender expression defining your gender youre not trans get some help,NOT
i think we all know trisha is mentally ill and if a therapist truly told her this they need to lose their license,ABU
 bucks on that every answer down similar to doesnt exist are issued by men anyone want in in this poll,NOT
did anyone ever research where the money these men make goes,NOT
im so glad to see so many people against them competing with women and im nit even really upset with them im more upset with who is allowing them to compete with women u can dress however u want makes no difference but they are not the same as women period i say u either race with the men or other transgenders of the same identity,ABU
wagesearnings talking about a wage gap is incorrect if there truly were a wage gap then companies would hire more women to save the money from the wage gap what we have is an earnings gap yes men make more money but not because we get paid more for the same job and the same amount of work more men choose work over family time more women choose family time over work here in lies the difference there is nothing to fight for as there is nothing to fight against it is illegal for companies to discriminate based on gender,NOT
here is another variable over  of teachers are womenso when they calculate the wagesdo they factor in that full time teaching is actually only a part time job i doubt it,NOT
so do i think im transgender   yes  do i identify with my natural born gender  do i know what transgender is     do dogs have brains,NOT
blaire mf white where r u at,NOT
call a free lgbtq partyline number  at     or     or    ,NOT
this bothers me so much i dont live in a place where i am able to be my true self and transition and then there are people saying that im not girly so im a gay man it pisses me off this video gets attention but there are so many other people out there doing this bull shit i dont have an option to transition my mother is not supporting at all and my dad left i am losing everything and then this happens come on guys,NOT
doesnt exist in the uk we have minimum or living wage everyone is paid due to abilities and hours they work meaning more skill more pay per hour so if you want to fix the wage gap then work more men take jobs that are heavy hard working women take softer jobs like table services and retail,NOT
anything from gardein,NOT
 so wait youre trying to say theres a wage gap but its okay since women just naturally choose to not work hard enough and there are no women that work overtime or try to get higher paying jobs either if that is the case then why,NOT
i fully agree and i dont like my community being used as a stepping stone in someones career fuck these people,NOT
i wonder how this plays in the professional world like can a transgender girl to boy play in the nba,NOT
we all have feminine and masculine energy its normal,NOT
mrs sommers is a legend,NOT
there are so many negative comments saying things like lmao she was just eating bacon on snapchat or shell never be able to do it when neither of those are beneficial to her or anybody else for that matter i for one as a long time follower of trisha am so proud of her i only wish that now that the two weeks are over because as we all know she prefilms her videos she had vlogged her two weeks maybe she did and just havent posted them yet i would be very fascinated to see how she did what her temptations were how she felt and what her modified diet consisted of anyway love you trish maybe consider elongating the two weeks i guarantee substantial weight loss results and an overall feeling of wellness good luck trisha,NOT
god whatever happened to just being a tomboy you relate to boys dont wear makeup etc you have penis envy great so does every girl ever because having a penis and being a man is just so much easier biologically and in the society that we live in its unfortunate but that doesnt mean that you are trans this is just frustrating to watch because so many of the things she is saying are things that everyone experiences and its really disrespectful and discrediting to actual transgender people,NOT
this is all correct but take in factors such as social pressures it is more expected for a women to give up work temporarily or permanently in order to take care of their children which is unfair on both women and men also a company is more likely to promote a man over a women especially if she is of the age where most women have children because maternity leave is expensive for companies to deal with again i believe that this is unfair i think that a way to reduce the gender pay gap is to increase the length of paternity leave to the length of maternity leave not only to eradicate the inequality but also so that a man can have the necessary time with his child,NOT
im typical male that works out twice a week and has a decent muscle mass in most sports and pretty much any physical comparison i would destroy a good majority of female competitors in speed strength and endurance its a really simple fact males and females are physiologically different regardless what your feelers tell you about yourself its unfair for the actual girls to go up against males that think they are girls,ABU
this is fucked up no matter if shes trolling or not if she is trolling she just ended her career and made transpeople look like a joke on purpose if shes not trolling she will actually feel dysphoria if shes going to transition,ABU
you go girl follow stephanie lange on snapchat she posts loads of vegan food recipes xx,NOT
who else is looking for butthurt feminists in the comments,NOT
screw it im going to put on a weave and try out for wnba im going to dunk all over them women and if anybody says a thing about it i will scream discrimination against gaysyou see the wackiness of all this,ABU
this video is a joke on her snapchat story yesterday she was eating bacon  eggs and sour cream  onion chips that are not vegan sooo i would say this is completely fake and what she said about being vegetarian is false too since she was eating bacon lol,NOT
omg trish good luck,NOT
so much bullshit in this video who falls for this crap hey vox why not use facts and be truthful for once oh yeah doesnt fit the agenda,NOT
women also dont negotiate salary like men do upon starting a position and when they do they usually request more benefits and perks than demanding higher dollar compensation this probably explains the narrow gap that still remains as cited in the video,NOT
everyone bitching about her doing it wrong please kindly stfu just be happy shes trying this is amazing,NOT
if this is true just be gender fluid and pan,NOT
trisha may be an attention whore but if she is trolling with all this and people take her seriously ill have to take my hat offlol,ABU
im so proud of you your awesome please keep the great work up try finding vegan cheese and chocolate it makes it easier to be vegan ,NOT
i love how i saw your video and was like oh god blaire  also i dont think trisha is transi was honestly really confused throughout her whole video,NOT
what function do the gallbladder and bile production have for a vegan is it just sitting there doing nothing also the locally produced organic grass fed beef that i consume is soothing for the planet a vegan diet where i live destroys the ecosystem,NOT
ive been vegan since last may it took awhile to convince my mom but packaged food is ok but dont be afraid to explore carbs and vegetables too i also prefer to have protein shakes with almond milk in the morning if youre afraid youll be lacking some vitamins its a good place to start im also lactose intolerant so i will say that i havent gained any significant weight since i was  when i stopped having dairy and i also stopped breaking out in acne in the past  years i have gained lbs but i will also say that im much more muscle dense than i used to be also take multi vitamins and possibly fish oil if youll allow yourself,NOT
omg freelee im in love ,NOT
this is so awesome but i just have a feeling it will only be the twoish weeks she has tons of fur leather and animal tested products and in no way do i see that no longer being in her future being that she loves designer and such but i do love the idea and hope that she continues to further her vegan lifestyle to prove me wrong ,NOT
vox video animation is great always enjoy this kind of video very educational simple yet infomative,NOT
so what should be done is try to shrink the gender gap here  the society expects for the mothers to do more and mothere actually do more,NOT
yayyyyy you can do it  get protein from beans legumes carbs peanut butter ect also use chronometer to track your nutrients you can also google any other nutrient you need ,NOT
 thats genderfluid bro,NOT
the most common sense explanation i have come across we have the same problem in the uk media and politicians perpetuating the myth that women are paid less than men for doing the same job i dont get why they want to portray women as victims,NOT
 male in math and computer science thats bull shitt there are no females in any of my classes ,NOT
any commentary on tess holliday coming out as queer shes the fat lady that wants recognition for the fat acceptance movement and attention from the fashion industry i believe shes using the lgbtq community because we literally accept anyone unfortunately,NOT

pearce morgan is such a jerk,NOT
nowhere in the constitution does it say that we have to play along with the make believe games of others you can play those games all you want but none of us have to accept them,ABU
money shouldnt exist full stop full communism is the future,NOT
i honestly believe that a job that requires extreme physical labor should amount to the same pay as a job that requires extreme mental labor both forms of jobs are used to service the world and if one were to not exist we wouldnt have a sustainable world i believe that gaps exist in both experience and that experience compared to mental vs physical i really dont think that a construction worker gets as much as a surgeon however both jobs are important one can save a life or give new life and the other can build homes for that life to live in,NOT
plant based but im still glad youre taking a big step in the good direction ,NOT
wouldnt companies only just hire women if they could pay them less than men,NOT
its rediculouse this is how they become famous and rich how does anyone think they dont have an advantageits a joke they should compete with eachotherthere a whole other race of peoplethey are baphomets,ABU
i was actually going to go low carb lol for the new year but this plant base is speaking to me in a way i cant ignore im going to go in the plant base direction now and see how it feels and works maybe even in the hateful climate were in today this could be the beginning of the era of enlightenment thats more prophetic than we realize,NOT
slay girl im rooting for u but no one gonna take my chicken nuggets from me,NOT

check out  on instagram shes vegan and her meals are totally minimalist its fckin easy to make them and her shape is awesome ,NOT
trisha this title is not a good idea ,NOT
every woman thinks it would be easier to have a penis nobody wants to bleed from their vagina,NOT
now all of a sudden all these females dont wanna be talking about how men and females are equal now its all guys can compete against woman cause its unfair fucking hypocrites,NOT
shes not trans shes a troll,NOT
a cow puts far more back into the land than it takes out which is something you vegans cannot do the fashion industry and the vegan industy are the real danger to the planet do you know how much water it takes it takes to make one cotton tshirt what about all these disgusting cooking oils and margorines do you know how much water it takes to grow those seeds and how much power to run the machinery and chemicals etc not to mention the plasic containers they are sold in well done vegans you people are destroying the land to make all this crap the land is turning to dust theres nothing being returned because nothing is there youre tilling the soil to a depth of four inches and killing the life in it it will end up in the ocean,NOT
equal work um no in most jobs men perform better thats the reason for the wage gap,NOT
i think trisha needs a break from social media and yt to find herself and establish genuine love for herself if she puts absolutely no effort into transitioning shes not trans as many transfemme or transmasculine do they just get to dress up and play the part without actually putting in the effort sono gigi you dont have to believe her until she starts showing signs of transition which she probably wont if she just said shes okay with her biological birth you can be a more masculine woman that makes you a tomboy not a man you can be a feminine guy youre probably gaybut youre not a woman,NOT
why dont business only hire women yes thats exactly what feminism want hire only woman because that person is a woman,NOT
i call bs this is an old video,NOT
holy sht  i just came to see the cute brunette what the hell we roll up on i think i made a wrong turn in albuquerque,NOT
i really wanna go vegan but ive recovered from an eating disorder im finally feeling comfortable with my current weight and ive heard alot of people say that you gain weight to start and even the idea of that gives me so much anxiety  i know its silly considering the end result and the ethics or maybe you dont gain weight i dont know  any advicetips expereinces for me friends,NOT
i think this issue is a lot more prevalent in higher paying jobs primarily due to this old boys league mentality have any of you ever seen the film goat its quite an interesting look into the world of fraternities and how they shape these old boys leagues that exist to this day in high power positions,NOT
i feel bad for gigi shes so blindly ignorant to the way shes being manipulated right now,NOT
bonus stupidity points for believing the male advantage is  due to testosterone,NOT
soo not completing the same amount of hours is not the same as not getting the same paymentits a few flaws in this agreement especially towards the end when they discuss how women dont work hours because of personal factors ,NOT
also if the wage gap is still in mens favor take into account that maternity leave is paid and that women live longer so they get more out of social security,NOT
my sister is a fullon stereotypical millennial feminist and i absolutely destroyed her with these facts thank you,NOT
my crush im gay me i identify as a gay man,NOT
try the dairy free ben  kerrys if youre craving icecream and i reccomend mommy tang  kalel ,NOT
wtf this video doesent agree with me the wage gap is clearly a myth and a huge lie made by idiot feminists  is clearly caused by the sexist men and patriarchy im triggered disliked and unsubbed,NOT
there is no wage gap women statistically work less than men to care for children or take more vacations because woman also will take more time off than a man will,NOT
the job should have a salary  and that should be paid to the person that taking the job it should not have any thing to do with the sex of the person taking the job  it must have been an idiot that came up with one salary for a women and another for a man companies using this idea must have lost millions over the years lol make any wonder a lot of companies go bust if they let the sex of a candidate for the job decide the salary what a screwed up world,NOT
baby i support your gender identity but this does not sound to me like being a trans man however this does very much sound like genderfluid identifying female sometimes male sometimes sometimes neither sometimes both,NOT

this was amazing thanks for all that you do,NOT
you maam have got my subscription first woman to realize the feminist lies,ABU
perfectly presented madame kudos ms summers,NOT
theythem is not identifying as multiple personalities what i,NOT
i cant believe trishas logic she thinks that shes trans and cis at the same time while thinking that shes black while shes pale as fuck,ABU
someone give her the nobel peace prize,NOT
ugh yes we know this already its the reason why this happens we are trying to solve i think that it has to do with the facts that what is considered normaltypical jobs for men and women and what is considered normal comes from the old gender strereotypes that lead us its easier to be normal ill give an example im a woman whos always been interested on woodworks in elementary school i had to decide if i go to sewing classes or woodworking i wanted to go to woodworking but since i was really shy and all my friends went to sewing classes i followed them things like these leads to less experience and makes chances to get to your chosen schooljobs etc worse well thankfully things arent that bad in my country and i did get into a carpenter school now getting a job is a different story d,NOT
i wont be a bullshit vegan guy right now not all things vegan are good but the best vegan meat brand is gardein there meat if the best excluding the meatballs also the best meat ive ever had is morning star riblets you have to try them best sour cream is tofutti brand finally the best cheeses have to be from follow your heart the best spreadable cheese to go with a cracked plate is nuttin ordinary plain cashew spread  it has a sharper taste like stronger dairy cheese does so delicious cashew salted caramel ice cream with chocolate chips was one of the best ice creams ive ever had but you have to really like caramel to like it here are some tips to save money buy frozen fruit more often then fresh because they are much better in smoothies and they are cheeper another tip is to look at the ingredients in store brand breads because more often then not they are vegan because its cheeper to make that way writing the rest plus some recipes down below,NOT
i miss the rick moranis sign off lol,NOT
if i pay to keep your videos free theyre not free to me,NOT
trisha lmao we know you are a troll but people get offended by this shit bad call,NOT
oh shit im early,NOT
which came first the chicken or the egg is it possible that the types of work that women are drawn to social work counseling etc are undervalued to begin with,NOT
so being transgender has less to do with sexual orientation and more with the feeling that you were born in the wrong body all the terms that are currently being used describe sexual preference sexual identity etc have me extremely confused i often feel like i require a handbook to help me grasp the most recent celebrity coming out,NOT
carbs you honestly might gain more weight in the beginning because of your destroyed metabolism but the weight will shed off especially if you exercise there is vegan pizza burritos tacos and so many more options trish you live in la there are so many great options there,NOT
notice the difference between the ratings of the video exposing wagegap patriarchy as bs and the buzzfeed video saying that the patriarchy oppresses womens wages oh wait buzzfeed disabled their ratings because they cant handle the truth,NOT
hi im wanting to research if the really is a wage gap between men and women i found this video and you state your sources oral but for the essay that is not going to be enough and also becuse its such a conteversal topic and the teacher migh get trigger ,NOT
trisha im so happy,NOT
some tips watch out for carbfat overload vegan meats and cheeses and sugary treats and pasta are sooooo high in calories i went vegan months ago and gained lbs ive now figured out what works better for me i stay away from processed vegan foods and try to eat whole foods and raw when possible make sure you take b if youre going vegan for weight loss it will help your metabolism drink loads of water and enjoy the awesome feeling of saving the planet ,NOT
you still have to watch your calories but you will be able to eat a lot more food on a vegan diet because plant foods are naturally less calorie dense,NOT
prager university had a woman narrate this and probably quite a few writeproduce it as well and theres still  thousand uninformed sjws that downvoted this video because of the title,NOT
just because you feel like you are more  manly  in ways does not mean you are trans please educate yourself these are preferences,NOT
damn your sitting on the kitchen floor set up is still classier than most youtubers best set up,NOT
now i know yall a bunch of bs rightwinger bullshitters shame on calling yaself a university,NOT
so you can be mentally ill and play make believe in all other facets of life but once it comes to sports you draw the line sounds about right for the libtards,ABU
i think shes got something called i make shizz up for attention,NOT
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha good one,NOT
so what youre saying is there is a wage gap the argument is just over the size of that wage gap,NOT
can we also please clarify the correct definition of p envy a person with a v cannot have p envy p envy is when a person with a p envies the size of another persons p im not sure if im allowed to type the actual words out,NOT
more like earnings gap if women want to do same amount of money they should work the same amount same goes for men ofc aka same job same time same year same efficiency and so on you cant compare a butcher to an rocket scientist and say this is an unfair wage gap,NOT
ive followed trish through everything her relationships her mental breakdowns her glow ups her going through her mental disorders all of it but this this is something else,NOT
this was the first actual wtfsilence moment ive experienced watching youtube videosits actually unfathomable,NOT
climate changes hoxe,NOT
i cant wait to be a stay at home dad let the women do the work for a change ,NOT
conclusion there is not a wage gap there is an earnings and field access gap based heavily on hours flexibility with perhaps some employer bias based on the type of worker theyre looking for solution there is no direct solution plenty of things to help broadly though most of which involve innovation and an improved situation for all workers,NOT
a lot of twisted information in this video disgraceful,NOT
i have been a vegan for the last  years of my  year existence better late than never i am non the less highly disappointed that you included greta thunberg in your video she is an exploited unstable individual who has no business leading any vegan causes on a world stage by your association with this indoctrinated child you damage your cause incredibly her public hysterics alienate  times the amount of people that would be swayed by her antics eg her compadres spent more fossil fuel flying a private jet to follow her stupid canoe trip across the atlantic than if they had all flown commercial insteadstupid pr people films like game changers are what will win over more peoplenot exploited mental nazi youth,NOT
this is a joke right,NOT
thats is random but i hate the new youtube comment section,NOT
that video already seems like another do dogs have brains video,NOT
if youre only eating fruit not only will you spike your blood sugar but youre also gain weight a lot weight,NOT
holy moly this woman needs to be president,NOT
what a load of bs i have worked for corporations in ny where i employed male and female candidates with same experienceskills for exactly the same roles and there was  pay inequality biased towards men there are many successful lawsuits happening all the time because of this issue btw i am male,NOT
so she blatantly ignores the fact that not all of those were choices maybe some of the woman in lower paying jobs wanted something that paid more but were rejected because they were female maybe sexism lies more in the people with the duty of hiring rather than the people who give out wages,NOT
im willing to bet that vox chose a study that focused on highincome earners because at lowincome brackets there is almost no wage gap,NOT
im going vegetarian as a step forward to going vegan when i get older,NOT
i will be the one to take loads of insults and thumbs downs on this but prager should not be using such an absolute title for this video their arguments are correct yes the popular  cents per dollar mantra is the result of statistical illiteracy but they are not addressing the fact that a wage gap indeed exists and can be shrunken by some means for example we could encourage women to pursue the hard sciences encourage better wage and salary negotiation and promote better work ethic saying that a small gap exists and is thus irrelevant is nonsense i expect better from prager,NOT
hang on i thought the feminists were saying for decades that men and women were the same these trans athletes are just outworking the other girls,NOT
the wage gap is that men dont cost as much to employ as women and there is no wage gap feminazis just hate men,NOT
trisha looks like shes gone through so much i hope shes okay ,NOT
in my job as an executive director of a nonprofit we pay men and women equally but women end up making less because they take more time off exceeding what we allow which means they arent paid for it a couple women scream equal pay for equal work but i remind them that also means equal work for equal pay if they arent there to work they wont get paid for it unfortunately for women women take time off not only when they are sick but also when family members are sick or when someone in the family has a school consultation or school play or drs or dentists appointment one woman in the office would leave every day at pm an hour before everyone else because the bus would drop her kids off at school at that time when she complained about me docking her pay for that i explained that why would it be fair for me to pay her that hour when the others in the office were actually working to be paid i had suggested that she not take a lunch or come in early but those didnt work for her either i felt like she was lucky i let her go home early every day she felt like i was robbing her,NOT
lol the wind doesnt glisten blaire,NOT
brah you need more food than that good luck in your vegan adventures saving animals one by one ,NOT
you need to watch mommy tang she is awesome,NOT
is she trying to say she has a crush on shane,NOT
its showing shes able to download the video i feel silly but how,NOT
and if these guys ran with their respective genders theyd be smoked,ABU
hummus is yummy i eat mine with celery or cucumber avacado in moderation for healthy fats i like morning star veggie burgers with vegan provoloneyummy for a treat the ben and jerrys vegan ice cream is sooo yummy cashew milk is bomb please be careful with the raw till  diet they promote an unlimited amount of carbs and that is not healthy you need fats for nero healthlike brain function and absorption of certain vitamins like k and d also you need to exercise tons to burn up all that sugar my doctor at the mayo clinic said that diet is not ideal for most busy working people it does work for some peoplebut one girl julia boer gained over  lbs in  months eat everything in moderation eat as many greens as you wantbut dont slam in the carbs like rt proclaims,NOT
yves and gardein meats are great for transition freelee would be proud,NOT
transgenders competing with women is it an unfair advantage  yes of course it bloody is they can identify as what the f they want but biologically they are male with male biological advantages lets debate this another way men vs women in tennis  women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in football  women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in rugby  women not able to compete physically with men men vs women in athletics  women not able to compete physically with men but in this liberal pc mentally ill world a man who has a chromosome abnormality resulting in nature causing her to be born a him can compete with women despite being biologically a man and having the physical advantages such as strengthendurance and stamina its like a athlete who uses performance enhancing drugs theres nothing fair about transgenders competing with women clown world,NOT
im saving this video so i can just link it to whoever thinks the wage gap is real a lot easier than having to repeat myself over and over again,NOT
im trying to go vegan too what advice do you have for someone making the transition i had a hard time finding vegan items in trader joes evenwhere do you shop,NOT
i think that we have finally gotten to a point where a person man or woman can become whatever theyd like to be,NOT
i thought that it was by average earnings by women and men and i argued about things such as choosing different paths and hours but because of this it seems that women make more considering how many women work full time,NOT
i honestly hate that i have her money by watching this video but i had to see this train wreck,NOT
this is a whole other topic yes fuck trish but how are you going to come and defend the lgbtq community especially the trans community while still supporting chickfila lol thats one of the restaurants that puts more money on antilgbtq campaigns lol they hypocrisy,NOT
if companies pay women less than men why dont said companies only hire women to save money,NOT
soooo glad im not having kids,NOT
dates dates taste just like chocolate theyre a lifesaver when switching to vegan also yes your skin will clear up and be soooo smooth after i cut out dairy my face cleared and started to glow in  weeks good luck girl we got your back ,NOT
i find it interesting that you guys dont give the percentage for the wage gap with in an industry it shrinks to  mmmm wonder why you lezve that bit out,NOT
thank you i m french viewer usa took the foul french theory at the frenchs in s fermented this during sixty years and vomit back this theory all around the world now feminist propaganda invads my country and this fake about wage gap is in every news merci pour votre debunkage,NOT
 this message is really long and i hope the creators of this video will take out some minutes from their time to read it i genuinely think these are valid arguments and i promise this is not hate thank you and sorryfor the long comment well i guess its time to trap you in your own statistics vox as you mentioned about the job of a pharmacist you should that women earned  of what men did where is the other  as you mentioned that now there are more flexible hours and she can work on hours suitable so the variable of a kid is gone whether a woman has a kid or not so in theory according to you the wage gap should not exist between pharmacists but it does so what could possibly be the reason of the missing  another thing in the statistics you showed about different types of jobs tech business and one other it is true that tech has a shrinked up wage gap but i most certainly saw some green dots on the middle range too if a woman is doing her job completing experiments and whatever else is done on labs then why are there some positions in the tech itself that have an existing wage gap now going on to the study of mba students the one between  and  now this time most variables are same the women have the exact same qualifications as the men and is most cases even the same age as men so now tell me even after that why are woman paid  less than men yes the wage gap is considerably less in this scenario and that is really great but why is there a difference at all this all is regardless whether a woman has a kid or not or even married after all you showed us the statistics of difference of wage gap between woman who have kids and woman who do not agreed that there was a considerable difference but then again the column of women who do not have kids was not zero why not this time there is clear indication that having kids is not the prime reason of women being paid less than men so my final question is if this is clearly not the prime reason then what is,NOT
whatever video you watched about the animal industry is not how anything actually works,NOT
i think i got what u got boo,NOT
these two are males and have a physical advantage over females i have nothing against trans persons but that advantage is unfair,ABU
yeah and trish just posted a video yesterday of her eating you guessed it meat,NOT
i couldnt even imagine that vox would make a video like this its a good thing,NOT
this is vodka btwhow i felt through out the whole video,NOT
if men have mens league and womens have womens leagues then if trans people truly want to belong then have a trans league,ABU
they have an unfair advantagethat is a fact so they do not deserve to compete in womens sportswe just stand amost no chance,ABU
the fact that this still has to be explained is just pathetic they never have answers for why companies dont hire more women if women get paid less than men they always talk about wanting to see more women in certain jobs but theyre always these high paying low risk jobs its never coal mining or working on off shore oil rigs or anything like that they go on and on about wanting to see more women in stem fields like theres some agenda by the patriarchy which doesnt exist to keep women out of those jobs it couldnt possibly be that women just dont want to go into those fields right they want to see women represented everywhere except the loudest hottest and most dangerous jobs because equality,NOT
thats great that youre gonna eat vegan even if its just for a couple of weeks finally youll be able to take the meat goggles off and really look at the meat and dairy industry from the outsidein regardless of your reasons to do it youll still be doing it at the end of the day and im sure if you do it the right way with the help of the community including freelee youll be on the right track and youll see the way you feel during and even after hopefully you stay vegan for your own sake and the animals overall good for you for taking this huge step towards bettering yourself ,NOT
if she was trans wouldnt she have dysphoria she literally sells her nudes online and posts them everywhere wouldnt a trans person who is there in there natural born body super uncomfortable and how the hell do you identify as a gay male drag queen like gtfo trish being trans isnt a fucking trend,NOT
also try quinoa for your protein it has all essential amino acids and is a great source of fiber you can have it with a bunch of cooked veggies like broccoli and carrots for ice cream freeze some chopped bananas and blend them up with almond milk and a touch of cocoa so proud of you and excited to see the progress ,NOT

what is this shit,ABU
excluded youre excluding an entire gender you shithead parents youre not excluded compete against men or other transgenders but get a fkn grip,ABU
gardean has some amazing fake meat products and fake fish products and theyre avaliable at target,NOT
as a female i do notice a wage gap but for all i know its a result of the male wanting to negotiate more on salary and the companys health could also have played a role because he was hired later after about a year or two of working for the company another female was hired who made a little less than me and hadnt even finished her degree,NOT
yaaay im so happy for you girl good luck on your journey ,NOT
feminist gather and spam dislike triggered killallmen endhumanity,NOT
so theyre payed the same but more men work than women because they have babies and stuff well thats good for me,NOT
freelees bitch attitude and annoying ass personality makes me want to go get a job at perduethats how much i cant fucking stand her,ABU

you cant lower something that does not exist,NOT
men make up  of workplace deaths and suicides but we arent arguing to close that gargantuan gap are we in addition the wage gap is irrelevant as despite earning less women control more money than men men earn  of all income but only account for  of domestic spending men only spend  of what they earn after tax in contrast women make up  of all income but control  of domestic spending meaning women on average spend  more money than they earn rd wave feminism is a joke,NOT
tbh this shit is what makes people be against trans people let those wanna be girls get in line for the boys bathroom or make a rd bathroom for weird people,ABU
they are taking drugs to alter their natural muscle structure you are breaking the rules you cannot be on the team,ABU
blame it on the rain,NOT
women  months off paid if they have a baby  this is why companys dont hire them,NOT
thank you mrs sommers ,NOT
earnings gap not a wage gap if you could pay a woman less to do the same job then every company would hire women,NOT
really if a man is at beck and call he is considered a provider if women do it they are bad mothers but i am sure that double standard and other societal implications were looked to in detail in part two of this video,NOT
you legit debunked your own video woman pay more attention to kids and males are more likely to do overtime because they are seen as the provider,NOT
well done plant based news ,NOT
i had no idea this was coming so soon im so excited,NOT
this is bullshit they should not be able to run start a trans only sport,ABU
males usually work longer then women so that explains the wage gap,NOT
i love you blaire you are so well spoken beautiful intelligent and fearless you are truly an inspiration,NOT
omfg this is so old,NOT
i think all men use hormon bloques and compete against womendone sarcasm ,NOT
sorry i found this trisha so annoying i could not watch,NOT
the wage gap is caused by women women dont go for higher jobs so they dont get as much money so a women complaining about a wage gap is hypocritical,NOT
whatever happened to the terms tomboy and tomgirl ,NOT
you know what people can say freelee just bullies and doesnt work and doesnt help the vegan movement but look at trish literally the last person we ever thought now giving it a go you go girl,NOT
why do youtubers always film sitting on the floor,NOT
if freelee replies ill go vegan,NOT

at that time she was still with seanmaking certain decisions when she felt really good and happy about everything things changed she is currently going through a heartbreak and i dont think that she would stick with this diet i think people should be careful and not say everything on social media,NOT
what aload of crap  and im being polite,NOT
freelee must be so proud,NOT
identifying as both male and female is called being genderqueer or genderfluid hun youre confused please learn your terminology before posting a  minute video on something you clearly dont have a vast understanding of,NOT
i am one month in and i can say i sleep so much better at night as well as have more energy to get through the day also as a cosplayer my face usually breaks out horribly but since i have switched my face has been clearing up quite a bit,NOT

why is this generation so freaking complicated,NOT
im really hoping i can become vegetarian or vegan some time its been something i want to do so i hope your vids can help since ive never seen your vids  i think and i cant watch the slaughter house vid because it hurts so much when i see innocent animals being hurt the few seconds you showed of the vid killed me its so upsetting and disgusting that the people can do that to innocent animals  it always makes me hates humans and hate myself since i havent helped in any way but im still living at home with my parents im  and they eat meat so its kinda hard i hope theres some easy things i can do to ease into the diet,NOT
its all so confusing to us straights cis folks she may just be confused as everyone else,NOT
i need a hair up no makeup female merch love your content by the way,NOT
i had a discussion with my world geography teacher and pleased to see that he was enjoying the convo and had points that stood out as well im all for equality and would love to speak about more politics then anything,NOT
im surprised its very hard to make a  minute long video on something that doesnt exist,NOT
trisha this is amazing  get more bananas and fruit get potatoes rice beans pasta tofu and veggies there are so many vegan recipe videos here on youtube this is amazing eventually you should start using cruelty free cosmetics  please keep updating us on how this new lifestyle is going welcome to the vegan community ,NOT
being a bully is not the way to successfully advocate veganism for all the people who think all vegans are delusional and judgmental assholes please visit unnaturalvegans channel very aggressive people like freelee are great at bringing attention to veganism but a lot of that attention is very negative while many people believe that any attention is good and is spreading the word i do disagree we need to be educational not hateful bullies ive mentioned that i was a vegan and have been told to kill myself when i wasnt being rude or telling anyone to change at all people hate me because of vegan extremists they think all vegans are extremists im aware that if i get any replies to this comment they will probably be incredibly negative from both vegans and omnivores im usually the unpopular opinion in both groups i get bullied by non vegans because im a crazy vegan and i get bullied by the vegans because i dont support the angry vegan movement too much hate,NOT
trish i think u might be gender fluid,NOT
i think she ate chicken,NOT
just watch cowspiracy and youre gonna stay vegan for the rest of your life,NOT
well trisha there is a difference between eating vegan and being vegan veganism is a philosophy and lifestyle that avoids animals products whenever practical and possible when you live vegan you stay vegan because you know that eating animal products is unnessary and morally wrong im glad you are making great strides trish keep it up and hopefully you can fully connect with the ethics from after hearing from other vegans ,NOT
those news are so exciting but it seems still so far away in a country like mine colombia i hope someday people understand and join this unstoppable movement,NOT

no way she could be vegan because of cinnabon delights,NOT
w h a t t h e f u c k,ABU
lemme answer that question it doesnt exist,NOT
honestly my advice is to take it slow and take it one day at a time dont rush in to it just slowly start to cut animal products out of your diet and then it will start to become a natural thing ,NOT
why is this sensitive these two need to compete against the boys if they carry the y chromosome,ABU
a transgender male is not a female it is wrong to allow them to compete with females if they have male bodies its not fair to the actual females they are being cheated,ABU
wasnt this the night of shanes movie premier like a month ago i remember this look bc i loved it lol,NOT
yes she did come out come out official as an idiot and not girly thats the closest she has come out of any closet,NOT
i support trish too i love more vegans,NOT

fullyrawkristina has really good smoothie and raw desert recipes for vegans go check her out,NOT
you can still eat pasta and rice and bread but not too much so you could have stir fries with are amazing ,NOT
why do her lips always look inflamed,NOT
so the wage gap isnt about discrimination its just a natural consequence of the way human nature operates in a given level of technological advancement and abundance,NOT

i almost congratulated vox for making a good video then they moved past why the pay differences in men and women is what it is such as seniority and hours worked,NOT
you do overlook one fact though the reason women keep taking on the majority of child raising is because the state gives the woman all the power and money and women have better protection for flexible working than men,NOT
mfs are still men at the end of the day so hell yeah they have the advantage thats just common sense,ABU
marinated tofu on qeonua and brown rice with broccoli and cauliflower mm yum,NOT
goddamnit men already explained thing about wage gap bogus since s people still talking bout this crap,NOT
hey just wanted to say how awesome you are and how much i learn about the trans community through you i had a question about something you said in this video about feeling feminine or masculine is not about gender i  percent agree with that statement so my question is as a trans woman what was it that made you realize that you were a female born in a mans body if it wasnt the fact that you felt more feminine than a man im sorry if this question is insensitive i definitely am ignorant to so many things that you and other trans women and men go through,NOT
take no vaccines and eat meat,NOT
for once you actually make sense,NOT
more like a plant based diet and im not hating on her but i dont think she will last that long people enjoy eating meat mostly because other people do and it makes them feel more comfortable and normal for doing it so some one like her who enjoys processed foods will more than likely crack when she goes to a restaurant with her meat eating friends,NOT
of course its unfair theyre fuckin men ,ABU
is this for america or the world,NOT
see this is buzzfeed but better because here theyre actually unbiased and dont have  channels to keep track of,NOT
watch mommytang plsss she has amazing vegan recipes,NOT
you should check out the channel raw allignment  on that youtube channel she gives vegan recipes and a lot more,NOT
the problem here is they dont give a shit that theres mountains of justification to why theyre paid less they want equality regardless of if they deserve it or not hence why they want to tax the rich out the ass to give to poor people who havent earned it logic doesnt matter to these people,ABU
well trisha you should watch thisgirlaudra i left a comment about this before but honestly she gives some great advice you arent getting anywhere with fad diets like it has such a negative impact though before you work on physical health work on mental health please,NOT
yess trishhhh and also dont think that you have to be extremely healthy to be vegan as long as your vegan thats all that matters eat dem fried brussel sprouts if u wannah girl ,NOT
are you fucking kididng ne,NOT
majority of male models dont get paid as much as female models,NOT
so how does greta get to all these places all over the world without flying,NOT

what do women do in their s and s ,NOT
butch lesbians are the proof that you can be masculine and still be a woman trisha needs serious mental help,NOT
at this point i cant tell if shes desperately seeking attention or theres just genuinely something wrong with her mentally,NOT
no hillary clinton looks more trans and obviously has bigger and uglier balls,ABU
trisha listen i know you are on a diet but if all you eat is fruit you will fail as a vegan especially as you are just starting out you need to kind of ease your way into it girl and there are sooooo many yummy foods out there that are vegan for instance i know you like ice cream so immediately go out and buy the so delicious cashew milk salted caramel cluster dairy free nice cream treat you will just die its that good i like to eat it in a cake cup ice cream coneyum also i make bagel sandwiches on the daily with the kite hill vegan cream cheeseso freaking good and you would never know its vegan you got this girl,NOT
frelee isnt skinny just because shes vegan she also works out a lot,NOT
i think you should perhaps rethink what her message was i dont think comparing it to being transgender or your transgender experience is entirely accurate just because i dont think she knows exactly what the term is but regardless she is struggling has hinted towards it for years and it does a lot more harm than good by invalidating someone elses difficulties just because it doesnt seem to make sense she used the wrong terms and comparisons yes no doubt thats more than likely due to ignorance but beyond that she clearly is really hurting and if shes felt this inside since being littlewell its no ones place to take that from her,NOT
its cause theyre black thats racist hahahaha,NOT
i want to see the statistics all brand new surgeon doctors of salary their first year male and female compare that and let see different we need to see form the same job same time experience in that job field and time with that company,NOT
tldr its just as most of us have been saying for years women dont work as many hours in general mythbusters,ABU
wage gap is fake,NOT
that vocal fry tho,NOT
what age gap,NOT
the cis white lady privilege and ignorance jumped out,NOT
we should thank the alok vaidmenons of the world for this demented logic,NOT
girl really got tired of sexism and decided to transition to male lmao,NOT
i think we need to examine the craig gap because it sounds like everyone makes more money than me ,NOT
why havent they entered the argument of availability its just the ability on coming in on days off and the ability to do longer hours,NOT
sooo over this vegan trend yawn boring love me some meat hunnnny,NOT
thank you for putting that in perspective it all makes so much more sense,NOT
yessss i really hope the vegan lifestyle works out for you i have never clicked a video so fast you go girl,NOT
i went vegan because i cant support what their doing to these poor animals and our planet,NOT
i love watching vegan videos but when every vegan video has a nonvegan ad before it it makes me really annoyed its gotten past just being a coincidence its every freaking vegan video,NOT
can u pls do a video on fungbros they just did a disgusting video on bbq meat and it was extremely graphic,NOT
this wont last  weeks trish hasnt done her homework im not a vegan crusader but trish is just going head first for quick snack fixes none of these things she has shown are meals,NOT
riced cauliflower and beans are my go to meal,NOT
inafter angry mostly white guys who are triggered by the idea that anyone other than them might actually enjoy less privilege and consideration than they do look angry altrighters and misogynists you dont need to give anything up by admitting that the tables are stacked in your favor it doesnt reflect poorly on you it simply means that like a rational person would you acknowledge that white dudes have an easier time of it than anyone else because historically thats been literally indisputably true im the child of two white lawyers who are very successful but guess what they recognize how advantaged they are and fight to end things like income inequality based on race and recognize that things like institutional racism are real things again you mustnt give up anything privelege race identity politics and basic human decency arent zero sum games,NOT
its so sad how women are expected to look after the kids this is bad for men and women,NOT
shes not vegain anymore ,NOT
this is fucking bullshit xd dont believe her,ABU
i really dont understand how everyone can just forget all the nasty shit freelee has said about them and everyone else and just pretend shes cool why is everyone all over her ass all of the sudden trisha shane julien  jenna and most importantly why are there no shitty conspiracy videos about this seriously though what gives am i missing something,NOT
im glad im so goddamn far left so i can enjoy these videos id hate to be a republican right now,NOT
just a couple dudes wearing halloween costumes for life,ABU
that chick is so totally ridiculous and she does make a mockery out of trans people ,NOT
and if you need delicious vegan recipes you can check indian cooking channels we have been vegetarian forever,NOT
they also dont count industries where women make more per hour than men,NOT
girl starbucks does vegan right you can get any drink just ask for coconut milk and no whip also you have to check out morning star chick patties so good,NOT
great content  govegan,NOT
its not like women were made to take care of children,ABU
no printer just faxx d,NOT
the way you smile when trisha says im going vegan ,NOT
you are thin wow trish i agree,NOT
then dont wear so much makeup and you wont look like a drag queen,NOT
i would say you can only eat as much as you want if you eat raw or with no vegan junk food but always make sure you are eating enough you wont feel good if you under eat you can always get a nutrition app to check if you are getting enough calories it can be very helpful there are many variations of this diet so dont feel like you have to stick with one if its not working for you experiment and have fun wish you the best in your journey,NOT
nobody ever talks about this problem honestly    not one publication has the balls to say what needs to be said the earning gap is womens fault,ABU
suck it up princes  or princesses whatever,NOT
dang a prageru video with a  liketodislike ratio i never thought id see the day welldone,NOT
cuz most women arent good at business but men are,NOT
pinterest has a lot of amazing meal ideas and a good source of protein are beans love you,NOT
if employers could get away with paying women less for doing the exact same job no one would ever hire men people make exactly what they earn,NOT
yea both of these guys have an unfair advantage even if they undergo hormone therapy so transgenders can race other transgenders but not real women dont blame the people who have an actual point,NOT
now you may wonder why jobs that are historicaly woman jobs have lower pay,NOT
beans and tofu fake chicken nuggets veggie burgers,NOT
lots and lots of nuts and edamame soy beans for protein fruits and veggies dont make you feel full for very long,NOT
trisha you have other issues and confusion with your body and sex but i dont think you are trans i think therapy would help i think it is because you were made fun of you feel confused and is why you need attention from your partners i mean that in the kindest and sweetest way some people not saying you are realize they have been sexually abused and once they get help then deal with issues i am a sex abuse advocate so no shame we blame the perpetrators not the victim,NOT
last time i saw these freaks mothafuckas one of them had a s porn mustache growing it is so nice to see them both freshly shaved clever bastards lmao,ABU
i am a degreed engineer though ive moved to it  of mechanical engineering students were female whereas  of industrial engineers were women in part because men were better at simply visualizing the shapes in advanced calculus classes while industrial had more accounting and data analysis and was closer to the average womans talents you still had to pass thermodynamics material science etc but more of the courses played on womens strengths,NOT
rest in peppermint blaires last two brain cells ,NOT
gardein products are amazing and taste exactly like meat my favorite are the chicken nuggets,NOT
the  of people who would eat meat if they had to slaughter it themselves is so low it wouldnt even be a thing to register,NOT

please freelee invite trisha to live with you otherwise she wont mak it would be fun to watch videos about it,NOT
vegans are losing traction soooo fast worst nutritional advise ever,NOT
google did a study in thier own business and found out they were paying women more ,NOT
curious to know if the study showing the shrinking gender wage gap in older women took into account women who left the work force to raise their children and never made it back in,NOT
potatoes rice quinoa and apples,NOT
incredible  proud to be a vegan,NOT
these are all imaginary problems this shows your life is so good you worried about the stupidest things,NOT
omg thai food and indian food have amazing vegetarian options so definitely check that out if youre not going full vegan,NOT
trans women can say they are real women in writing but in real life their bodies will never have the hormones and body of a biological woman,ABU
this is rediculous start a trans league and move on its not fair,ABU
every day we stray further from god,NOT
i graduated geomatic engineering with honors and have spent a decade in my industry up to several months ago i worked for a firm where two young men were employed one with a years experience the other with two years experience one failed his program the other nearly failed his program one made more than me and one earned the same as me i had substantially more responsibilities than either of them i have dealt with this almost my entire career and have even been told by companies that they do not hire females for my position i dont know what kind of nonsense youre reading but maybe you should talk to women who work in an engineering field and hear their firsthand experiences about an overwhelming wage gap and predominant sexism in the industry,NOT
perhaps we should ask why the overwhelming femalefilled fields get paid so little in the first place for instance why does our society place so little economic value on education a female dominated field if one studies the history of waged labor the genesis of capitalism and womens roles within that system we see that all of the work that has ever been womens work gets paid less because we think it is worth less sometimes not even paid for at all as is in the case of domestic house work i am calling upon michel foucaults analysis of s europe and the rise of capitalism and waged labor as is talked about in the history of sexuality volume  silvia federici also talks about this in chapter  of caliban and the witch women were subjugated into the economic machine as unpaid domestic labor while the work of men was waged this gave men the power to feed and house themselves and their wives while the women had no power of independence from their husbands because they couldnt make money that legacy continues on today in a world where we still feel on some level that womens work should be free pragerus analysis also doesnt mention how women cant just move to other cities because they are tied down by dependent children and other social roles within families that men are not as often entangled in this is another arena of unpaid womens work that is brushed aside and made invisible within the realm of the private sphere as opposed to the waged public sphere within which men more often work and of course there is the well known fact that stem areas are not always welcoming spaces to women and in fact can be quite hostile do we all remember the google employee who argued that women are biologically less capable of stem work than men a video that prageru itself also produced and distributed the hypocrisy and can we not recognize the role of generalized misogyny in all of this as well being a woman entails being in a world where you are constantly sexualized from the time you hit puberty perhaps even earlier most women recount the first time that they were sexually hit upon by a man at about the age of  in an executive world dominated by men we have seen that women are often objectified and sexualized rather than treated as human subjects peers and creators of worth this is a fact that has been increasingly uncovered within the metoo movement perhaps we should talk about the psychological impact of having a boss or professor that sexualizes you and how that impacts your academic and career choices and there lies the key word choices the idea of pure choice is an illusion often harked upon by the right wing and the neoliberal minded the idea that you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps something that literally defies the natural laws of physics and that the psychological reality of living within a patriarchical world as a woman is inconsequential and effortlessly surmountable as much as you glorify the individual who can defy the odds the sociological fact is that you end up with this  cents on the dollar statistic across the board again perhaps its not that women choose low paying jobs but perhaps that a the material reality of patriarchy does in fact push women towards certain career choices and b the more woman that enter a field the less those jobs pay in the end of the day there needs to be a better reconciliation between the feminist academia and right wing think tanks like prageru these ideas do need to spar head on because without direct contradiction it seems like either side can pick and choose statistics and theories to prove whatever point they want to make case and point being this video i think the arguments i made here validly complicate the above video and in fact nullify most of its arguments that women earning less is because they choose to,NOT
so basically the wage gap is real but only because our society still hasnt figured out that womens purpose isnt to care for the kids,NOT
am i the only person who thinks trish looks better than freely ,NOT
blaire is so iconic to get chickfila,NOT
while this is all true it doesnt question why jobs that are primarily male occupied are paid more than jobs that are female occupied why are teachers paid less than say advertisers because this is capitalism and your value is determined by your contribution to the flow of money out of consumers pockets into the hands of the top  if you can make money for the biggest companies that are all controlled by just a few hundred people either by creating a product marketing that product through the media or by being an influential actor or athlete or by altering the publics view of your company in a positive way then you will be rewarded with a big paycheck many govt jobs are male dominated as well but why dont women gravitate to these higher paying jobs as often as men because of gender roles instilled in us since birth men are told at an early age to be tough not show emotion be confident and that their worth is determined by their personal drive to succeed and be the breadwinner woman are told either directly or indirectly through the media to be nurturing respectful not be too loud or else be called bossy or a bitch and that their appearance is what matters some of these things are less extreme than in past years and more women are entering stem fields but turn on a tv and its clear they are still common tropes society shapes who we become and the choices we make and its clear that white men are in the highest positions of power in this country and decide what we see and hear in our daily lives why would they not push messages that keep them in power just look at trump and his rich white male cabinet another thing to consider is that when women do end up in male dominated fields such as the oil business they are often harrassed and considered inadequate for the job this video also ignores the study that found when two identical resumes are submitted to employers with the names john smith or jane smith john gets hired more often this video is too simple for such a complex problem,NOT
they keep speak on they hearts and feelings sports is about the physical and i mean look at they legs how much muscle and how toned you may feel like a women but those are man legs,NOT
this is dope as hell,NOT
aint gay but that pink kitchen theme is adorable,NOT
why is everyone saying vegans are cruel to people for not being vegan when whoever pays for animal products is indirectly being cruel to animals and paying for animal cruelty,NOT
yeah it so changing sure when i go to the store half of the products are meat or dairy lol u aint changing shitt and never will people dont give a horse shit about animals simple as that and we will keep eating it forever just because snowflakes go vegan doesnt mean the real meat eaters are eating less just  isnt eating meat anymore yes  not  not  no  of the world is vegan if not less gl beating the  as the  gl with that one,ABU
if i was an employer and i could get away paying women less why woudnt i just employ all women lol save me money logic,NOT
 years young and  years vegan  im happy and proud ,NOT
so its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,NOT
veganism  save the voiceless animals the world and yourself,NOT
its just amazing to see how happy freelee were,NOT
i think you should just focus on being yourself,NOT
read some minimalist baker recipes and vegan junk food so you wont miss it,NOT
lol yeah snap chat was different but i still luv u ,NOT
you live in a free country woman are allowed to earn less if they want they are allowed to earn more if they want if they want to be a ceo and have kids unless the man takes care of them it wont work u cant have it all and thats okay,NOT
no shit they break records they are boys competing against girls,ABU
eat rice beans whole wheats along with fruits and veggies and you should be good best of luck trish,NOT
wait this liberal video just debunked itself there is a wage gap because women choose less hours it literally said that lmaooo,NOT
cant wait for your veggie grill muckbang  start exploring the vegan restaurants in la trisha omg girl you gotta try donut friend if you havent yet ,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that it doesnt exist,NOT
yas trisha keep eating fruit because your body does this awesome thing where it takes amino acids and turns it into protein,NOT
talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice its my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legallybinding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality given the fact that lawmakers ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation,NOT
dear miss trisha your a complete joke and are a shameyou dont have gender dysphoria you literally just make videos to make your audience feel bad for you hope you can bind those big melons cause they might burst,ABU
so when you account for different choices men and women make it becomes  cents so what about those  cents whats the explanation for that,NOT
rice and pasta these will be more substantial and will keep you full chickpeas are great too they can be eaten as bean hummus falafel etc,NOT
give this woman a cookie,NOT
some were in australia there is a banana girl doing back flips lol,NOT
did you notice that the reasons you mentioned for men receive more work longer hours willing to relocate available at any time are directly associated with sexism once women take more of the unpaid work as cleaning and child care they cant be working lower hours,NOT
even though all of this is destroying womens sports its all about equality so quit your complaining women haha,NOT
women only recently joined the work force full time about  to  years and its unsustainable germany japan italy poland korea united states spain and many more countries have shrinking population yes in the short term it may work and even good economically but the birthrates are way too low every generation the population shrinks and so does the economy other countries with traditional roles will eventually overtake the nontraditional roles countries and its happening now muslim countries are immigrating to europe and latin america is immigrating to the united states,NOT
the beeping is going to give me an aneurism,NOT
i tried really hard to watch this even though it was the first time i ever heard of trisha i couldnt stand to look at her so i minimized the window and managed to get through the video thanks blaire,NOT
nothing doing just fucking disgusting these trans people think they deserve everything because they are trans fuck off,ABU
what the actual fuck is going on in this video,ABU
 bitch watch your second channel you look crazy right now no one has to go to your second channel to see youre a mess hell even stevie wonder could see youre a crazy mess ,ABU
thank you from the bottom of my heart  go green and promote veganism ,NOT
trisha fruit is awesome but please dont forget that you can eat potatoes pasta and bread there so much more than fruit that will really satisfy you please educate yourself on vegnaism because it seems as though you havent fully researched the vegan diet and lifestyle,NOT
this is just so absurd that it makes me wonder i weep for the future ferris buellers day off,NOT
youre a terrible person and a disgrace a shame to the lgbtq community youre clearly not trans youre an attention seeking liar,ABU
i think this person recording this video thinks vegan is a religion ,NOT
checkout her latest video she is not vegan lol,NOT
trisha well i have to make money to move somehow ,NOT
basically they are saying leave it up to the men and stay at the house,NOT
so basically women like taking care of their kids,NOT
christina hoff sommers once again with the knowledge bombs,NOT
hey trish im totally the same i went vegan for two months before i switched over being a vegetarian for the last few months its hard for me because i used to really enjoy chicken but since being vegetarian ive found so many fake chicken options the best is the buffalo wings from morning star they taste like chicken nuggets and not wings but i would say the things that helps me the most is potatoes rice and pasta i could down a whole pot of rice mmmm so yummy i also currently weigh  lbsbut i can tell you this i have not looked  lbs since changing my diet the numbers on the scale get people down but the way you look should motivate you rather than the number i feel healthier than ever before and i think you will some amazing results i feel it,NOT
summary women get off your ass and get an education so you can get paid the same,NOT
if this is true from trish  this didnt happen due to freelees usual bullying video this only happened after a nice collab effort like normal human beings no freelees approach still doesnt work  she said vegan for  weeks there is no such thing  isnt that basically plant based,NOT
so allow woman to work whatever shifts they want ya that wont negatively effect the business landscape look the wage gap is a myth i wont beat a dead horse im just so sick of hearing about it,NOT
up in  the wage gap doesnt exist its basically what job you have and if what kind of position you have at that job such as manger or co manger or janitor or cashier an pc men or more willing to do overtime if your not on salary and most of these points are when woman were allowed to be paid less so the wage gap is just another bullshit feminist reason to start problems yes you are right it did exist then but now its impossible or if it happens its most likely jail time i but tbh i just want triggered femnazis saying the wage gap is still that thing in the comments lel,NOT
trisha when she needs to pay rent,NOT
amazing video thank u very much lets hope for a vegan future,NOT
yesssssss trish omg so exciting if youre trying to lose weight definitely do your best to stay away from oil and salt,NOT
you can get frappuccinos with soy milk,NOT
idk why anyone is worrying about what this trisha girl says she literally thought dogs didnt have brains  shes not worth the effort shes just stupid as fuck she doesnt know what transgender even means you guys should be nice to her she obviously has brain damage,ABU
she has already broken it,NOT
yaaaas so proud of you girl ,NOT
wait icecream testing is a job im in,NOT
my ducking teacher is a liar,NOT
what is this world coming too seems for hundreds of years boys competed against boys now all of a sudden the queers pretend they are girls and want to compete against them,ABU
tryna find a feminist complaining in the comments,NOT
also my cousin dosent wear leather,NOT
im here from freelee just wanna say i dont follow your channel but im still very proud of you going vegan is a big change even if its only for  weeks its a brave move and im sure youre going to love it best of luck to you trish,NOT
they have such a bad camera position for these videos they need a side view to really show how far ahead they are,NOT
im confused with this vid,NOT
nahthem some dudes with wigs ,ABU
did she just call me a banana bitch,NOT
this shit is pathetic,NOT
i wonder why people care what gender makes more or less at the end of the day male and females husband and wife bring the money back to the household and spend it together i mean seriously why do you woman think that we men work so hard we work hard to provide for our family and give them a better future if we only thought of ourselves trust me we would work  days a week and party  days,NOT
who would expect a conservative group to consider every fact right me neither all the arguments that try to explain why there isnt any wage gap miss out one thing of course you know that but you constantly manage to ignore it women have to give birth and therefore  need a stable environment  cant just be available   cant just move around the world as firms want them to i consider a loving father to say the same things but as workers need to get more flexible because the companies are outsourcing their risk to the employees men have to addict to such injustices the real problem is the worker unfriendly workplace,NOT
i feel like this is trish trolling,NOT
this is so ignorant and ridiculous pretty sure i lost half my remaining braincells the moment trisha started talking,ABU
good job freelee ,NOT
what the fucks wrong with her face how did she add a chromosome,ABU
shane needs to step up now haha,NOT
your body will likely not transform in two weeks but eating mostly fruit and veggies will do wonders for your skin and digestion that said somebody else in the comments said not to eat only raw fruit and veg to start and id agree cause it will probably be too abrupt a change to stick to if you seriously want to try out the diet and help your health and aesthetics long term id start by going to vegan restaurants and trying well prepared vegan meals even the ones with fake meats cheese etc if youre adventurous and eating fruit and veg at home also it would be a good idea to allow yourself some vegan sweets as a transition im not a vegan activist and im not writing this to you because of your reach ive been dealing with disordered eating on and off for the last  years and since i went vegan some  months ago so much in my body and mind has changed for the better yes ive lost a bit of fat too and i hope it does for you too good luck,NOT
hey im sick of this your a boy get over it thats how god made you,ABU
i cook steamed rice and slow cook baby potatoes i season the potatoes and mix it with the rice i then put sriracha with the rice and its amazing  hopefully this helps  so proud of you,NOT
im vegan but not a climate alarmist is there any actual proof that over  species are going extinct each day ,NOT
i just recently found out what happened inside of slaughter house a few days ago and i honestly feel sick i am  and i have always ate meat but i really want to become vegan after what i saw do you have any tips,NOT
here are some factors on why men tend to earn more   men choose higher paying jobs women tend to focus on jobs caring for others  teachers nurses daycare home health workers etcwhile men enjoy stem fields which are higher paying  men put in more hours at work than women do and therefore are earning more if paid by the hour or earn more in commissions for making more sales  because men put in more hours and maybe work nights and weekends they get more experience and are therefore more valuable which justifies pay raises and promotions  women often leave the workforce to have kids this means that whenif they return they have to start from scratch while the men who were hired originally with the women have been promoted  women arent as aggressive in negotiating their pay when hired andor promoted nor are they as aggressive in seekingdemanding promotions  women are more likely to stay with a company that turned them down for a raisepromotion they are risk adverse men are less afraid of risk and will look elsewhere if they are passed over for a promotion or are denied a raise companies know this and therefore are more likely to give men that raisepromotion rather than face the higher risk of them leaving  since women work less than men companies arent going to offer women promotions if the promotion would require them to work longer hours women wont accept such promotions as often as men and the companies know that she is likely to turn it down so they offer it to the equally qualified man rather than having the man knowing that he was the nd choice  since women tend to seek husbands who earn more than they do women are much more likely to have a higher earning spouse than a man this means that the women will be less likely to accept a promotion requiring more timetravel since she may not need the money as much as the man with a lower earning spouse the womans husband is also less likely to accept the wife being on the job more hours and he will also be less willing to move if the womans promotion requires it he may not be able to make the same money if the new town while the spouse of the male employee will be much more likely to find similar paying work these factors discourage women from accepting such promotions and knowing this the company is also less likely to offer it to a woman over an equally qualified man  women with higher earning husbands feel less pressure to enter less attractive but higher paying fields they gravitate to jobs that they like men tend to have lower earning spouses and therefore are forced to choose higher paying jobs even if its much less enjoyable all of the above show why men on an annual basis earn more than women there is nothing that attributes the difference to sexism its all about personal choices that men and women freely make,NOT
and the most ecofreindly diet of  is  canibalism xd,NOT
u go girl,NOT
sounds like trisha is just possessed by her animus it happens,NOT
i like how freelee started to put graphic at the end of her titles so i am warned,NOT
everyone at my job including  men and  women make  an hour ive seen a female coworkers paycheck looks the same as mine,NOT
trisha just because you are fugly doesnt mean you can change sex ugly as a woman ugly as a man god insanity abounds,ABU
yeah theyre happy they win the prizes and scholarships and all and we all are altruistic who feel just happy of peoples success even when its unfair ,NOT
if only countries governments and institutions could address their social problems in this manner they might end up at least moving in the right direction discussing problems like this might not guarantee an ideal solution but it certainly paves way for improvement and helps reducing redundancies,NOT
how can you close something that doesnt even exist,NOT
hahaha this bitch has an add before this video shes making money off of this shes just mentally ill go get help trisha,ABU
the  dislikes are from people who watched until the part when she said the wage gap doesnt exist clicked and left lol,NOT
thats a nice microwave,NOT
this was a paid spot trisha just did it for money and views and freelee just did it to try to save her repuation,NOT
todo lo mostrado en este documental est basado en pases desarrollados pero creo que tambin debera de poner ms nfasis en pases en subdesarrollo en estos pases se tiene la creencia de que este estilo de vida sustentable es muy caro espero que en estos pases se logre algn cambio y poco a poco el veganismo se haga ms conocido,NOT
she also said she was a meth addict not long ago for those who say that when a person tells you what they really are you have to believe them and no hunty if jonathan yaniv came and told me hes trans i wouldnt believe and never will that only keeps paving the way for creeps and pedophiles trisha should be aware of this issue and not troll with certain things shit is tough as it is today and theres no need to add layers to it,NOT
yay welcome make sure u have a lot of egg less milk less noodle stir frys pasta with tomatoes and veggies rice potatoes i personally love them with leaks its beautiful try vegan chicken and vegan sausage  but make sure it has no milk or eggs,NOT
you will close the wage gap between genders to  if you are as productive as men,NOT
they decided to compete against girls because theyre nothing against their own peers,ABU
this is beyond ridiculous in no universe should they be able to compete against these girls its completely unfair to those girls like really you are telling me that today dressed as a boy i cant join the girls team but if i come back tomorow and say i decided im a girl now balls a swinging then its free game get real the fact this is even up for discussion is laughable i identify as a millionaire so apparently somebody needs to pay me so my feelings dont get hurt,ABU
its one of those things where either of the two decisions causes problems they should figure out which has the least negative impact,NOT
i give this less than  hours,NOT
just realized that now she says hi to zac efron instead of rick morranis xd,NOT
on the other hand they can believe whatever they want just to feel better about themselves,NOT
you can do it trish but remember to get complex carbs like rice wheat and legumes to help with dairy cravings eat fruits like avocado and nuts to satisfy that high fat craving good luck,NOT
i also gained soooo much weight after i stopped eating meat because i also replaced all the meat with food that wasnt so good for me  im just now starting to lose it but i do feel the best ive ever felt despite all of the weight ive gained lol,NOT
i would share this but i would get flamed by the women on my socials kinda sad,NOT
ive always heard that when switching over to a vegan diet you gain weight before you lose any because your body is getting use to it so if this is to lose weight before a music video maybe now isnt the best time i duno,NOT
ugh i cant with this one drag queen and a gay man,NOT
potatoes and rice are my staples  they are lifeeeeee especially for someone who lives somewhere where you cant get a ton of fresh fruit,NOT
translation men and women earn the same for equal work but we still need to fight the wage gap thanks vox,NOT
what in the juwanna man is going on here,NOT
by saying that she identifies as female one day and male the next is she trying to say shes genderfluid,NOT
people still sms ,NOT
and dont say they sat down with a track star,NOT
man i think shehe is just confused ab herhis gender heshe doesnt have to like going by theythem but heshe should take some time to figure shit out,NOT
from  women financial independence was like   in  years from  to  every  rich men there are  women rich so you cant deny that fact the modernisation helpd women to get in entrepreneur world in east women work in technology in building structure in eary tough jobs like men fao said  of poor people not children not men not old people theyre women fao un also confirmed  of worker in clothing factory farming land recycling technology or garbage are women so stop laying pride kills your manhood and your humanity im bank manager my salry is k a year but my male friends in the same job with the same degree with same year experience he make k a year i cant respect you if you dont respect my rights flapping that as if world against you and give you half what i get or imagine if you been a women come on be a fair,NOT
do vegans eat fish,NOT
this does not account for the fact that it is more likely that men work overtime and therefore deserve a promotion in jobs and pay,NOT
women can only make more money than men in one job stripping,NOT
its like what trump said youre gonna make as much if you do as good of a job,NOT
 i feminist cant take facts,NOT
the only thing women are better at then men is giving birth changing nappies and ironing men are better at everything else thats why men are paid more,ABU
i am missing something or should the pay gap just be determined on the pay men and women get for the same job if you get the median from both genders how is it going to be the same by this logic there is a  wage gap between asians and blacks in america that should be a outrage right,NOT
yes girl dont give up everyday is a new day to restart and every little change you make counts my favorite vegan options are jackfruit tacos frozen bananas sweet potato  black bean burgers pesto potatoes  zucchini chips  guac there are sooooo many delicious recipes you dont have to starve yourself and remember dont beat yourself up when you slip its all about the progress,NOT
makeup doesnt make u any less or more of a woman,NOT
i think she just identifies as a mental breakdown,NOT
the transgender issue is being pushed on us they want to created a genderless raceless religionless society,NOT
okay um how many ads do you need on a video to have a kitchen remodel i could smell microwave ramen just looking at it,NOT
the video i was waiting for yaaaaaaaaaaassssssss ,NOT
you can still have almond milk and other milk alternatives more delicious,NOT
you are doing the work of god,NOT
male football players distort the average earnings of men and women,NOT
one way i love to eat brussel sprouts is to take the leave kind of things rip em off put some salt on them put them in the oven and make brussel sprout chips,NOT
yes babe you can eat any rice and potatoes too carb up,NOT
youre so cute trish ,NOT
two women two kitchens no sandwiches,NOT
there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap that could be solved through just working more hours,NOT
yea the wage gap is a perfect example of statistics being interpreted to suit someones needs its this fallback point that everyone uses cause it seems so unfair and they always use stats from degree educated people that work in still sexist fields of work the vast majority of people work for minimum wage and you dont see mcdonalds paying a woman c on the dollar just because of her gender she makes the same crap wage as the men there also men have a way higher rate of depressioninjurysuicides at work cause they work themselves to death so their wife and kids wont leave them and shack up with a guy with a better paying job,NOT
okay but does she truly know what it means to be transgender,NOT
trish says shes trans bc she likes short hair trishas therapist sorry sister u gotta get a new therapist,NOT
for protein i make quinoa and brown rice on a weekly basis gardein has really yummy fake chicken not super healthy but a nice treat if you have a craving the beauty of a vegan diet to me is that i eat until im satisfied but dont experience the pain and exhaustion of overeating food my body struggles to digest dairy is a hard one to give up especially cheese to me the cheese replacements are a bit pungent i personally like sauted mushrooms as an alternative the most important thing is to remember that we are all doing the best we can and wherever this journey leads you we have to have respect for one anothers choices,NOT
fresh fruit is yummo but be careful even tho they have natural sugar its still sugarcarrots are loaded with sugar too fresh veggiessalads,NOT
girl get you some rice quinoa potatoes legumes corn pasta get them carbssssa,NOT
there are so many wrong logical pathways in this video email me at bmartinacom so we can talk about it,NOT
girlyou are a true messyou are not transyou seem to know nothing about itread a book,NOT
cant wait till this earth is destroyed,NOT
very well said christina,NOT
those who claim that for the same work women are paid  cents on the dollar compared to man in the other hand are not merely bad at math but at telling the truth bam give this woman an award,NOT
tofu is very good for protein i prefer to fry the tofu but its very good for you to be vegan,NOT
what about the law that bans discrimination in any form in the workplace this also includes money earned why does no one bring this up you can literally search it on google,NOT
vegan is not a diet,NOT
if the wage gap does exist why doesnt all people who own companys just fire all men to save money,NOT
whats that i hearangry feminists that wont admit they are wrong,NOT
ive been watiniign for this since like yesterday yay,NOT
this transgender thing is an illusion ,ABU
gee  boys beat a bunch of girls athletically big surprise this is pathetic and if it doesnt stop you might as well end all female sports in high schools let the shemales race each other,NOT
liking boy stuff does not make you trans bruh ,NOT
i was excited to hear your opinion on this hot mess of bleached hair and spray tan ,ABU
i too concluded this itd not only be ridicilous but a violation of human rights i mean come on telling a female engineer gone through the same studies alright this guy is going to earn k bucks but were only giving you k thats ridicilous,NOT
it is an unfair advantage wtf stop the denial and get on the boys team,NOT
im so proud of you trish i tried the vegan thing once and i lost like  pounds in a week without working out its so hard to stick to the diet but its definitely worth it,NOT
if trisha is able to go vegan everyone is,NOT
this is brilliant ,NOT
up next why black lives matter is a dangerous organisation as told by an actual black man,NOT
where the fuck is freelees comment,NOT
cmon vox youre on the right trackish but what a terrible summary basically  wage gap isnt as black and white as people think it is its more that society is still aimed at women being primary caregivers and men being breadwinners so the opportunities they have are different  its not a case of paying equal wage for same jobhours because thats not the issue the solution is to start having better procedures in place for maternity leave  less discrimination against females around the age they have kids  more men taking paternity leave etc you kinda touched on it a bit but i feel like you spent too much time going indepth into the studies instead of talking about the theory of it which is a pretty big part of the research itself,NOT
failing the plan is planning to fail if you actually want to succeed you have to do research find recipes and restaurants and buy a lot more groceries than that,NOT
yes d great step trisha im supporting you   i knew you had it in you  i have been vegan for  weeks now and i feel amazing so i hope the same happens to you girl,NOT
lol once i saw vox was the uploader i immediately think bias im out,NOT
this is a shame what is the world coming to,NOT
gay man isnt a third gender,NOT
wow they just had to get a woman to say this didnt they,NOT
i hope all these people are pro life withlove for life they preach,NOT
ive never seen this video before im shocked to hear someone other than a youtuber or controversial figure actually talking about this i applaud this video,NOT
someone left a comment on her video and it was so true identifying with men is not the same as identifying as a man,NOT
great girl but get enough calories in beans brown rice whole grain pasta lentils stews with coconut milk and zucchini etc an awesome meal is taco filled with veggies and falafel but dont forget going vegetarian or vegan is a process especially if youve been a meat lover for a long time so dont get discouraged if you cheat one day just keep going and soon you wont crave animal products at least that was my experience good luck girl,NOT
vegan and believing we have to change or ways and systems however why the hell do you use greta in this video,NOT
men and women earn the same money in all regulated industry if women get less money its because they do less work its as simple as that a real way of looking at the statistic at the beginning of the video is women on average only do  of the overall work that men do on average,NOT
youre a dude who in the hell said its ok to race with girls,ABU
wait did she say shes a gay man,NOT
you have to eat lots of beans rice and pasta and smoothies because you have to eat enough or you will fail,NOT
i thought i was the only one who ate frozen grapes but i usually only eat them when my braces make my teeth hurt,NOT
both of them sound like dudes compete with the guys,ABU
this is vodka btw lmaaaaaoo,NOT
what i dont understand is why there are women that get angry when you tease them for being a house wife when that is literally the best lifestyle you could possibly get,NOT
nooo freelee is awfull but ilysm dont look at her body as a goal,NOT
 dislikes but still no comments of feminists defending their point why because they dont have one,NOT
as a conservative this is the best feel good video for me,NOT
i was in love with my gay bff i was happy he felt comfortable coming out to me  being true but i loved him a very sad time for my  year old heart,NOT
trisha i love you respect you and care for you i think youre thinking a little too much into this,NOT
youre not trans you dont have gender dysphoria stop appropriating being transgender its not fun,NOT
so since youre going vegan mainly for health reasons which is awesome anyways i hope it works out great  here are some more healthy options for food but if you want anything more indulgent check out the chancel hot for food it has epic recipes protein  beans soy products  tofu tempeh  they are best if marinated or quickly in done in a tofu scramble  quinoa seating more complex meat substitute its basically gluten and more difficult in my opinion to prepare  dont be afraid of protein powders if thats your thing try out soy pea or hemp protein another channel with great meals is the vegan corner which provides more healthy recipes  breakfast ideas  smoothie bowls oatmeal tofu scramble breakfast burritos vegan yoghurt with fruit though i dont know any good american brands banana icecream pancakes lunch  dinner  salads pasta sushi bowls baked potato with some toppings soup sandwiches chow cheese is the best from what ive heard veggies and tofu stir fry veggie lasagne good luck ,NOT
trishalisten you are beautifultalented and much better than freeleyou dont need to be like her her body is kindaughhh something i wouldnt like to haveor ve jealous ofyou are curvy and sexy and you dont need veganism to be beautifulif you really want to change your body listen to blogilates,NOT
personally i think we need governments to push for all to eat less and less meat dairy eggs rather than push that people go  vegan straight away yes we all need to go  vegan but so many folk out there are so feckin stupid and obstinate they will only change if they can keep some meat then with time we need to push for all of them to go the whole way it might not be how we wish people would change but i think its more realistic health wise though this vegan meat substitutes may be better for the earth which is great but they certainly arent better for us and our own survival,NOT
you actually look very skinny i this video,NOT
why do i get the feeling this women isnt really for menlol,NOT
at the end of the day you are a boy wtf is wrong with ppl its not fair so next they gonna be saying why cant we carry children in the wombwtf cause you dont have one you man this is crazy,ABU
it cant be technically correct with all the differences to many facts keep it from being correct thats like saying all men are rapists because of the few men who did commit rape but the gap between the  that never committed that crime and the  that did can be explained while still saying technically all men are still rapists,NOT
you literally make me so madddd lmfao youre so fake,ABU
make sure you eat a lot of beans grains and veggies also add hemp seeds to everything dont forget to take b good luck,NOT
once this bitch and a lot of others get off this platform itll be so much better,NOT
they still slow,NOT
if your just starting out you should buy all the gardein products and a vitamix,NOT
important to note that women make less in jobs with flexible hours because they work less hours statistically speaking not calling women lazy just statistically lazy ,NOT
lmao unfair biological advantage since they hit puberty before they decided to pretend to be female,ABU
lentil curry and veganindian food in general is so good that you forget its vegan filling the hunger with watermelon helped my lose lbs i went from  to  depends on if i ate out a lot,NOT
um its because there are more men workers than woman workers and they work more stupid liberal channel,NOT
im genuinely surprised that gender studies was not among the  worst paying college majors ,NOT
how trendytrisha trolls again,NOT
she literally freaked me out at  ,NOT
i just watched the from farm to fridge and was crying from minute one and cant stop since then im in so much pain for these animals and ive seen videos like that before which made me sick to my stomachs but as of now i am truly wanting to go vegan or at least vegetarian so you probably will not pay any mind to this but for this being one of my first videos ive watched of yours i have to say thank you for opening my eyes like no one else has,NOT
you guys dont have any videos about adoption,NOT
they arent girls  they need a trans team its as simple as that,ABU
 is such a mood i have that mood every time a bitch said something to me that was stupid,NOT
hats off to that mother that spoke out she is right these men should not be competing against real women it is so so unfair,ABU
im sooo excited about this i have went and subbed to tricia and wrote her giving her support my daughter and i both went vegan  months ago thanks to you freelee and gary yourofsky combined  im vegan for the animals but i dont really care why someone goes vegan  just as long as they do im happy im just so thrilled tricia has you to help her i think tricia does have a good heart she just had the blinders on like we all did until we found our way to a vegan lifestyle and now that hers are off great things are in store for her and i couldnt be happier,NOT
why she lie blaire what motivates that,NOT
you could try watermelon mango pasta rice beans mushrooms etc,NOT
last year during my senior year of highschool we had a test in my economics class one of the questions was what are the reasons for the gender wage gap i wrote that is doesnt exist my teacher failed me,NOT
be vegan forever,NOT
i know trish often does any and everything for clickbaitbutwhat if she reeeeaaaallly feels this way why does she get shot down when ive seen trans people who have more of the right look or woke rhetoric to go with their commentary pretty much say the same thingsshe feels like both why is this causing issues if she were skinny and androgynous looking people would totally call her brave for this,NOT
can someone please send me links for the two reports mentioned in the video i need proof to red pill some deluded feminists at my school,NOT
try gradien meat its at whole foods and other grocery stores they even have it at target but its a great starter for vegans in the beginning because it tastes so good ,NOT
trisha grew up in a misogynistic world and it shows,NOT
awesome video so proud of trisha id love it if you checked out my channel lots of vegan food on its way d,NOT
woman gets job at different employer that pays less than a man in the same job position at an employer that pays more thats sexist,NOT
if you have to pick between a male and a female with the same skills its better to pick the male because he wont have the possibility of having a payed month off because of being pregnant,ABU
is she really going vegan i mean is she going to stop going to seaworld,NOT
im  months pregnant and this morning i took a huge stink poop omg that means i must be a man ,NOT
k offended feminazis,ABU
did you even think this through please dont take decisions so fast without even thinking it though,NOT
men are more willing and able to work long hours without advanced notice and then there are some feminists who want to take sleep breaks at work while claiming there is a wage gap,NOT
no that isnt factually correct in the same field with the same work experience the same number of hours worked etc etc a woman earns the same well within a certain margin that is explainable by negotiation for pay men prioritise earnings more than anything else so they are tougher negotiating partners in most cases feminists would still be crying if it was  cents to the dollar  ps the gap is just all everything all men earn added up and everything women earn added up and then comparing the two it doesnt take into account that women often dont want to be engineers or in stemfields in general then again woman are also underrepresented among the physical laborers like trashmen not trashworkers but trashmen coalminers workers on oilrigs etc etc,NOT
yesssss subbed ,NOT
really proud the most important thing is to eat carbs dont be afraid of them sending lots support and love your way ,NOT
ffs you are a pathological liar how much did they pay you to push this bullshit agender,ABU
i just tried vegan  i lasted  days hahaha,NOT
quite sure women of my generation outearn men of my generation  the  graduation rate probably explains it,NOT
carb up girl you will love it rice pasta potatoes bananas and sugar have as much fruit and carbs as you want omg i am so excited,NOT
please get your head out of your ass,NOT
piers morgan is soooo arrogant,NOT
i think this video is well put for what it is i would like sources to back up the data in your video i also think that some of the reason the men care for their kids more is because it isnt possible for them most companys offer paid leave to women but none to men iirc thanks for reading thoughts,NOT
i identify as a person who always has a motorcycle attached to them while running in a track race so i should be allowed to race with the motorcycle which is a part of my body while on the track no unfair advantage there,NOT
man works for big business woman works at a gas station man makes more wage gap wage gap,NOT
of course the meat eaters react negatively eating meat makes them more confrontational using the reptilian brain that was not part of our original dna but put there the vegan has overcome that and shut it down we need to be careful to not fuel that divide and conquer mentality we need to stay calm and focused feeding this planet our higher vibrations so in turn we can liberate mother earth,NOT
trishi have bad newsyou cant drink when your vegan,NOT
 gender fluid gender fucking fluid mean this in a good way not bad,NOT
we need to grow food forests and jungles xx empty fields have so much more potential,NOT
this gives the information that is needed i am glad that for once vox has given some context to this subject with this proof that they understand the reasons i dont know how you can claim that there is something insidious behind this phenomenon,NOT
we need to be aware of this if were gonna close the wage gap the only way youre gonna close the  gap that feminist keep harping on about is to either force women into higher paying jobs they dont want or force men into lower paying jobs they dont want,NOT
so what im hearing is because you have more guy friends then girl friends because you think gay guys are attractive because you didnt like the attention from grown ass men when you were in middle school youre trans gender nice,NOT
liked  from malaysian vegetarian ,NOT
yaaaasssssss waiting for that vegan mukbang tho,NOT
theres a wage gap and income gap,NOT
veggie chickn is amazeballs good luck on your vegan journey,NOT
this video is great,NOT
she pushes the limits to see how much shit she can get away with bruh you sell your pussy online for red blooded males and say you dont like male attention fuck outta here,ABU
i loled at congratulations on your transition from female to female and this is vodka by the way you are the best youtuber ever ,NOT
this is a fucking joke,ABU
now freelee will stop giving trish so much shit because shes vegan now wow,NOT
your instagram link isnt working,NOT
i actually should sleeping right now but i just kept watching,NOT
im older than you and you look like youre  but yet you say things and speak like someone whose ,NOT
it is unfair but transgender boys and girls are told they can join their respective sides the problem isnt with these  great young athletes in sport sexes are divided to keep it fair if trans athletes have an advantage and are allowed to make all of the other girls look substandard why not just stop the separate sex events get all of the men women and trans athletes to run together everybody can have views and opinions but stop targeting these girls they are doing nothing that they havent been told they can do,NOT
there is no such thing as a gender wage gap there is a gender earnings gap big difference why is the onus always put on employers rather than the differing lifestyle and career choices women make to falsely portray women as victims to imply men get preferential treatment by employers come pay day thats all bullshit women can earn the same as men if they work as hard and as much simple really,NOT
there is no wage gap for like for like jobs,NOT
i subscribed just because of this video,NOT
trisha going vegan is like freelees lifes mission lol its awesome,NOT
great thanks a lot,NOT
ahhhhh trisha im so proud of you ive been watching your videos for  years now and i went vegan  weeks ago ive already lost  pounds ive struggled with my weight my whole life and now at  im making a change and i love it i thought i wouldnt last and neither did anyone else but my eyes are open now some good protein lacked foods are brand and nuts and green veggies definitely check out pinterest bc they have some amazing vegan recipes and im sure that you being in la will make it easier bc im from louisiana and its so hard with all the cattle around but its worth it i promise,NOT
so basically there is a average pay gap because women mostly choose lower paying jobs on average than men,NOT
you dont have to have dysphoria to be trans trish is still trolling tho,NOT
your face looks like its losing weight your looking great ,NOT
shes just attracted to gay men she wants an excuse to be able to sleep with them shes fetishizing gay men and trans men,NOT
to many videos on you tube what i eat on my day vegan,NOT
you have to be a male dressed as a woman because this is a lie the wage gap is true men have oppressed women for way too long its time for women to revolt this injustice,NOT
finally im not the only one who thinks the same,NOT
what about females having to grow children its more a problem of women not being able to have same carrier paths as man do because of their place in traditional society i think thats what real feminist not the extrimist ones fight for,NOT
jordan b peterson,NOT
pharmacy is a more female oriented profession and the hospital i work at for example all managerial positions within the pharmacy department is filled with women not only that but even the higher positions in the pharmacy are still female dominated,NOT
yeah looked this chick up shes a selfhating rightwing shill who suffers from classic stockholms syndrome nothing more to see here,ABU
this channel has their shit straight,NOT
i started a plant based diet in  now that im a medical doctor im sure is the best decision ive made ,NOT
your voice is so soothing love the video,NOT
back at it again on the kitchen floor can she afford chairs we shall never know,NOT
wait doesnt vox spout bullshit but this is all true,NOT
this vid was interesting for the first minute then all i heard was blah blah blah,NOT
when the carnivores came on camera and the second they opened their mouth i started laughing how can you think that vegan is a mental illness ,NOT
radical left is crazy,NOT
maybe the cisgendered women should boycott competing until transwomen get their own race then there wont be a competition to race in anyways for anyone until something changes cis gendered women need their own category period i also find it disgusting that people have reduced women to the level of estrogen or testosterone found in the body it takes much more than just hormone levels to create a woman after puberty everything from bone density to size and other important changes happen oh yeah remember the menstrual cycle that too women athletes often have to train so hard that they can even lose their periods which is unhealthy and transwomen who have not been through cisgendered female puberty say that if they just make sure the testosterone in their body is at a low enough level that they are biologically women and should compete with them this is madness hormone therapy is there to help someone feel like they are a woman it cannot actually turn you into one biologically it will not make you turn into the woman you would have been had you been through a female not male puberty i think trans people should be protected against violence but they are still not technically the women or men they feel that they are and do not need to be in the same category for sports why cant there be a transgender competition this is not like getting to use the ladies washroom that helps transwomen feel safer far away from potentially abusive cisgendered males this is about competing with cisgendered women scholarships are on the line here biology matters,NOT
its just biology having a kid is a choice a woman must make and yea there are consequences good and bad money isnt everything,NOT
she needs a doctor to exam her dam head lol,ABU
while i like the idea of reducing wage differences between sexes im deeply skeptical of increasing flexibility in many fields of work as flexibility often in practice means that the employee be available when the employer needs them and not that employees enjoy more selfdirection it might be true for highereducated professions but for working class people flexibility can simply be a euphemism for a business conveniently refusing to hire them full time so families have to resort to multiple parttime jobs in order to make ends meet sometimes with shortterm contracts and very uncertain employment conditions,NOT
someones rent must be due ,NOT
awesome great luck to them after their career in music fell apart i loved their song from back in the day girl you know its true keep going ladies,NOT
damn patriachy making this poor woman report this so they could save cents to the dollar shame,NOT
im a vegetarian and i really want to go vegan slowly cutting animal products at of my diet  but its hard  but still trying,NOT
boys have more testosterone wtf these are still guys they just got their dicks cut off and got bigger breasts theyre still guys jesus,ABU
there is no such thing as a damn transgender girl these are two men or boys in makeup and bruce jenner is just a damn man in a dress who changed his name to caitlyn period america is just a putrid den of iniquity with the most ridiculously psychotic perverse and insane group of humans on the entire planet,ABU
i love trish but i dont like you,NOT
i like how there was an assumption that the flexible hours issue was all because of a child dont mind the fact that more childless women still prefer to work a more standard time schedule than childless men or men with children yeah also there is an absolute crap ton of other reasons for the earnings gap,NOT
why dont we see any women who trans to men smashing any mens records ,NOT
i am sorry but feminists just dont believe in facts in reality most liberals are antiscience and reality adverse so you are going to have a hard time convincing them,ABU
sounds like she wants a haircut,NOT
imagine someone making up a gender bashing someone else for trying to make up another gender  like at this point the transgender community wants people to accept them but dont want to accept anyone else,NOT
shes mentally unstable and shell probably do an apology video about it unless its a troll video which i think is true too,NOT
vox always get it wrong,NOT
b a s e d m o m,NOT
soooo insulting to real trans people with dysphoria so insulting and just preposterous,NOT
its amazing your doing this trish routing for you i personally am a vegan and the most important thing to remember is that your not going to get slimmer anywhere without loads protein,NOT
i just had to make sure i hit thumbs down,NOT
i enjoyed the video and im not trying to be provocative but i have  sincere remarksquestions  individual choices happen in a context saying that men are more able than women to work longer hours or be on call doesnt take into account power relationships or cultural backgrounds eg i have a female friend who was offered a big promotion at he accountants office she almost didnt take it because it meant she wouldnt be able to be home for diner and she was afraid her husband wouldnt be able to cook and take care of the kids as it turned out he wasnt and she wakes up earlier every morning to cook dinner so that he just has to warm it up in this case if she had refused the job i totally agree that it would be absurd to say that the company was sexist but it seems as absurd to completely discard any type of sexism in the choices that some women make  how can we interpret the correlation between feminization of an occupation and lower wages in europe  years ago most medical doctors and academics were male now its shifting over and there are many more females in these occupations at the same time we notice that global wages for both men and women are in average  lower than what they used to be in those fields do you think it is merely a coincidence,NOT
ummmm no youre basically saying that not wanting to put on makeup and not wanting to do your hair in the morning means youre a boy and youre transgender you dont like the association with being a female because with being a female comes with all the standards and expectations that media has put upon us you dont like how you feel when you dont meet those hypothetical standards and people make comments and because men dont have that same problem as women youre trying to say youre a man im so sorry but thats not how it works at all,NOT
wait hold up how do you identify as ur natural born gender and then be trans like ur born a female and you said you identify as that but in every other part of the video you say you dont ,NOT
i thought this was obvious already,NOT
not shown in the video the ethnicity of women playing into it as well,NOT
k people disliked without watching the video assuming it was feminist propaganda,NOT
its funny how when you search wage gap in youtube this video isnt at the top despite having the most viewer traffic,NOT

i became vegan in  and i am happy for it and my sister keeps making fun of me,NOT
im sorry i have not heard of this thing called the wage gap is this possibly because it no longer exists,NOT
the issue with this is that they do not touch on why men get these jobs so much more than women its not like there arent women in these fields also they didnt touch on the biological aspect of the university majors all the maths and sciences get more money but men tend to have more of an affinity for maths and science while females tend to be better at the arts,NOT

go buy more bananas,NOT
thats awesome yay i am vegan too xxx go trish love yall,NOT

wow i love this channel i just found it today,NOT
the wage gap is not real,NOT
awesome freelee youre an inspiration ,NOT
so what youre saying is that women earn less because they have children which then restricts the hours they can work and reduces their relative levels of experience when compared with people who have worked full time for the most part the other gaps are likely due to the fact that men and women are different with men having more physical strength more body mass higher muscle body composition ratio being taller more likely to take risks slightly higher iqs family roles encouraging males to work harder to support the family while the woman is caring for the baby ect until you invent a way for children to be made without the need for a mother and for as long as youre not pumping little girls with relatively huge amounts of testosterone hgh and retraining them to not be risk adverse or perhaps giving little boys drugs to make them more compliant and drugs to stunt their growth reduce their testosterone drastically there will always be a wage gap,NOT
a website says this is probably propaganda  im a male nurse i make less generally than female nurses most of the time and get my ass pinched all the time,NOT
have you ever thought that maybe some women would rather take care of children,NOT

come on you want to get rid of schedules just so that wives can be worked to death easier why cant we just work to create an environment where women dont feel like they have to be a slave to their husbands theres no reason they should take the majority of the work raising children unless they want to that is but still i dont like the idea of saying oh you want to work two jobs give up on all your dreams slave away in the kitchen while your husband and children watch tv okay then lets help you make that possible,NOT
well now shes eating chicken and fries ,NOT
uber did a study on this too they found the exact same percentage gap existed but not because women were paid less if anything uber is renowned for its equalityfocused business model instead women were more willing to work more flexible hours stayed in the uber system for less time and werent as competitive as men with regard to where the best spots were the wage gap existed primarily due to experience behind the wheel in the uber system where men spent longer hours and were more driven pun intended to earn the most out of their position they deduced women had more obligations such as family than men and are more open to reviewing their choices by transferring from one job to the next men on the other hand are willing to find the most profitable position and stick with it regardless of how it goes it reveals the key psychological differences between men and women seem to reflect their earnings,NOT
yeah right bitch hahahaha you cant stay alive without burger king lmao,ABU

but then again girls are allowed into boys scour so idgaf,NOT
the on going debate continues on whether there is a pay gap between men and woman and there are many arguments on both sides with opposing views on this issue the way gap brings up the issue that women are payed less than men in the working field most statistics for this topic come from the census bureau which looks at full time workers according to gould schieder and geier they go into detail explaining the different ways in which other people analyze the wage gap from looking at specific occupations or by taking into consideration part time jobs and how this may lead people to think that data on the wage gap is unreliable however no matter how people approach how they measure the wage gap there is always a gap i feel that those that do not believe in the wage gap look at the specific occupations or varying forms of measuring the wage gap such as christina hoff sommars in the myth of the gender wage gap in every example she explained there was still a gap between men and women whether big or small a gap is still evident her argument claiming that it is the pursuit of happiness that steers women and men to different career paths is not completely true there is a restriction women have due to their roles in motherhood and according to equal means equal even in female dominated professions men still get paid more looking beyond professional careers and taking into consideration professional sports teams men get paid much more than women when it comes to sports consider soccer although the womens soccer team far excels in the sport over the mens team they still get paid much less than them,NOT
she probably wishes she lived in southern california like la or venice beach or santa barbara those are her type of places but im sure she cant afford it,NOT

narrator david attenborough ,NOT
if its not allowed in the sports national stage the olympics then nope not fair or allowed  unfair ,ABU
can we stop telling them what they are they chose to identify as this they should be accepted we should respect them as what they want to be if a friend was this video and said these would you act this way just respect them this can hurt people think with what little wits you have before you post something for i use theythem pronouns because i dont know what gender they are,NOT
buahahaha just hold your breath until she goes vegan good luckd she cant even eat healthy imagine going not vegetarian but vegan not even in a million years,NOT
it is illegal to pay a man and women differently its not an argument about earning potential but rather earning outcomes there is no argument here,NOT
they should compete against other trans gendered people its ridiculous competing against girls when they obviously have more testosterone which increases muscle mass,ABU
vox the reasonable arguement didnt get their facts from biased sites buzzfeed the crazy feminist that did no research got facts from biased websites not so reasonable,NOT
wow good on you girl,NOT
if you want to do this in a healthy way you cannot calorie restrict i would advise you to do research and go into this more as a lifestyle than a diet you have to eat a lot and a variety you also need to stay active which you already do ,NOT
in my demographic urban age  women make more than men anyone want to talk about that wage gap,NOT
i completely agree i only wish your editor could spell way gap,NOT
i didnt make any kids not my problem wierd graphs,NOT
k triggered women,NOT
i understand this completely if you dont understand dont shun her its not her fault if you cant rap your head around it,NOT
so glad i am a vegan since august  i love the plant base lifestyle,NOT
i think shes just trying to save her channel ,NOT
dont be scared of the calories i know its hard because society teaches us this calorierestrictive way of thinking and thats the only way to stay skinny i can see that youre in that mindset now i used to be in that mindset too but remember that its not true its not about how much calories you eat but which calories you eat my biggest tip for you always remember to get enough calories i cant stress this enough if you undereat youll end up feeling tired and just go back to animal products plant foods are lower in calories so youll have to eat more amounts to get enough calories also know that cravings is your bodys way of telling you it needs fuel so eat as much as you want and crave you can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet as long as its high carblow fat good luck trish xx,NOT
soooo the feminists we wrong saying that the wage gap was caused by the sexist patriarchy,NOT
sending this to my mum,NOT
trish will do anything for attention  shes such a troll at this point that she cant even cancel herself,NOT
nevermind the transgender people that may be offended by trishas video think about all the confusion the video is going to cause for people who may still be struggling with their identity or for those who are uneducated about what transgender really is,NOT
smoothiessmoothies and protein powderfruits and almonds milk and maple syrupgo girl,NOT
also fun fact the wage gap is a lie men often take more high paying jobs since we look more towards science and mecanica but women look more to serving and receptions just to call a few examples,NOT
you are false news,NOT
shes no longer vegan surprise,NOT
soy milk and coconut creamer are good dairyfree options for coffee trader joes has a lot of good frozen options if you want something easy and quick they also have lots of vegan snacks good luck,NOT
the wage gap is probably due to kids women typically work less hours to care for kids afterwards they may put more effort into the workplace,NOT
i would love to go vegan but im such a picky eater and dont like many foods and i dont know where i would even begin,NOT
what people miss it doesnt exist,NOT
no mames trisha,NOT
informative video and all that but listen to it yourself and pay attention to the sound at the end of your sentences once you hear it you cant not focus on it,NOT
no disrespect but i will not like to see my daughter getting out run by a boy who feels like a girl the body mass the bone structure are male is not fair they know that they should compete but with other transgenders not with real girls is my opinion and im sure  percent think the same way i do,ABU
trisha i like guys i must be a guy who is gay because woman can like men too right,NOT
oh and on the myth on wages of men and women i wonder maybe it because women are far more vain that men and find it easier to lie to get more money maybe just maybe its because women are far more greedy than men i dont see boys or men running off to go buy  dollar pair of pants from the buckle or boys telling a lie about how much prom coast so that their so called trusting girls can take back their prom dress that her and her mother picked out to get a more expensive one on top of a more tramp looking one on top of that or how they will threaten a manager that she will sue them for discrimination if he doesnt giver her a promotion or a pay raise hell ask jerry springer or the view they seem to be demoralizing americans pretty well im sure they could answer that question,ABU
i think its a troll i never take her seriously,NOT
they have unfair advantage simple,NOT
shes n idiot haha and you kids look too her she is a empty shell,ABU
holy crap  seconds into the video and shes already cited an incorrect fact using the median income for males and females assumes that men and women are equally represented in all areas of the workforce equally educated and equally experienced an easy way to show this is to compare the number of males in ceo positions as compared to women the stupid amount of money that ceos make is going to skew that statistic by a lot a different study that compared individuals in the same field with similar experience and education found that the income ratio was closer to   and the  discrepancy was made up for by men prioritizing pay over job satisfaction and men pushing for raises more aggressively i really wish people would do better research for videos pertaining to this topic the wage gap is essentially gone in most sectors of the job market,NOT
whats up with vegans what happened to vegeterians in my oppinion vegeterian is the first logical step,NOT
men need  kcalday women need kcalday men pay alemony men do heavier and more dangerous jobs women mostly work inside men use their salaries to buy shoes for work women buy fancy shoes men build the whole infrastructure of the country roads airport tunnels houses planes men get killed defending the country women bake cakes and spend  hour every day putting on their face women when you take on these tasks the you can ask for a raise therefore women earn more than men,ABU
hey please educate yourself first this might make serious harms to the trans community most of the things you said about being trans doesnt make sense,NOT
trish d please do like vegan day  vlog and what you ate and all that stuff,NOT
the reason men make more is because they work more hours in the same jobs the reason they work more is because theyre more ambitious on average the reason for this is because men are expected to earn money and pay for dates to court women women can always fall back on marrying rich so it stunts the ambition level of the average woman there isnt much that can be done about this as the root cause of these behaviors are biological lets just accept that there will be a pay gap but its closed when you consider the payingfordates gap and the fact that women control  of consumer spending even though men make about  of the income in the usa what does that last piece of data show yes that men make the majority of income but women spend it they spend mens money ask any marketing or advertiser which gender they sell to have you ever heard of a woman called a deadbeat in our culture no why is that within that answer also lies the answer to the wage gap bandeadbeat,NOT
lol they dont even realise theyre promoting the neocapitalist society when they support more flexible hours more flexible hours will only lead to more insecure work contracts creating more inequality,NOT
please provide sources to first prove it exists,NOT
do yall now see how close the girls who are born girl are to them some of yall just mad yall kids lost i feel like they should be allowed to race with them now if they werent winning the races yall wouldnt have said anything,ABU

so proud first off your carbs are so important  that should make like  percent of your diet carbs  healthy carbs  potatoessweet potatoes rice and beans also avoid oils minimal oils i mean  also you need veggies i recommend slipping spinach into fruit smoothies you dont even taste it  love you ,NOT

lets see in a years time if she has made any progress with transitioning,NOT
watch kalels videos shes been vegan for almost  years and she is very helpful with vegan foods and can help you get started your  week diet,NOT
to sum it up  video states that the wage gap isnt because of discrimination but because of what choices women have jobs worktime etc doesnt state that there is a pay gap i conclude that there isnt a discrimination of women but that the fault is in women as they can make more they just generally choose less paying jobs work less not everything is their fault as you can account that women have kids so that influences their earnings,NOT
whats wrong with her,NOT
i love vegan i dont get how we ever got to flesh eating glad to be conscious now though ,NOT
omg she just mad she lost first thing say in my brain trash she just a sore loser sorry but the truth nobody shouldve even let that lady start that,NOT
does anyone understand what shes talking about cause i sure dont ,NOT
this video actually states that the gender wage gap does exist it just says its ok it really annoys me when people dont understand that gender wage gap just means women on average get paid less than men not women who work at the same position as a man get paid less then men,NOT
id fuck da shit out dis bitch,ABU
common sense is not common,NOT
remaining oblivious to facts and reason regarding the wage gap propaganda in the us is far too lucrative for the neofeminist movement to abandon without the ghost of patriarchy to chase there are few gendered causes to rally around and individuals within the movement are left only with introspection which almost never yields the results anticipated our society does indeed have issues that require addressing but as long as neofeminists continue to taint each with the attitude that men are the sole cause for these problems many people from both genders will be reticent to become allies for these causes neofeminism  having equal opportunity yet demanding equality of outcome,NOT
edamame is so good you can get it frozen too so its easy any of amys brand frozen vegan foods are really good for transitioning potatoes of course basmati rice banana oatmeal ezekiel bread and there are tons of recipes on pinterest,NOT

this is an insult to the whole trans community shes mocking the meaning and struggle of being trans and obviously has no clue what shes talking about weather its a joke or not its still discusting that she thinks this is appropriate to post that isnt the only problem with the video shes heavily gender stereotyping and being sexist i am so sick and tired of her trolling and desperate cries for attention,NOT
such an attention seeker give me a break already smh,NOT

mourning my last two brain cells from her last video hahah follow my channel guys before i get famous so you will be og followers,NOT
i wish i was a vegan id be so thin just that i strongly believe that pesticides in plants are probably more deadly than the stuff they put in meat also most fruit and veggies are covered in gmo stuff and pesticides and i think thats gross i want to be supper skinny and i dont think a plant based diet will get me there plant based diet will probably get you cancer once you people understand what gmos are i dont hate vegans and im sure there are intelligent vegans that grow their own gmo free food tap water is also kinda gross with fluoride so maybe yall can use rain water for plants just saying that its so hard to avoid being poisoned these days and veganism is almost like a prop to make people believe they are eating healthy unpoisoned food,NOT
im sorry trish but you cant achieve freelees look in  weeks it took her years i feel like you should take this idea for longer than two weeks,NOT

trisha has been known for trolling yes but she also has been known for emotional unstability and numerous identity crisis i think she has always wanted desperately to feel like she belongs and that explains why she tries to insert herself in the lgbt community in absurd ways do i think shes trans hell no do i think she is legitimately struggling and needs to put some sort of label to it yes i think she believes shes trans and i think she believes that because she needs a concrete answer to a lifelasting issue,NOT
yes trish im so happy for you this is going to make you feel so good the best advice any vegan can give you is do a lot of research that way you will stick to a plant based diet xx,NOT
you should also check out high carb hannahs channel she has lost a lot of weight by going vegan  she also have great tasty recipes,NOT
come on guys be nice to trisha she is trying also it would be amazing to have someone with as many views and subs as her in the vegan community,NOT

sam smith has a bit more of an impact since they released songs before,NOT
theres already laws that make paying women less illegal and you can sue companies for doing so so why arent you taking them to court and why do you think another piece of paper reiterating a law already in place is going to do anything dumbass,NOT
girl rice beans and vegan cheese is so good and its packed with protein and iron i eat this a lot in my vegan diet also kale and hemp seeds are great for protein,NOT
here is a challenge for people who believe in the gender pay gap find me a man and a woman whos salaries differ when they both work in the same industry for the same company and perform the same role as well as work the same hours have the same experience qualifications and education while being the same age dont worry ill be waiting,NOT
are we just gonna forget about the time she came out as a chicken nugget anyone,NOT
the wage gap is shrinking as women are having kids at an older age because honestly looking after kids can be very full on  it can be hard work but women should be allowed to choose to have kids without getting fire from angry people,NOT
this is amazing im so excited,NOT
house tour  please thumbs up everyone wants to see her house,NOT

sjws have no economic concepts of anything all they know how to do is to burst into a loud rage based on nothing but emotion,NOT
pierce is such a drama queen he is putting on such a show he knows that tasted great,NOT
they are biological males sorry no sympathy here it is still not fair to women,ABU
the easiest way to think about debunking the wage gap is this way if women really are paid less why dont certain businesses just hire women so they can save more money in employee salary,NOT
well the calculations are indeed wrong but there is a wage gap this video just takes a wrong calculation and uses it to say yeah everything is fake but the real wage gap not that one which is commonly used by a lot of public media and politicians is determined by looking at men and women who acutally do the same thing in the same company at the same office and even if most of you dont want to accept it there is a difference it is absolutly true if a men and a women go to a job interview for exactly the same position and talking to exactly the same boss there is a high chance that they get different wage offers this ist statistically proven,NOT
well i cant speak for all women but for me  im a single mum and the only time ive been paid less is when i decided to be a stay at home mum other than that ive probably earned more than my male counterparts at times through out my career wage should reflect skills not gender and like most commentators have stated here its actually illegal well in western countries anyway,NOT
mancheeze the great made a video on ya you should respond to the terf,NOT

woooo trisha  im subbing,NOT
i agree that feminazis blow this stuff out or proportion and that the gender wage gap isnt what they say it is however this video is weak imo i want to love it i really do but the arguing here is a little weak  around  you say the small wage gap that does exist while having the title there is no gender wage gap  pick one  slide at  has the word may which completely destroys its value you can say anything may cause anything provided its not  false the slide is literally useless because of this  word,NOT
i have a masculine energy she says with her glitter acrylic nails diamant top hair extensions and lip filler ,NOT
you neglected to mention that men often work more overtime than women and that some of the higher paying jobs that men take pay more because they are more dangerous and more likely to kill the men,NOT
this is what brings up the sexism conversations,NOT
most men lack the orderliness and patience needed for child care so women are often relegated voluntarily or involuntarily for domestic work it is sad thing that male humans are evolutionary weak in parenting when some birds fish and amphibians show good male nestkeeping and parenting,NOT
im a registered nurse and a man i make more than almost all of my female rn coworkers why my bosses are women its because  i never call in sick  i constantly work as charge nurse extra pay  i work full time  i work overtime  im willing to work nights extra pay  i dont take a year off when i have kids its not rocket science,NOT

if being a woman thats a little bit masculine or a man thats a little bit feminine makes you trans then everyone is trans,NOT
what do you say to the real girls this makes me sick it is soo wrong,ABU
maybe the wage gap is larger in business fields because the hours tell to be more flexible so women are more likely to take more time off to care for their children and therefore may not be as productive or meet as many quotas as their male or childless counterparts,NOT
workout five days a week for an hour cross train and give up red meat drink nothing but water for liquids the pounds will just drop going vegan is too drastic for you small steps,NOT

i wonder whether its ever occurred to her that maybe the reasons why women choose to go into fields that pay less and to work fewer hours etc are because of the way our society is structured unequally which is still a relevant sexist issue in any case a wage gap narrowed to  is still wage gap and not negligible like she seems to think,NOT
if you know for a fact that you would most likely never have sex with them then why not be attracted to gayslesbians,NOT

i appreciated how this researched and went further into reasoning it definitely pinpoints the roots,NOT

if companies could pay less to hire women then why would they ever hire men or is it actually based on average time worked vs our social stigma of men have to work more to support their family or they are not a good husband or how each gender has tendencies to pick different jobs,NOT
a dude in a wig is not female let them compete with men or is that not pc,ABU

oh please world goverments internetional bodies like the un oecd world bank and imf and leading banks and financial institutions all confirm the wage gap is real economists who have spent their entire lives studying the way gap and know a hell alot more about it than a resident scholar of a rightwing think tank and edgy teens who have never worked a day in their life another ignorant video even the first argument why dont firms only hire women is a fallacy that totally ignores logistics demographics and skill levels not to mention the oecd found even factoring in work choices hours leave etc still leaves a nearly  wage gap and forget offthebooks gender discrimination opening your eyes to the obvious conservative agenda being forced here,NOT
can we just let t be who she wants to be and do what she wants to do people go through this on their own and in their daily lives trying to figure out who they are and what they want so can we just let t live her life cause shes honestly a queenkingprincessprince whatever the fuck she is comfortable with and wants to be thank you goodnight,NOT
womem tend to take jobs that allow them to be more flexible with there hours men rend to take jobs that make more but have a much stricter hour,NOT
for the same job women and men will earn the same men are just more likely to work overtime or take on extra tasks than women who are generally more concerned with taking care of children if the gap was so real why dont companies just hire all women if it costs less for the same work,NOT
god she looks bad,ABU
i think in order to fix the wage gap people need to forget what they know about the wage gap there are more factors that go into it than we initially think or see its complicated just like any other issue,NOT
nice and positive vidlike it,NOT
trish is being sooooooo ignorant this whole video is describing that trish is gender fluid not trans,NOT

 men were earning k and women were earning  less k now correct me if im wrong but isnt that  less,NOT

is there a gap in these fields i dont think these were studied bricklayers roofers aircraft mechanics plumbers road surface repair workers heavy equipment operators hazardous waste disposal technicians compressed gas delivery techs pallet jack operations tree trimmerclimbers firefighters chemical processors dockworkers drillers explosives handlers petro yardworkers pipefitters field laborers power generation containment cable riggers forklift operators for hazardous materials hvac service technicians fiber optic installers toolmakers lathe operators underground construction crewmembers coal miners loadersunloaders fuel station monitors utility maintenance techs welders window installers yard laborers elevated concrete laborers wastewater treatment operators machinists truckloaders iron workers bridge iron workers tunnel iron workers elevated construction ironworkers rebar  structural these are all fields that are overwhelmingly male and this is hardly a comprehensive list i get the distinct impression that nothing hazardous or dangerous ever comes up when discussing this fictional gap because in the west women have it so good they retain the luxury of not even having to think about jobs that can kill them in this issue im suspicious that is the case when the gap comes up hazardous jobs are never mentioned show less,NOT
lolthe lies that spread throughout the video,NOT
 dear blaire surely you know her brand is contradicting  trolling content ffs it cracks me up people literally fall for it like catch on guys have u forgotten when she identified as a chicken nugget or as a lesbian,NOT

veganismthe suicide culthundreds of videos on youtube by ex vegans who nearly died on this starvation chemical filled dietbewaresponsors of this movie own hundreds of vegan restaurants and are cashing in on billions of dollars while they enjoy meat and dairy and while you take a trip down suicide alley to end up very ill or mentally compromised for the first months or years its cool as you stop eating junk food which you should have never eaten anyway but after the detox is endedthen the problems will start and the community of desperate vegans will bear down on you to make sure you go down that sad road to hell with them you will become abusive too of every and any one who does not subscribe to your way of misguided eating habits you will be obsessed with food you will eventually end up afraid of everything you touch as foodwhat is in it what does the packaging say and packages will promise you the moon but very rarely deliver you real food besides you give the cells in your body the tedious work of converting a bean or lentil into human fleshand these cells will eventually revolt leaving you with cancer and other incurable illness i know as a friend ended up with bone cancer within a year of turning veganbeware of this suicide cult making money while they lead you to your grave and you end up with very little joy of living and can go nowhere on the planet unless you visit this groups special vegan restaurant which eats up all your cash so you dont even have money for rent,ABU
you know veganism is taking off when even burger king is offering plant based options,NOT
the best psa,NOT
she is absolutely  correct,NOT
trisha you are gonna need so much more food than that im so happy you are going vegan thats amazing just one more person helping the environment and the animals so i have been vegan for  years now and i want you to know that you will thrive off of a vegan diet the fruits you have are great watermelon and grapes are my fav too but buy some black beans and whitebrown rice for a great protein source also tofu is a great source of protein but if you arent a fan of that try the gardein fake meats they are absolutely delicious and have tons of protein but unfortunately they are a bit processed but i recommend getting their orange fake chicken and having that with some rice and stirfry i promise you it is mouthwatering good also ben and jerrys has vegan icecream yes you can still have many processed foods as a vegan but since you are looking to be a bit healthier get some oats to make oatmeal and coconut sugar with some raisins and bananas is so good,NOT
banana the freelee girl is so happy right now,NOT
ive been waiting for this i knew it was gonna come lmao,NOT

shes not trans unless you consider fucking moron as a gender,ABU
this is the kind of mukbang i want to see lol healthy and vegan,NOT
vegetarian  years  vegan  years ,NOT
i think the only right way to look at the gender wage gap is to look if men and femals get the same wage for the same job with the same hours all other calculations follow a prefixed idia,NOT
 you do not choose a gender identity or sexual orientation,NOT
im glad that was clarified,NOT
times are not that rough hunny that killed me  dudes out here living off an only fans ,NOT
vegans are so damn irritating,NOT
hey freelee can you make a video for people interested in becoming vegan on a college diet i am vegetarian for almost  years now and as i am getting older im starting to become much more aware of my body and how certain products react to my body especially dairy  also im wondering if you ever have kids how will you raise them with food because im thinking about becoming vegan im also thinking about my future and my kids and i told my boyfriend i would want our children to become vegan if im vegan do you agree with that do you think thats ok do  or do you think thats not healthy for young children i would love to hear your views and what your opinions are on this topic,NOT
this is like a man taking alot of steroids,NOT
given the information presented here sounds to me like the only true way to close the gap in the workplace is to close the gap at home,NOT
so many angry woman screaming at their screens right now,NOT
men have a pee pee women have a vagina next way more important thing then this fake news,NOT
so she wants to be a guy because she thinks itll be easier to have a penis okay good reasoning,NOT
never heard of you but vegan gains did a vid on you so i wish you luck ,NOT
hey you guys this is fake news,NOT
i dont know why trisha is still getting attention shes doing stuff like this constantly and i have  respect for her behavior since all she does is troll and lie,NOT
thanks for posting the truth i know its not politically correct to expose these type of cnn liars who want to spread propaganda for their own divide and conquer political gain,NOT
so obviously someones gender identity is not something i can decide for them so i generally give people the benefit of the doubt now if they had said something along the lines of im a demiperson and not i like feminine guys lolz obviously im a gay man it would have maybe made sense as it is im losing more and more brain cells by the second watching this,NOT
trisha i know you probably wont see my comment but google all of the vegan places near you youll be able to post mate yourself vegan food dont be afraid of over eating because everything youll be consuming now is healthier calories,NOT
the wage gap is bullshit,NOT
yay hopefully this all goes well ,NOT
you forgot other important factors like work extra hours sickdays vacations different life choices ambitions etc,NOT
great job freelee your persistance payed off,NOT
you like gay guys you fantasize about girls im confused,NOT
wow i was really enjoying your channel too bad you ruined it bye,NOT
i know youre not talking about me but i still feel like im being dragged,NOT
omg i was waiting for this video,NOT
i get shes just shitposting but like sis needs mental help,NOT
bravo a brilliant documentary filmi just wish i could get my family to sit down and watch this thank you pbn ,NOT

this is the first prager u video i agreed with,NOT
everyone in the comments who is blindly saying that the wage gap is a lie is a moron it exists it is just far smaller than the  ratio that is usually shown and is closer to  this amount albeit much smaller has been entirely credited to workplace sexism by experts,NOT
only vegan can save animals en planet go vegan  vegan is future ,NOT
if the uswn soccer team were men they would make millions i am a  yr old boy and enjoy watching them more than the men because of their pure undramatized and relevant talent and philanthropy,NOT
i must say that this video which tries to explain the differences is really quite ignorant yes the differences can be explained by choices but it is not like as a woman you are by nature more likely to go for less paying jobs it is that they are held back by structures in society men are not better rocket scientists and women arent better suited for being nurses these patterns can be explained it is what the genders stereotypically do that decides google engineer or doctor and then google nurse or kindergarten teacher overrepresentation in better and lower paying jobs has directly to do with the societies view and for these people to flat pit ignore that makes me pissed ,NOT
more of your vids should be like this,NOT
they are biological men  they are physically male yall want fucking equality you can have it  women fought for our rights and equal representation and here we are handing it back over to men again  we get to watch on the side lines again ,ABU
another person jumping on the trend train and dismissing people with true gender dysphoria,NOT
it will make women step up their game i dont see anything wrong lol,NOT
they were born male even though they feel their female they are boys and should be competing against boys they have an unfair advantage competing against natural born women,ABU
hey trisha im really happy for you ive been vegan for  months and its the best decision ive ever made i was able to find a lot of amazing videos on youtube for recipes some of the best ones are the vegan what i eat in a day videos the vegan corner cam and nina naturally stephanie and many more are great youtube channels that share many recipes also if you like ice cream frozen bananas with a little bit of nondairy milk makes the best soft serve ice cream that is delicious and completely healthy and cruelty free you can blend it with chocolate or peanut butter and put on loads of toppings the wonderful thing is you can eat as much as you want of it as well good luck in these two weeks and i hope you enjoy and possibly continue with the vegan diet,NOT
this argument does not make any sense you are comparing wages from a variety of fields instead of one corporation how about you focus on individual firms and see how much of a myth the wage gap is,NOT
excuse me logic doesnt work on feminists you simply need to screech louder than they do,ABU
eating hot wings while watching this  i just feel the need to let everyone know that i meat,NOT
though as a member of the lgbt i was very offended by this video i think its truly immoral to be so negative towards trish i hope to god that she isnt trolling we are all aware of the strength it takes to come out as trans so if this is who trish really is then instead of shaming we should be taking this opportunity to educate and explain why what was said in this video is erroneous i would also recommend finding a new gender therapist if the concept of dysphoria hasnt come up in conversation or the fact that drag queen or gay isnt on the gender spectrum then perhaps that is contributing to the confusion good luck on your journey trish,NOT
ok we get it mentally girls dude still biologically boys come on man,ABU
blaire you look amazin,NOT
hey i have a diagnosis for you pathological liar,ABU
the reason why they said there is a pay gap is because they combined the jobs so maybe more men have better jobs however that can lead to a controversial topic about employment discrimination,NOT
an awesome vegan channel is thevegancorner they are all really amazing recipes theyre soo good they have all the food i never thought id be able to eat as a vegan,NOT
i just started vegan a month ago and its great im skinnier im stronger im healthier and i am doing so much better without meat we really need to stop eating meat would you eat a dog or cat no so why eat pigs cows chickens lambs and goats they are just as smart as us they arent just a dumb animal would you eat your family ofcourse not so why does that give you a right to eat meat it doesnt so i think all people who are vegan are just amazing people and they should keep eating plant based food i have so much more energy now and i feel so much healthier go vegan people stop eating meat,NOT
next time i run into a feminist im showing them this video,NOT
ahh i got chills,NOT

i am straight but i think youre cute dose that make me gay,NOT
ummmm are there any live brain cells in her empty head love the cat by the way looks like our shelly aka the ginger menace ,NOT
i just want to say to people commenting about how she has already failed it literally isnt going to happen overnight rome wasnt built in one day and trisha isnt going to become full vegan immediately like she said it takes baby steps and if she makes some mistakes or has weak moments along the way thats totally okay she is human and she is trying and that is what matters i really hope she sticks to this and that it makes a positive impact on her life be supportive  helpful instead of putting her down xx,NOT
they want to compete with girl with no male gentiles then they can cut theirs off cut off the extra testosterone so to speak if you have a dick and balls then you are a male the one shows sign of getting a mustache pathetic that these twisted individuals force their sickness on others,ABU
men on average earn more than women especially mothers stop shaming women professionals and saying they are less driven its societys construct that prevents mothers from free daycare maternity leave and a reasonable schedule is demanded by both mean and women,NOT
oh boy here comes the right,NOT
i just realized how far apart trishas eyes are,NOT
at some point girls competing in these events will do a boycott or walk off hats off to them in advance,NOT

why arent trans men breaking any records or at a minimum being competitive,NOT
if most woman do work which is supposed to be less paying and the gap is only  cents and there are way less full day working woman than men woman are actually earning way more than men ever can men to fight for fair pay,NOT
i find it funny that they use a female to talk,NOT
there dudes do they use the womans bathroom theres only  genders,ABU
ahhh trishy this is so exciting okay my favorite goto is beans  rice beans have a good amount of protein and the rice helps keep you full pasta is also really good and since you apparently like carrots based off this video you could do some thinly sliced carrots in the pasta and it would be so good and if you like avocados they have some protein too they also have some fats that are good for your body and they can be spread on toast and have a relatively similar texture to butter protein shakes are another good option and i frequently have those for breakfast and if any of your bananas get really soft and overripe peel them cut them up and put them in the freezer so you can blend them up to make banana ice cream as a sweet treat good luck with these  weeks and im sure theyll open your eyes to everything you can still eat as a vegan i promise you wont be missing out on anything  its such an awesome lifestyle,NOT
unfair males are physically stronger then most females because they have testosterone  some of yall saying yall are not transphobic etc we understand youre just giving your opinion as long as its not disgusting or prejudice youre good,NOT

to the negative vegans in the comment section youre the reason alot of people refuse to go vegan stop assuming stop judging and stop picking at every little thing just shut up and be positive about people being open to veganism the moment you judge little things is the moment we lose people away from veganism be helpful nice positive and encouraging and youll have more wanting to follow like the saying you attract more bees with honey so bee that honey ,NOT

i dont think trisha is ok,NOT
i love my body im so confident moves hair to show boob implants,NOT
these comments are exactly why the wage gap wont be going anywhere anytime soon we present you with a clear break down of facts and statistics and explain both the causes for these statistics and the implications and all we get in return is lying feminazis well you can lead an idiot to knowledge but you cant make them learn i guess,NOT
i absolutely love this,NOT
i see a new shane dawson series coming,NOT
why is it not called sex gap,NOT
theyre dudes no shit theyre gonna blow away their female competition ridiculous bullshit,ABU
please do not just eat a ridiculous amount go calories a day even if it is from vegan food eat enough and dont starve yourself you dont have to be scared of carbs but dont eat  bananas like freelee because thats insane do not believe any of that pseudoscience bullshit,NOT
its amazing to see so many people who feel that the best thing they ever done is going vegan i feel exactly the same i love to go to the shop as see my favorite vegan products sold out d,NOT
anyone else just hate her lips but cant stop looking at them,NOT
trisha so excited to see you try something like this a vegan subscriber here my advice would be to love yourself  know youre an wonderful person whether vegan or not if you wanna try this way of life just try eating different things and see what feels best for your body have fun with it fruits and fresh things are amazing i eat a lot of ricepasta with different sauces as well hope you have fun exploring the vegan world sending you much love ,NOT
years ago i told my female friend that our job is hiring her pay would be about double of what she was earning at the time little over minimum wage her eyes lit up big company all the benefits about half workers are female nothing she couldnt manage she was all for it until i told her its a night shift she flat out told me oh i cant work that from that point on i stop feeling sorry for her crying on fb how she is broke,NOT
you mentioned freelee and i immediately hit the thumbs down and quit watching she might be healthy but she has no right to be a bully to people who are not vegan felisha bye,NOT
chickfila ahieuaheiuaheiaehuaehaue lol iamdeceased,NOT
absolute bullshit make tuese boys run with the boys they were born with,ABU
trish i thought you knew better,NOT
good for you trish sending lots of love and hoping your vegan journey continues after these  weeks also i make these vegan burrito type things and i just chop up potatoes and saut them with onions and put in on a tortilla with guac salsa lettuce etc and its delish and very filling good luck,NOT
i totally see youre point and trisha is the biggest trolls so i dont really believe anything that comes out of her mouth however although my opinion may be irrelevant considering im cis i believe you dont necessarily have to transition to identify as something other than your assigned gender,NOT
what they miss about it is its nonexistence,NOT
life is easier than they make it if you wouldnt kill your dog or its puppies to eat them  then why would you eat an egg a chicken a cow  smh contradictions  veganislife  years vegan and feeling amazing not deficient in a thing ,NOT
the video prior is her unboxing a leather purse  its awesome that shes trying veganism good for her hopefully she inspires more people to go vegan,NOT
im so happy,NOT
let see how long she keeps it up,NOT
is scrolling through recommendations scrolls by wait what shrug w ai t wh a t,NOT
im brain dead now,NOT
thanks for this didnt wanna give trish my view in case it was bs really hope she sticks at this it could change her forever ,NOT
this makes so much sense feminists must have really low iqs to not know this or theyre just ignorant,NOT
im not telling you cant be vegan you do you so y u gotta judge everyone else,NOT
the fact that this kind of total absurdity could even spark any debate and mainstream news agency reports there are compelling arguments from both sides show that western countries r getting totally dumbfucked after legalizing gay marriage,ABU
try eat things like rice or homemade fries sweet potato fries or roast sweet potato and vegetables try include legumes like chickpeas or make some houmous if you dont like plain chickpeas and make soups and stuff for the week so that its easier not to resort to snacking,NOT
maybe next shell come out as eric cartman,NOT
i have never been sooo confused in my entire life ,NOT
loved it and a shoutout to all of those who shared additional sights ,NOT
the reason women often bear the responsibility of raising children is because they are better at it also why is it that nowadays stay at home moms are looked down upon its a hard job no doubt but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the traditional family structure where the man works and the woman takes care the kids for goodness sakes people it works better that way in most cases,NOT
im so happy veganism is blowing up because it will soon reveal just how unhealthy it truly is with all the ex vegans coming forward only those with low iq and zero research skills believe the vegan propaganda docos like game changers veganism has a super high drop out rate you will look forward to losing your period brain fog insomnia constant hunger irritability bloating weight gain acne muscle loss depression anxiety nose bleeds losing teeth etc yes its very healthy and naturalnot,NOT
it has to do with life choice its not les per hr its less per year ie less work put in per year,NOT
are you joking omg girl yes i subbed,NOT
i think shes just reaching for content,NOT
i dont wear makeup or do my hair most of the time but im pretty sure im not a dude,NOT
we do not claim her,NOT
get some starches in ,NOT
i find blair to be attractive but im not gay not into transgender blair is physically attractive has a brilliant personality and also beautiful effeminate ways whilst being morally sound,NOT
 feminist died in this video,NOT
i saw this as a ad and it was so great i watched the full  min ad,NOT
yeah i dont get it  is not   im not a feminist im just looking for a good aregument against the claims of a wage gap but apparently its an actuall thing,NOT
people seem to miss its not real,NOT
wish this had more dislikes,NOT
trisha just did a mukbang with chicken sooo,NOT
i thought men and women are the same aha,NOT
if you keep eating unlimited calories youll gain weight until your body heals and i think itd take a lot of time since you have messed up your metabolism so youre probably gonna gain weight instead of losing it the weight loss in this diet lasts some time its not done after a week,NOT
you can get protein from many things like nuts soy and potatoes with skin i have been vegan for a couple years now and pasta is really filling and avocado sticks to your ribs so you will feel full for longer make sure to buy vegan bread because some bread contains egg you can also get frapps with soy milk and no whip cream instead of milk i hope you read my comment and take some notes on it,NOT
the video states that the wage gap shrinks to  cents once you factor out the different choices men and women make but she then proceeds to claim that the remaining gap of  cents is caused by the choices that had just been factored out of the calculations,NOT
trisha youre a dumb bitch for this,ABU
the way you talk about ppl being fully transition down there and still having female energy is beyond disrespectful fuck i dont think you mean any disrespect by the video but jesus youre confused talk about this with a therapist work kit your views before posting this much rambling to ur very large platform,NOT
k triggered feminists who still want to play the victim disliked this video vox great job,NOT
im so proud of you trisha,NOT
is this real life or are we in some aliens super computer donald trumps president and women can be meni cant wait to se whats next haha,ABU
vox is speaking the truth respect,NOT
im attracted to gay guys so i must be a gay guy it doesnt quite work like that sweetie,NOT
if i feel like a amputee and want to cut off my leg  a doctor would not perform the operation it would be insane but if i feel like a girl i can get my genitalia cut off this is ridiculous we should not make a civil rights issue about feelings,ABU
didnt trasha say that dogs dont have brains  but shes a bisexual trans cisgender gay man now so i believe them,ABU
wait you have an ugly face lol no youre too beautiful babe,NOT
thats it  am going vegan ,NOT
shes just confused like when someone is contemplating if they are transgender,NOT
omg okay so if your craving ice cream literally just chop up a banana put it in a sealable bag and put it in the freezer wait over night then get a nutritionist bullet or something and put the frozen banana pieces in it with some frozen raspberries its very important to remeber nit ti add any liquids it may sound like it needs some water or something but trust me anyways just jeeo blending it and stirring it until it becomes an ice cream consistency and ong its amazing on pancakes,NOT
easy dont have babies,NOT
then theres the question on why womeon get the not as high paying jobs,NOT
this is the most attention seeking thing ive seen all day,NOT
also nursing is a good career path and is like  women i could have made k a year working nights in a psych unit at my first job but i chose a job on day shift paying k a year i now make k but would have been making k if i kept the night job,NOT
freelee ive watched u for awile im  i want to go vegan and ive tried but my parents arnt support of so when i tried to go vegan i was almost starving what should i do,NOT
i hate that your videos are so short ,NOT

omg i have never seen or heard of any of that animal cruelty that you shown up in the top corner when trish was talking about those videos how is that even legal my mouth just dropped,NOT
some people will do anything for coin  ,NOT
yes  means that theyre earning  less you cant even read off of a script you silly cat,NOT
guess what i had a short haircut i dress in unisex or more masculine clothes most of the time and i have mostly guy friends its called being a tomboy you said you  identify with your birth gender so do i you described what being a tomboy is like thats not what trans is,NOT
more dislikes then likes,NOT
im huge fan of you people congrats on this great film always watch the vegan xx only thing that impacted me negatively was the lack of information of the amazon forest situation probably the most important environmental situation in  bolsonaro is hands down the worst politician that could exist homophobic racists but the fires in amazon forest was due to several factors that not only envolve cattle or soy also brazil  wise is way more responsible that many of european countries about that matter and i never hear anything about them since im already here talking i would love a documentary about sub develop countries in brazil we dont have all that plant based products i cook so for me its ok but we have a lot of problems most important poverty sorry about that but i would like to make a few discussion points,NOT
i have a small construction company and i know for a fact that i will get more productivity and therefore more profit out of male workers if the women could get the same amount of work done for less i would have no problem having a company full of them but in reality if i did that my company would probably go bankrupt and id have wild sexual harassment claims against me for telling them to work harder,NOT
i truly hope you are seeing a psychologist so you can get your self sorted out there is nothing wrong with getting help,NOT
its way unfair fuck you talking about,ABU
so theres no wage gap just an earnings gap employers arent sexist maybe people will finally listen,NOT
why are they wearing sports bras,NOT
vegan old indian word for poor hunter,NOT
still love u tho,NOT
girl im starting my vegan diet tomorrow and i tried it for  weeks and i felt so amazing,NOT
thank you for this videos my friends,NOT
bruh let her be who she wants to be shes trans she wants to be that let her yall stupid youtubers only bring up drama and shit you couldve texted her telling her ur own self the shit u wanna say but instead u do it on a vid just for clout im about done with life bye,NOT
tofurkey makes some great vegan products including vegan hot dogs and a vegan pizza which is so good i always tell new vegans to eat exactly what they used to eat just the vegan version also ben and jerrys makes a vegan ice cream that tastes just like the real thing and gardein makes really good vegan chicken tenders vegan meatballs vegan crabcakes my personal favorite etc hope this helps and good luck,NOT
ill believe it when i see it none of that will fill you you need to eat balanced everything is good in balance is good its all about balance educate yourself more on this subject,NOT
jesus thats meth head what the fuck if that thing,ABU
the wage gap is caused by women themselves due to their career lifestyle financial choices etc it has nothing to do with employers or the patriarchy if women were paid less than men then why wouldnt employers only hire women,NOT
well done add some beans lentils nuts for extra protein,NOT
trisha paytas trolls a lot keep in mind this is the girl who made do dogs have brains and is being gay a choice,NOT
you should try some of the gardein products theyre frozen meat substitutes full of protein also any beans or nuts or granola with protein is good i like to make protein shakes every morning with berries almond milk some ice and tofu and it tastes so good and youll find so many recipes online for different ways to use tofu and make it taste so good good luck trish love ya,NOT
this is going to happen more boys that suck against other boys will throw on a wig and say they are girls so they can beat them they need to create a trans league the sad part is parents will see this as a way to make money off their kids,NOT
dont be afraid of carbs potatoes rice pasta dont forget the veggies dark colors are the best dark greens and oranges like broccoli carrots collard greens gardein makes the best veggie meats count your calories boo,NOT
i worked in a predominantly male industry for over  years and made more money than most of the men and women in our group the reason why is because i was single and had no family commitments i was willing to work the long hours and do standby everyone else had family commitments they needed to pickup kids at daycare or go to a school event the women were always taking time off because their kids were sick and thus not dependable i found the women were always complaining about how they didnt get paid enough but were never able to admit that it was because they were unable to put in the extra work to get the raises they always wanted to blame it on sexism,NOT
finally a video where youre actually being nice to someone,NOT
this chanel is a complete fake news full of democrats and proabortion people you should be ashamed by the type of america you are defending you left people want to turn the us into a socialist country dont you see what socialism has made it destroyed countries make america great again,NOT
youre a fucking idiot this is incredibly offensive to transgender people delete this you literal dumpster fire,ABU
what if freelee reacted to this freelee react to this,NOT
girl normally i can defend you a little bit but it was wrong for you to title this video i am transgender female to male and then claim to identify as a bisexual woman some days and a gay man the other you couldve titled this i am gender fluid instead of making such a bold statement that you dont even stand by   you support the lgbt community and provide reasons to not take transgender people seriously  i cant,NOT
ive been waiting for this video the second i saw trishas video im like hun that doesnt make you trans i hope blaire does a response video rofl,NOT
i dont like to be the center of attention unless im the center of attention  hmmmmm,NOT
surprisingly unbiased video informative and factual good job vox,NOT
people see a set of data notice an inequality and immediately scream sexism what they miss is that the wages are exactly the same between genders but men usually work longer hours than women,NOT
not wanting ur period not liking the societal pressures sexualization  abuse u get from being female and wanting to fuck people does not mean ur trans  a trans male,NOT
you are maybe the most unintelligent person i know of,ABU
how much did freelee pay you ,NOT
you know its a myth when its a woman tackling the topic,NOT
so glad u are trying it drinking huge smoothies in the morning really help my skin and weight put almond milk instead of yogurt try adding cinnamon and vanilla if u crave something meaty target and stater bros has the gardein brand try the mandarin orange chicken also ralphs albertsons and trader joes has a huge selection of vegan stuff and whole foods and sprouts and are famous for being vegan friendly,NOT
shes eating chicken and wafles on her snapchat,NOT
vega products are great too i add the plant based protein powder to my smoothies,NOT
great response blaire,NOT
there was a butter ad before this,NOT
waiting for freelee to make a video now,NOT
i thought she was with the wage gap at the start who else,NOT
nice femenist video on something that does not exist,NOT
hey i made a video about what its like to be vegan at christmas can you guys check it out and tell me what you think its like a parody type of video ,NOT
the fact that this person is trying to explain why they identify as a man is what makes me think they might actually be confusing the fact that they like things that are not stereotypically liked by women with identifying as a man if you are trans it is because you are born that way and it does not have anything to do with your likings manners etc,NOT
i am just realizing how gay i am for blaire xd,NOT
get off the fucking bandwagon,NOT
fossil fuels are an issue but not anywhere near the effect of overpopulation and eating animal products  heres the difference  eating vegan will change things immediately  we can do it overnight  fossil fuels and the infrastructure will take decades to change,NOT
lowkey sad blaire eats chickfila,NOT
this is getting out of hand if your born with a dick and decided to be a women youre still a fucking man ,ABU
finnaly a women that is not a feminist,NOT
shes not vegan anymore on her last snapchat she was eating sour cream and onion chips ,NOT
if she was vegan then why did she put up a video of her eating chicken,NOT
well this lasted a very short while,NOT
again im not shocked shes always controversial,NOT
as we are talking about common sense lets really use it about occupations and choices i have little to say of course it is about choice about a choice that is influenced by more than one varible by education which women had no opportunity to receive years ago and which in underdeveloped countries still dont receive and by society and stereotypes but acknowledging what you say and leaving this issue aside let me use common sense to answer the question you stated at the beggining why wont bussinesses hire all women simple answer what we call in spain el techo de cristal women just for the condition of being women are underrated just because of the fact that they may have a baby are under appreciated to the point where businesses wont hire them because they will have to leave due to their maternity and i am talking worldwide so please lets stop being a society that can see but is not looking lets stop ignoring the undeniable reality because women are still being considered as the weak gender and workplace is just a manifestation of it ohh and if you want to talk about facts just ask me,NOT
it is not unfair it is just a coincidence they finished in the top,NOT
love this ive been vegan for  years,NOT
when i heard about this drama i said this in my headblaires making a new video,NOT
there is no wage gap it is literally illegal to pay women less women make  cents for every dollar a man makes because there are less women working and less women working highpaying jobs statistically women are shown to be less likely to ask for raises than men women have equal rights there is no patriarchy holding you back  of people in america at least believe in equality for everyone go watch a video on the wage gap besides this one its been thoroughly debunked several times feminism is cancer,NOT
check out unnatural vegan on yt for good advice on protein,NOT
when my mom was working as a bank teller in collage there was also a male collage student working there who was the same age they did the exact same job worked the same hours and worked under the same manager but he made almost  more than she did could someone explain this,NOT
this is the same woman that came out as a telletubbie sooo she can miss me with this one,NOT
just so you know you might gain weightsee no difference in the beginning after a couple of months you will see so much progress,NOT
because if they hired only women it would be unlawful discrimination you are coming out the box all kinds of wrong for thinking all of us are that unlearned not to recognize that error first and foremost since you are coming out the box like that it negates the rest of video thumbs down,NOT
further proof that youre a complete legend freelee another high profile person affected by your videos who is then willing to make the change go girl  youre amazing for far more than just your aesthetics,NOT
could you please start placing some of the major sourcesstudies in the description transcript for more convenient access,NOT
yes yessssssssssssss yesss,NOT
theres no such thing as transgender,ABU
oh this is so great much love,NOT
fucken disgusting totally pathetic,ABU
it does change even im my country still most of people and restaurants are ignorants but there are more and more options at convenient stores supermarkets and some restaurants im eager to see how this change will gain momentum and break current cruelty and stupidity based status go vegans,NOT
you dont go vegan for aesthetics you go vegan for the animals,NOT
thats amazing ,NOT
great to see this awesome data assumes everyone does exactly the same job in the business science and tech sectors,NOT
didnt she just make a video of her cooking and eating bacon and eggs,NOT
i still dont get why trolling is an excuse shes coming off incredibly shitty being shitty whether shes crazy or trying to be funny its shitty either way shes gone full logan paul gay for a month like this is her equivalent lmaoooo,NOT
thats great  im a vegan too technically a junk food vegan i lost so much weight,NOT
great video thanks for sharing should be compulsory to watch in all schools across the world,NOT
you guys didnt mention that women take more time of and more vacations,NOT
what is also funny is that paying women less is illegal so it wouldnt even be possible like some feminists suggest,NOT
you should start as a vegetarian then work your way up to being a vegan,NOT
ok so i wield and build things a forge  i also paint my nails and do my make up soo whats that make me ,NOT
why are you blacks so gay,ABU
i think its an issue that traditionally feminized and femaledominated fields like counselling nursing teaching are paid less than maledominated fields like engineering and tech why do we pay teachers and counselors less when those feilds are just as if not more essential to society as stem jobs,NOT
women earn less but they choose to emeurhasflskafd yeah ive heard this argument before doesnt really matter though im not going to complain that women are choosing to earn less than what they could have,NOT
u can be female and still be a tomboy that doesnt make you a man,NOT
so you telling me that if get boobs i can become the starting center for my schools female basketball team and more than likely got to the wnba and get  say less,ABU
women in an art major are destined for a life of welfare and disappointments,ABU
i had like  idiots at my school arguing about the wage gap with me and trying to make points and watching other idiots comment on this that have never researched anything in their lives really hurt my head,NOT
the problem isnt that women are paid less its that women are societally expected to start families and take care of their children the solution is paternity leave and having children after your career is stable,NOT
vox stop putting psychological warfare you suck,ABU
this says that men are always faster,ABU
eat lots of pastaaaaaa,NOT
blaire if i was  years younger do you think we could be friends you are so smart and you have so much common sense anyway i totally adore you and wish you nothing but all of the happiness in the world you really opened up my once sealed tight eyes on the transgender community thank you again,NOT
the wage gap isnt real there hasnt ever been a study that proves its real that takes into account education years worked experience hours worked maternity leave and ot the only study that was conducted showed that women fresh out of college made more than men who were fresh out of college,NOT
im probably going to get lots of hate for this but i relate a lot to this video i am very feminine to most people but i relate a lot to males i feel very masculine in some ways and very feminine in others some days i want to be a male and i feel so lost other days i want to be hyper feminine its very confusing to others and also myself and its so hard,NOT
harsh comments lol they are dudes genetics are genetics and they are men running against little girls so unfair,ABU
i need kalvin garrahs opinionthoughts and insights on this lol,NOT
okay to send the whole video she is transgender or portrays herself identifies to be transgender but she has this connection with gay people so she is a gay transgender now which there is nothing wrong with that let trisha do whatever she wants because she is her own person or he or whenever she he identify as and if you like whatever gendergenders that would be pansexual,NOT
omg im so shocked o im so happy,NOT
yes i want some sexism im very horny and naughty now you bad bad girls,NOT
animals have been going extinct since the beginning of time as well as new breeds evolve all the time this is the natural way of life on this planet ,NOT
well done  you guys did great,NOT
why dont they have their own trans track,NOT
of course the administration is going to let them in and the coaches have no problems with it they want to seem inclusive and want to win they dont care if they have to cheat to get it either,NOT
i dont understand how people dont see that shes mentally unstable and has been for years ,NOT
 yeah because of the money hypocrite,NOT
you can get protein from beans eggs and nuts if you want to get more carbs to help id suggest brown rice and corn maybe making a stir fry with no meat in it spaghetti squash and pasta salads also fruit smoothies in the mornings with protein powder in them,NOT
i feel like you are the most sensible trans and i love your view on things  non binary is such a joke ,NOT
clickbater thats what she is,NOT
this is bordering on real journalism,NOT
in my opinion my body is good enough that im somewhat comfortable with it the only reason i would consider going vegan would be to improve my skin clarity cuz girl i need some help with that,NOT
this bitch going vegan and has probably about  realleather handbags ,ABU
yes i love that thatbitch shirt,NOT
ive been a vegan for  years but could not watch this video because of the obnoxious background noisy drumsmusic,NOT
get some lenny and larrys cookies they are vegan cookies and they taste just like regular cookies you can buy them online or at walmart in the pharmacy department and the vitamin shop,NOT
hey trisha i happen to be a vegan my diet in the morning is a nature valley granola bar a bowl of almond milk with total cereal and a pair hth,NOT
i love how happy freelee looks shows that she really cares,NOT
just a heads up  not worth watching,NOT
in the old king james bible the word meat actually just means food i guess its a bit like british people calling dinner or supper tea,NOT
you dont need to like me you just need to hear me the truth ladies and gentleman,NOT
can someone get her the mental health hotline stat,NOT
someone pls send this to cathy newman urgently,NOT
i like this woman we need more of them,NOT
men consist of over  of workplace deaths,NOT
you wouldnt be you wouldnt be upset about being called a guy if you are a omfg,NOT

i stopped eating meat almost  months ago i have changed so much the smell of meat grosses me out and i used to love meat and i feel so healthy and better and freelee is the one who helped me,NOT
lets get some more support for nonbinary people ,NOT
but theyll never listen to these facts this gender wage gap has been debunked so many times that it has become a joke whenever they use it,NOT
these disgusting politicians need to be held accountable for crimes against humanity and nature,NOT
i never wear makeup i just walk around in sweatpants with mz hair in a bun when i go for a night out i put on full on glam does this make me a transgender person i feel like trysha is hurt and she just dont know the right way how to get attention,NOT
you make the decision on this one but id recommend closing the comments on this vid as they tend to be a septic tank on topics like this,NOT
sexism no longer exists on a legal or societal scale in the united states anymore why dont you new age feminists who claim to care sooo much about women protest and draw attention to the plight of women being forced into polygamous marriages in the middle east every minute why dont you campaign for the children being sold as sex slaves or the women in saudi arabia who cannot legally drive a car or even open a bank account without a male relatives permission draw attention to actual problems women are facing in the world instead of making up problems that dont exist so you can pull the victim card the patriarchy doesnt exist its a boogeyman feminists blame for their problems so they dont have to take responsibility for their own actions,NOT
i found this channel like  days ago and have been completely addicted to watching all your videos,NOT
shes not trans like you said its basically clickbait,NOT
my only problem is that you say youre trans for all the wrong reasons gender is not a choice i did not decide to be transgender but i am wanting short hair because its easier to deal with does not make you trans having a fetish for gay men does not make you trans wearing sports bras does not make you trans having gender dysphoria however does make you trans feeling overwhelming discomfort and wrongness when people call you she or a girl does make you trans if youd said something along those lines i feel like this whole thing would have gone very differently i want to support you i really really do but youre making it very difficult,NOT

im surprised that schools are violating some of the personalprivacy rights of the students so transgender females or transgender males can feel good about themselves are the state governments in on this and is the federal government in on this how do natural born female students in general feel about sharing washroom and locker rooms with transgender females when i was a teenagers i didnt want to take off my clothes in front of other females it made me very uncomfortable i remember either changing into gym clothes in the bathroom stalls or waiting for all of the girls to leave before changing into gym clothes i could imagine transgender females trying to get a sneak peek of a natural born females body so they can know how they want their bodies to look if they decide to get surgeries to become more female in the future if i was growing up now and was in high school and i even glimpse a transgender girl just checking me out for those purpose because i know im being watched by any girl i would totally take a f in gym and skip it and stay in detention this is how shy i was in school i know there are still females who are like me growing up in this day and time whose loving them and protecting their rightsprivacy i hope their loving parents and the same school board that are protecting these two i think all people should have equal rights i just dont think people should just impose themselves on others based on what they feel or think i think we should all respect each other but i feel some people feelings and rights are being violated so others can feel better about themselves we all need to learn to love ourselves regardless of how we look on the outside,NOT
if men doing most of the better jobs is why women earn less isnt that still kind of sexism,NOT

you do not want to close the wage gap the reason you have it is because you are using an average in the calculation which is not something you should ever do with a trinomial distribution the average is based on the whole male and female population and does not take into account that you have three distinct different groups low income earners medium income earners and high income earners and you have a difference between the male and female demographics in these three groups this is what causes the wage gap for example just to illustrate this say that the low income is k aud the average wage in oz is k aud a year an high income is k a year we set that to be exactly the same for both men and women then we place  of women in low pay jobs  or women in medium paid jobs and  in high pay jobs for men we set  in low pay jobs  in medium paid jobs and  in high paid jobs now we calculate the average women   k    k    k   a year men   k    k    k   a year wage gap       difference     so the wage gape is about  in this example note here that the wages are identical for all men and women the only thing that differs is the number of males and females in each group so if you want to close this wage gap you can do that in  ways  all people get the same wage irrespective of job this is communism and state controlled wagesetting  we demand the same number of men and women in all jobs in society this is again state control over who get to work where and again communism we have over  years of data based on communism it doesnt work and leads to tyranny this is why we dont want to close the wage gap because the way to do it tyrannical,NOT

its simple dont have children and work the jobs that men work and you wont get paid less this whole gender wage gas bs never takes into the account the amount of men that die in the process of making all that extra money you know for the life of me ive never seen a woman that works in the field of heavy demolition and hazmatmight have something to do with the fact you have to strip all your cloths off and run around in a paper thin tyvek suit with a papr mask for  hrs per day all while sweating your ass off all day longor freezing it off it can go both ways there is no happy medium in between our modern economy isnt based off of paying people to do basically nothing and in terms of employers its not their responsibility to pay women more because they have less free time to actually work in life its your personal choices that determine what your net worth is and if you personally think being a single motheror whatever the case is entitles you to somehow make more money for doing less work for another individualcompany your delusional thats just not how things work in north america and for that you can blame capitalism,NOT
shes gotta have schizophrenia or some shit like she needs help and i know this is kinda fucked up to say but im glad she cant have any kids because she definitely does not need to breed,NOT
an interesting problem is leaving the west eg latin america what about the wage gap here i saw ads for a job that stated the monthly income and it was different for manwoman yes they had  salary values i filled out myself a salary calculator and finally switched from male to female and rerun it the result was significant lower,NOT
totally unfair one of them was completing in mens track a month prior dont know of an argument that can be made that makes this fair especially if its a girl who is looking for a scholarship and loses out because of these two the transgender parents think their kids happiness is more important than the happiness of another child which is telling then the trans kids echo the sentiment when asked if they were on the receiving end like those that are biologically female their answer as long as the kids that are transgender are happy than that should make me happy not said in those words but that was the sentiment and i dont care of they take hormone therapy for a couple,ABU
there is no wage gap its been debunked several times problem is most women take time off and dont receive full pay for that,NOT
this video made me want to smash my head against a wall she just tried to over complicate the fact that the statistics about wage gaps between men and women arent accurate and dont take into account the different variables and the type of jobs worked i wish feminist would use their energy more constructively in helping rd world women whom are  of  wives,NOT

also watch forks over knives it is the bomb,NOT
i disagree with this statement certain individuals taking advantage of the shallow system that is causing problems to very few other individuals can not be justified as a attack on women the whole thing is just just unbearably naive i dont care about anyones opinions or their feelings what i care about is the facts and numbers the fact is they should havent been gone through any type of process of which they can be deified as transgender so they should have not been allowed to perticipate at the first place we as a society are facing some very dramatic changes we should be more careful to what we accept and reject now otherwise our future will only hold darkness for next generation we should keep an open mind but approve only with solid facts,ABU
trish please dont follow freelees advice on veganism her diet only works on some people please go watch highcarbhannah and watch her weight loss videos from before and after she looked similar to you before she went vegan and her advice is wayyyy more realistic and will work on you better please please go check her out freelees diet is sorta bs idk,NOT

wait what i mean i support trish in whatever trish wants i hope this brings you happiness,NOT
hey trish i think its amazing that you are going vegan for the next two weeks dont be scared about how much to eat or not eat just eat when you are hungry and eat until you are satiated what helps me the most whenever i need new ideas for different vegan meals i always look up vegan what i eat in a day videos they are all so helpful make sure you eat plenty of carbs and starches to fill you up because fruits and veggies alone arent high in calories at all so you need the carbs to keep you full and give you plenty of energy good luck girl,NOT
its a very poor goal to eliminate the wage gap its far more important for people to choose what they want to do rather than have collectivists decide for you what you should do so that on a graph it looks like things are equal things are never equal not between genders not between races heck i have poor eyesight and couldnt become a pilot if i wanted to the point is that people get somewhat equal opportunities and get to make the choices of what they want to do not have some regressive outlet prescribe that we need to businesses shaped in a specific way so that aggregate earnings of men and women are equal what a stupendously poor goal,NOT
when freelee says you can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet she means that if youre eating nutrient rich foods ie fruits vegetables legumes starches and a little of fats like avocado you can eat as much as you want because those foods are less calorically dense than meat and dairy and fats if you go vegan and eat fried french fries oreos or foods that are vegan imitations of nonvegan foods youll gain weight,NOT

im a normal heterosexual male  didnt hear about this gender pay gap until couple years ago at first i thought very briefly why men earned moreif anything i thought women would have earned more by giving men sexual favours to get to the tophonestly this was what i could come up with lol and i couldnt understand why a male heterosexual would even have a desire to pay women lessabsolutely nothing apparent to me but then i heard the various reasons whyfrom ppl like jordan petersonand now i know the reasons for the gap it is nothing about men deliberately or desiring to pay women less just cause they are womenits a byproduct of the choices and other stuff like how its measured etc,NOT
oatmeal rice pasta lentils vegetables fruit chia seeds hemp seeds smoothies trish on amazon they have lentil pastai got some and its filled with protein and its so good my toddlers loved it too,NOT

if a transgender woman has trouble with her prostate gland what kind of doctor should she go to,ABU
another cause is that women tend to choose similar jobs and careers meanwhile men are way more diversify these creates a lot more workers that are needed in certain jobs so the competence in those jobs rise and the salary of all those professionals is reduced why women choose the same hobbies and careers the answer is easy culture inertia since religin times most religions did not allow women to do the same things that men did they could not study work in some jobs or do almost nothing more than take care of their childs that is the gap you are looking for,NOT
she ate chicken and waffles today ,NOT
way to go vox way to be unbiased,NOT
thank you vox for helping the cause focus on the real problem its not that companies are flat out sexist and dont pay women the same pay its because of our culture and society and difference on personal preference i hope that this video will help the cause get back on track following the facts,NOT

funny they never mentioned the gender rolls that affect those numbers men of course are more likely to take longer hours because men are by many studies secondary in child bearing so the fact that men are just more willing does not cover the whole story,NOT
hahaha anaya madnessthese people are out to destroy themselves,NOT
just watch the first  seconds thats about it,NOT
wow the animation a  is really misleading  you represent en wage gap shrinking from  cents to  cents which is not the case its  cents to  cents you even mention the value later  if you want to mock people for their lack of math knowledge at least dont mess up a simple substraction i agree that more statistics knowledge and critical thinking toward statistical studies would be a good thing theres so many possibility to find the wrong answer even when being trying to be honest the choice of college field is also part of the problem as society tend to stir you toward or away from certain field depending on your gender,NOT

businesses would hire men for more money because their work is valued more its like hiring someone who is untrained just because they will take minimum wage instead of paying more for someone who is trained,NOT

wait arnold schwarzenegger is not full vegan go nole idemo,NOT
if women dont have kids they will be free from the wage gap especially since they can sue companies for the difference the problem begins when feminism opens the barriers to motherhood and the workforce many women consider it normal to work and have kids yet end up with the burden they may get help from their spouse parents or a caretaker but feel the need to bond with their child  even if they are entirely free from their chores etc many women end up being stay at home mothers feminism says theres nothing wrong with it and that it should be a paid job the many ways feminism turn women into womb when they can simply be child free,NOT
so proud of you trisha d just make sure you eat enough and of the plantbased foods that you like the most if its bread eat bread if its fruit or potatoes or rice have it its important for you to be satiated and to get all essential nutrients  for protein its everywhere beans greens cruciferous veggies grains nongmo preferably soy productss etc good luck and wish you the bestt,NOT
if you ever crave chicken tenders then gardein vegan chicken tenders are really good,NOT
these calculations may not indicate a genderwage injustice as you said given that men are more likely to go into stem fields which pay more notwithstanding proving that these are poor ways to measure gender wage gap doesnt prove that there isnt a gender wag gap a better way to measure this would be compare hourly wages of men and women in the same profession and have been working the same number of years ,NOT
protein isnt as important as you think if you eat enough calories youll get enough protein focus on eating high carb and low fat to keep you satisfied,NOT

i recently went vegan trish it was the best decision ive ever made girl i feel soooo much better,NOT
you know i am not a fan of what every single thing feminist say but there is a wag gap it is a fact that the wage gap exist it just is a fact the wage gap and if you talk to people who understand the wage gap they will tell you this takes into consideration or account different choices men and women make such as job position total hours worked also number of children and the frequency at which unpaid leave is taken in addition to other factors they do take into account the type of degree one receives in college every feminist knows this but what feminist also bring up that people hate hearing which is a real factor that exist is discrimination which accounts for  of the wage gap according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the us has the th largest gender pay gap overall and the gap in this country is bigger than the gap in most european countries the economic policy institute says in simple terms no matter how you measure it there is a gap also the reason women make the choices they do get the college degrees they do could be the result of a sexist culture maybe not saying that is the case,NOT

im a very girly girl but i am a strong woman im attracted to everyone lol you just do you screw every opinion only yours counts your inner peace your inner voice is the only voice that matters love you sis,NOT
there would be more reasons why the top five majors have more men than women is it the stereotype of men and women that contributes to this result we need to put away the stereotypes and encourage women and men to develop themselves in a diversified way when can we really stop saying choose a stable job and stay in the family you dont have to be ambitousblablablato women and somehow deters them from realizing more possiblities,NOT
i cant really watch the whole thing yet since im at work but you might want to try it longer than  weeks your body is going to need time to adjust to this new healthier lifestyle so you might find that you get tired or feel sluggish your body is just detoxing but once you get past that youll feel amazing and you wont crave all those junk foods you used to and then youll start seeing the weight come off  good luck trish ,NOT
transgender should complete against other transgenders,ABU
some of the proclaimed paygab is said to be because the mommy penalty a woman that choose to get a kid will drop in income because of that but here is the thing you women dont need to get kids right no one is forcing you and you can live the life as a man if you please men can not get children by themself so i would say that men are worse off  in  men will never reproduce in their life but its only  in  for women,NOT
 year out of business school and already making k damn,NOT

yall she recorded this like  weeks agoshe aint a vegan no more lmao she was eating meat like  seconds ago on snapchat lmao,NOT
companies that hire in fields dominated by men such as engineering will place priorities on hiring women and minorities in order to meet their diversity metrics women and minority students who wish to pursuit in a fields dominated by men will have an easier time getting scholarships because they are always trying to increase the diversity i think that men just want to be around more women lmao anyone who tries to say theres a wage gap are either lieing to you or lack experience in the real world,NOT
its so funny to me how they all look sick with those sunken in eyes their wrinkled skin and pale skin color but they think they look great they look great when they start and they still have the nutrient reserves in their liver and body fat and they loose overweight from going vegan but then after a while they turn pale and gray loose often lots of muscle mass and facial fat giving them that formaldehyde dead eyes look its sad people cant think logically and are so brainwashed with this anti human ideology its almost as if they cant think clearly anymore and the more animated they act the more it looks as if theyre trying to convince themselves theyre not weak sick and unhealthy looking ive been looking long at going vegan wondering if it would be healthy thinking it probably would be but never started until i looked at the opposite side of this diet aka the carnivore diet then it suddenly became very clear to me that veganism is an unnatural and unrealistic and polluting ideology thats based on new age drivel lies and deceit and not based on a biological reality were ourselves animals with carnivores needs and were not living on starship enterprise the planet would be better of if we all ate meat and let the animals freely graze on the planet everywhere since they can eat the plants we cant eat and we dont have to dig up the soil use pesticides or artificial fertilizers and nature could just be nature we just had to stimulate the facilitation for them to give lots of offspring and we could eat them without hardly any need for the cultivation of land destroying nature,ABU
oh boy  we definitely choose to take  cents less,NOT
the only way the wage gap is going to be fixed is if men stop being stereotyped to be the provider and start being shown as a care giver like being nurses or teachers more often oh and of course take care of their dam children,NOT
i never wear makeup or dress upam i man now,NOT
trisha  youre not a man but when you do too much xanax you do end up looking like a caveman  you just want to be accepted into a communitylike her bs religious songs and acts,ABU
its not factually correct if you have to give so much context its far less deceiving to say that men and women make the same amount per hour on the same job whoops thats wrong too women are being paid more in some jobs on that equivalent scale now but im glad vox gave context even if the video still keeps saying wage gap when there is none when you factor in everything,NOT
what alternative to cows milk would you suggest for a baby,NOT
soon many farms will run out of the water and soil quality necessary to grow vegan food the pesticides may also kill off all the bugs necessary to pollinate crops ruminant animals dont need fertilizer pesticide or irrigation they are quite happy on land where crops cannot be grown vegans cant even digest the food they eat bacteria must digest it for them then most of the fats the bacteria create are excreted instead of absorbed because the bacteria are in the colon its difficult to regard a diet that requires supplementation with respect,NOT

i dont give a fuck if reality offends you men or bigger stronger and outreach better at physical competition than women it is unfair for a man to compete in a physical competition against a woman this is stupid,ABU
i agree there is no wage gap however this also ignores that while yes women lean to lower paying jobs for a women in a male dominated field it can be very discouraging and uncomfterable turning many women from picking that feild there is no wage gap but women are discouraged from many high paying desgrees not intentionally but rather just because a girl in a sausage fest is bound to feel uncomfortable,NOT
i was so so happy,NOT
fuck thatthey are not grls its not fair ill sign my step daughter runs for lsu  its not fair,ABU
thank you for making this an adwoman are really stupid these days complaining and they need to stop,ABU
its more complex than the  cents figure ok but the unfounded assumption that there is a problem and that its unfair to women is still just asserted because i guess thats the culture we live in you have to wimminworst,NOT
people will start thinking they are transgender when they just feel insecure about themself ,NOT
this is the video we neeeed,NOT
i dont see anything wrong with this video edit the circumstances of which this video is complaining about or inciting should change the reasons for the pay gap make sense and in a capitalist society especially in business economies which are driven by competition men seem more capable to meet the demand made by those companies that are competing with other companies hence there are more men in these economies than women and the men achieve higher and better paying positions because they have the damn time to its not like a woman cant achieve fair pay i think we are doing better than ever by far when it comes to equality of opportunity but how does it make sense to alter the function of a business in a competition based economy just to fit a post modernist perspective of egalitarianism why should the outcome be equal if the factors arent,NOT
terry miller  who won st ran a   hed get smoked by the boys in the  meterwouldnt even qualify for leagues district finals,NOT

you live in a house made of wood which was the home of many birds and insects until people destroyed their environment so that you can have a house but identify as vegan pff,NOT
i would love to share this video but would probably get shit for it,NOT
so a  cents is acceptable  the problem with this video is that you dont look deep enough you explain the differences by choices of career carreer evolution and working hour this is where the sexist issues are when choosing an orientation women are told that petroleum ingeneering etc is for men and that early education nursing and such are for women as for evolution we see that with equal education a man will be more and faster promoted than a women a study gave the same curriculum to companies half with the name john half with the name jessica the companies were willing to pay john  a year more than jessica that is sexism in the enterprise finally women are working less hour because they are still the ones who have to take care of the children of the house etc so of course they cant stay as long in the office once all these problems have been addressed then we will see equality since you like maths you should know that according to the millions of people we are talking about the law of large numbers applies aif there was no inequality the pay difference should be infinitesimal thanks for reading until the end it shows open mindness,NOT
sorry men have different anatomies from women its not just muscle but bones and pelvic structure long hair and hormones dont change all of that this is the world we live in now,ABU
sooo it doesnt exist women just work shorter hours choose the jobs they want that also coincidentally pay less and so many other things give  average women the chance to be in a computer job and do the same for men and the results will be different shocking i know,NOT

the reason women often do more chores help kids esc is because males often go to work more this simply has to do with the fact that women on average enjoy being with their kids more meaning that a women is more likely to stay at home peace,NOT
 no its not thanks for the video bye,NOT
 k  after business school and kk after  years is this harvard or something this seems like an awful lot,NOT
men can work longer hours because they arent at home taking care of their children in  of homes women do the majority of household chores and taking care of their children when sick not to mention a vast majority of single parents are women the earnings gap is very small when men and women are both out of college and working the same position however women earn less over time when they have children and then have to take care of them,NOT

yasss trish this makes me so happy ive been such a fan of you for so long ive began vegan for  months and vegetarian for  year i love this lifestyle i feel great and i hope you find what youre looking for within it,NOT
i was thinking the same thing like why cant an experiment be done where men and women work the exact same job and hours do the exact same things in the workrelated area for a month or so then compare wages without the employer being aware of the experiment and then see it they got the same amount of money or not if there is a difference between their wages then something is up otherwise the wage gap isnt a sexist thing,NOT
if you are doing a mostly raw diet you definitely need to eat more food fruits and vegetables have high water content and lower calories so you need to eat more than you have been to fill the same calorie goals that is the only way for you to sustainably stay on the vegan diet,NOT
idk if in your countries is like that but in mine men oftenly promote other men to high positions just because they are drinking friends or stuff like that when women can be excellent bosses just as men,NOT

the wage gap is simply the average earning of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,NOT
welcome to the vegan life here are some things that helped me when i transitioned from vegetarian to full vegan  water water water water your body is about to go on a journey so be nice to yourself and keep it clean  fruit for breakfast its the easiest meal plan ever you can have as much as youd like and the fruit you consume in the morning pushes out what you ate the day before  be kind to yourself this is a new lifestyle and you will make mistakes thats ok just make a mental note about what you ate dont buy it again and move on  if weight loss is your main inspiration for going vegan check out the skinny bitch books they have a sharp tone but are also funny and informative  when you cant take it any more and are seriously craving junk food remember oreos are accidentally vegan ,NOT

the entire male track team should join the female track team claiming they identify as females then everyone will realize how ridiculous this actually is,NOT
i think its incredibly ignorant for you to imply that for trisha to actually be trans they have to transition im not defending trisha and saying if theyre tans or not but you saying the the only way you would believe trish is if they transitioned is you implying that any trans person needsto transition to be an actual trans person,NOT

expected feminist propaganda instead got a fair video explaining that the wage gap exists for a reason not because of sexism if only all of voxs videos were this unbiased and werent seeping with propaganda,NOT
great to see that youre openminded to try going vegan def dont be scared of carbs  good carbs like lentils beans and quinoa are super healthy low fat high protein and will keep you satisfied,NOT
im a longtime advocate of whole plantbased diet and im very supportive of anything that gets large portions of the population to make the switch away from animal products however the attitude toward food and diet and what we associate it with needs to change as well food and diet should be viewed primarily as a component of health and hygiene instead we are all too often associating food with pleasure celebration and entertainmentwhich also includes all vices such as alcohol tobacco illegal drugs gambling pornography casual sexual encounters and many other hedonistic obsessions that are all harmful to health in the longrun people eating some of these new plantbased substitutes for burgers sausages and other animal foods are holding on to their traditional sources of pleasure i also agree that we need to eliminate animal farming for various reasons including environmental protection but again it is folly to believe this will solve the problems we face with pollution and climate warming the only solution that will ever have a chance of saving us from ourselves if it isnt already too late is to dramatically downsize human impact on the planet and that can only happen by an equally dramatic downsizing of the global population unless that happens and happens consistently and fairly quickly we are toastall the other efforts to reverse climate change will not be sufficient not even close,NOT
blaire please may i lick out your bumhole,NOT

never been more proud of you you go girl,NOT
this video had a starburst ad lol,NOT
the main thing people miss about the pay gap is that it doesnt really exist there are laws preventing discriminatory pay what the  cents to the dollar myth comes from is a broad brush evaluation of what all men earn vs what all women earn apples to oranges when you actually factor in things like hours worked education and experience and the same career the wage gap disappears,NOT
like all immoral stuff the media pushes nothing,NOT
sis delete this video,NOT
obviously they have an advantage what if lebron james became trans and wanted to play in the wnba or mike tyson got on hormone therapy for a year and wanted to box as a woman what will happen is eventually so many trans males will transition there will be only trans winners andor trans girls teams because biological females wont be able to compete,NOT
good for you trish ,NOT

blair your lil boogie,NOT
freelee reaction video,NOT
why not give  women already in top  who have been psychologically profiled as unwilling to distribute their money to the bottom  an extra trillion or two dollars then youll have distribution of wealth similar to how it is among men and then youll have raised the amount women earn the way it is distributed among men  mens lives arent better in the slightest and arent earning a dime more because a bunch of people at the  top are disproportionally men,NOT
u dont do it for the animals u do it for your music video lol,NOT
while on a vegan diet its extremely certain you exercise from  to  times a week depending on how you feel just take a  minute walk scrunches even jogging trisha you dont even need it much your body is beautiful,NOT
god i love meat with milk,NOT
starting from today its illegal in iceland for there to be a gender wage gap,NOT
ok so as someone who did used to think the wage gap was more of a big deal im glad for this clarification but the wage gap isnt the only inequality between genders in the workplace is there anyone that knows of a paper that compares the salaries of women and men who work the same job i was disappointed that this video didnt cover that difference since that is probably where the ish wage gap that does exist comes from legitimate question btw im not looking to pick a fight,NOT
there is no wage gap it it proven that women take off more time and work less hours then men,NOT
my sister is a hardcore feminist and she tried to brainwash me along with my professors i knew something wasnt right,NOT
oh my god its like youre so close to understanding the earnings gap but your lack of logic and critical thinking is keeping you at the brink of understanding something so incredibly simple,NOT
i really think this was a troll that went bad idk i thought it was hilarious,NOT
freelee is going to be so proud,NOT
where r ur sources and links to articles,NOT
for protein hemp hearts almonds tofu edamame beens have organic oatmeal it will keep you full if you want to sweeten it up add stevia or real maple syrup,NOT
so the soulution is to force women to work in profession that they dont want just too have the same pay yay great soulution by feminists taking awaya women right to choose her job,NOT
trish youre awesome d,NOT
um how about instead we stop making women do all the child care and stop penalizing them for it not to mention this is not a complete picture for instance even in those jobs that have closer salaries women still did make less so wheres the explanation there how about the increased wage gap for women of color not to mention we always talk about women choosing to go into fields that make less money when really we just value the labor of women less if tons of women are doing it it must be easy so we shouldnt pay them as much,NOT
they do have an unfair advantage,NOT
dont majority females get along better with males cause less bitching also dont we always dress down at home and then dress up to go out this is so strange,NOT
now their argument is going to be woman are oppressed into choosing lower paying jobs because men are scary,NOT
the last line of holding a chic fil a cup and saying this is vodka by the way was so iconic,NOT
trish im so glad you are deciding to try veganism for protein you can try eating beanslegumes and whole grains vegetables also contain protein you just need to eat higher volumes of vegetables because they have less calories and even though your goal is weight loss you can try mock meat and cheeses every once and a while whenever you are craving animal products for starbucks you can order your drinks with soy and it tastes just as yummy good luck,NOT
you lefties live in lala land what business owner would pay more for the same work,NOT
does vox know that its illegal to pay a woman less for the same job,NOT
so the point of the video is saying that there is no wage gap by explaining why there is a wage gap,NOT
sorry but you forgot a main reason women work less hours and earn less because of it theyre expected to be the parent who stays with the children while the men are expected to work fully because theyre the breadwinner there are both men and women who want this to change there are men who want to be more present at home but cant find a job who provide them that and because of that the women have to stay with the children or else when men and women will be expected to be a parent and a worker equally then it will be changed,NOT
trish gets lazy and doesnt want to get ready in the morning her im trans,NOT
no wonder u cant have kids,NOT
moms take care of their kids and work just like their husbands you either married a loser or should just not have kids if that bothers you,NOT
any other type factory can or might destroy the planet,NOT

funny thing is you can only change the appearance of anatomy laws of nature,NOT
so many things have lactose products in them such as chips packaged french fries candy etc so be careful and readsearch ingredients,NOT

i do not think that people who perpetuate the wage gage myth do not like telling the truth but are to focused on creating a problem they do not research the information that is given,NOT
ive never seen so many nazi and bigot in the comment section before s,NOT
yall mind if you sight your sorces,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap  it doesnt exist,NOT
even as a vegan you need to watch the calories you consume especially if youre trying to lose weight the key to weight loss is to burn more calories than you consume so if you eat  calories on a vegan diet and dont get off your couch you wont see any results either way i wish you the best and i hope you see a difference ,NOT
sooo pretty much just tell the father to take care of his kids,NOT
as a transwoman i must say that even if i were to train and train and train every single one of those ciswomen could leave me in the dust in a sprint race  and i have very long legs the notion that transgender women have an unfair advantage over ciswomen in athletics is just not realistic,NOT
i cant see why this has over  dislikes do people not undertand that the truth is different from many narratives,NOT
love you freelee,NOT
how is it even mildly controversial to say that biological males with an xy chromosome have a physical advantage over a biological female with a xx chromosome im all for tolerance of trans folks but this is beyond ridiculous,NOT
yesss trishhh hummus and celery is a really good snack and great for protein,NOT
a woman stays at home and she is a housewife a guy stays at home and he is a deadbeat,NOT
i thought you werent making videos anymore,NOT
men and women make different choices women in the us do not all work and even if they worked women chose less paying jobs while men majoritaly make choices to work in businesses and ceos and take a whole different route than women bref women are more likely to work worst paying jobs while men work best paying this is factually correct vox doesnt know what is called facts the statistics of  cents to every dollar a man make doesnt account for each sex choses to work the sexes are different brain difference and social attitudes and now choices in life if you account for that the gap narrows to the point of vanishing edit this is a brief summary of tge response now about the topic or most of it of the video they dont account for most of these things  men work more hours than women because of that men are more paid than women this is not sexist this is common sense when someone work more that person get more paid men work more so they get more paid men often do the dirty work such cleaning  women often leave their jobs for maternity the statistics shows that they get paid less well did they account for the losing of jobs for mother purposes it is very factual that women leave their jobs raising kids more than men do for their children and even if they stayed as i said women work less hours after entering motherhood  in this video they talked about businesses and tech amd one more thing well these fields are dominated by men men are the majority of these fields women are not in fact out of the  worst paying jobs in the us  out of them are dominated by women while the other are men while out of the  best paying jobs in the us  out of them are majoritaly men and the other is women that statistics reflect the choices women and men do but wait does that proves sexism in the work place no that is because women dominate biology and medicine and single women are paid more than their male courter part however married women are paid less because they work less hours and even leave their jobs while men work more hours therefore are paid more they do the dirty jobs such cleaning the sewage and suffer from suicide overwhelmingly and in work men die more than women die in work,NOT
thats so awesome that youre going vegan if you do it properly youll feel happier healthier and just  more positive steering clear of animal products cleared up my skin i dropped a little weight my stamina went up etc and i didnt realise how guilty i actually felt until i stopped eatingdrinking those things i hope you stick with it girl there are supportive vegans out there dont let the angry minority shape your opinion ,NOT
never thought about being vegan a day in my life thought that freelee was just really annoying when she told people to go vegan i watched farm to fridge im going on a plant based diet,NOT
trisha in the thumbnail looks like troy bolton if he got lip injections,NOT
its factory farming thats an issue not all meat comes from factory farming,NOT
there are more dislikes than likes,NOT
i eat so much meat i fart moos,NOT
very unfair cut this bullshit out,NOT
so this video says that the wage gap doesnt come down to gender but what a woman can achieve versus what a man can achieve a woman has to take care of children and has more duties outside of her job so she cannot be as reliable on her job as a man thus she cannot be as good as her job as a man and that is for every job that requires flexible hours like business careers thus she gets paid as much as a man given her achievements this is very interesting that being said why is the conclusion we need jobs to be more flexible for women and not we need to balance housework between men and women how is it normal for a woman to have more duties outside of her work than a man dont both parents have as much responsibility towards their own children towards their own house,NOT
that it doesnt exist,NOT
none of these issues occur in male sports any coincidence its only happening with male to female trans athletes,NOT
the people disliking it are the people who see the facts and dont like them because it doesnt support their dogma and narrative,NOT
that footage got lost from both sides maybe a meat industry paid spy stole it,NOT
so i guess this proves that there are differences between men and women,NOT
so glad i made the decision to go vegan the beginning of this year ive learned alot and now i have my husband going vegan as well,NOT
hmm to each its own but because a man changes his clothes to woman clothes and chooses to sleep with men also in his mind hes a woman also mimics what he feels like a woman acts like now hes equal to a natural born woman even though naturally also his genetic is still male and if he still has or have had a prostate hes male,ABU
why should i an apprentice mechanic make less than a brain surgeon we both work we both deserve more money,NOT
this is ridiculous these dudes keep dominating girls sporting events why are yall pretending as if they dont have an unfair advantage,ABU
 trisha and i and i me oop,NOT
wage gap women are not eqaul to men psychologically more unstablehormonally unbalanced and men tend to have better judgement and are more driven the women who do well emulate those traits switch women and men for women being a starving athlete and men as bodybuilders no one would complain if the body builder lifted more weights could out eat moreyet we do the same for womenboxers have weightclasses for a reason,ABU
i think shes suffering from some type of trauma where she was raised to believe not doing your hair or makeup means youre a man obviously whoever made her believe that was a significant in her life and theyre sexist as fuck she needs to let go of that trauam before she becomes stable again there is so much she holds on to,NOT
why did not she mention pregnancy and raising children are not those the major factors affecting employers decisions regarding their employees in context of gender,NOT
i dont wanna hate and say mean things like others but in the nicest way to say is that you should try to get some help if u need to talk to someone you should if you really are anything but straight you might be nonbinary thats when you sometimes wake to be a women some days and a guy other days theythem are only used mostly for nonbinaries if you want to bea guy you would say hehim in your case i personally dont believe this  because it dosent seem like you are to sexually orientated informed other things have been said by you you need some sort of help i am a closeted bi and some of the things you said were offensive i cant even imagine what actual transgenders feel right now you want to be a female and male if this is true your probably nonbinary,NOT
im plant based and love it and feel great because of it but it is nobodys business what others do the makers of this film are no better than the big meat producers lots of falsehoods in here being an extremist in any direction is bad,NOT
to each their own but i believe that god gave us animals and plants to eat so bring on the meat  dairy ,NOT
i feel so ashamed being transgenderbecause of this,NOT
this is totally wrong this is discrimination against women muscle mass testosterone everything i mean if this is fine then why not let high school athletes use steroids biologically male people competing in womens sports is exactly the type of thing that will turn normal people like me against the transgender movement,NOT
aid agent too advanced,NOT
goodluck girl eat as much food as you please and feel amazing hopefully you will stick to it in about to be months,NOT
well and there lies the problem once you redefine what is to be male and female facts dont matter anymore minorities deserve protection however facts do matter,NOT
just ridiculous estrogen takes awhile to shut down testosterone production plus these two girls are at the height of male puberty they have a very good advantage,NOT
you guys she is a gay man trapped in a womans body so she makes the best of the body shes born in annnd lives as a drag queen because shes a gay man trapped in a girls body duuuuuh disclaimer this comment was intended at poking fun of trisha not gonna lie and not intended to promote hate on her or any other group of people who wish to identify as whatever they seem fit ,NOT
i know that i am being kind of picky here but median is not the average median is just the number that appears in the stats and is not the average in many cases mean is the average just saying again i know that i sound picky for saying this but i just like math a lot and dont want even a small risk of people getting confused there are a lot of idiots online,NOT
trish we need you around forever go healthy go vegan,NOT
asian cuisine will be your best friend so many delicious vegan options ,NOT
like i am trans and some transphobic person sent this to me and he ligit said this is why the transgender community is gross and its all just a faze so like wow,NOT
i bet we can play spot the feminist in this comment section,NOT
unfair for sure,ABU
 of the  year olds saying the wage gap doesnt exist dont know that the video agrees with them its a good idea to watch the video first then comment,NOT
trishas video is embarrassing to watch,NOT
i guess im a transgender gay man because i lounge looking like a bum more than i dress up  id understand if she was trying to say she is gender fluid but all her reasonings are not even validbeing trans or even genderfluid has nothing to do with who youre attracted to nor does it have anything to do with gender stereotypes,NOT
whatttt im very confused,NOT
facts thank you for this  feminism needs to be removed from humanity,ABU
is this a joke trish i havent been watching you for a while im sorry but is this a prank or something somebody tell me edit  i just read the comments and um i am a lesbian and this is horrible trisha i watched you for a while now and you were my getaway and i just wow,NOT
i agree with with many of the points in this video however i do think it would have been interesting to look into why there was a higher concentration of women in low paying fields i noticed many of the lower paying fields could be seen as more of a nurturing career path perhaps linked to the traditional idea of femininity and as said in the video workers who were more willing to be on call at all hours were better funded but being on call for single mothers  of single parent households would be difficult also in many households the mother is seen as the prime child carer limiting their ability to take on roles with round the clock call in,NOT
maybe youre like gender fluid or something else but i kinda think that you just dont wanna be objectified as yourself,NOT
men will work harder chat less and are more resistant to stress that will also make money but if you give women same money regardless you simply lose money and eventually lose those male workers who will decide to find job elsewhere,ABU
women before us have fought for our rights to compete in sports fairly and this is what happens if there is no difference than there is no need for segregated sex teams biology doesnt care about feelings hormones dont mean anything when youve gone through puberty and have all the benefits of a male physic have transgender women sports because the fact is trans women are not the same as women its honestly sad to see girls and women being pushed out of our own spaces,ABU
i dont care what you call yourself i really dont if you want to be called a she ill call you a she no complaints but the average man is a better athlete than the average woman the best male athlete is a better athlete than the best female athlete this is fact this means that the category you compete in should be dictated by biological sex,ABU
my my brain i i just,NOT
can we just retire trisha to the farm now its becoming inhumane to let her keep going on as she is,NOT
good for you trish,NOT
trish you are amazing,NOT
trisha forgot a part the transgender community always called mean idiot,NOT
love it womens sports are stupid anyway we shouldnt be wasting resources on them this will destroy title  and this will destroy womens events at the olympics and good riddance,ABU
so what i understand is that men earn more money because they got better jobs my question is why is it not   males who get these jobs and  females,NOT
i bet all the dislikes are from feminazis,NOT
if women get paid less then why dont companies hire only women lol,NOT
its completely stupid to say this is unfair,NOT
this is unfair i do the shot put in track and field and i cant imagine competing against a transgender women with the build and strengths of a man i have no problem against transgenders but theres a line for sports females cannot physical compete for strength or muscle build with male build its why the sport is split by gender,ABU
silk yogurt is awesome,NOT
yasss trish im so excited for you,NOT
no way oh my god yes trish make sure to eat enough carbs so u are not hungry all the time you can eat pasta even white rice eat whatever u want as long as its vegan,NOT
my experience has been that i find a greater majority of men at an executive level than women but i see far more women at middle management roles there will be a trend shift as women take on more and more executive roles  it seems inevitable,NOT
not vegan bruh,NOT
after all the controversy over chickfila i love that she is eating it anyway ,NOT
you know i do recall wanting to take more psych classes because that was the major where the girls were at however i was the fly on the wall of a few conversations where male hiring managers did discuss how between two candidates they female would be cheaper but you could depend on the male the decision was to hire the male because they valued dependability as mentioned in this video over saving the company a few hundred dollars a decision they felt would cost them more in the long run it was only one instance but i know it couldnt be the only instant in the world were that discussion was held behind closed doors and i know somewhere down the line the choice of cost would be valued more than dependability a non profit i worked for valued the latter but the boss terrorized the employees by threatening the boot if they werent dependable at every corner a male worker there was discovered to be making more than his female replacement who was wonderful and very dependable but sadly underpaid for her service these videos have great facts but miss that there is an element a bias human element that does come into play when it comes to wages my wife also suffered this while working retail where a male counter part at her same level did less work but was paid higher and my wife was very dependable shit so dependable that we barely saw each other due to the demand of the job,NOT
to put it simply there is difference in income by choice not wage,NOT
this was pretty good why downvote,NOT
who remembers trishas best coming out video where she said she identified as achicken nugget,NOT
you dont pull ugly faces you pull comically appropriate very expressive faces,NOT
go vegan by all means  but the fake food why the ingredients are appalling and so much packaging just crazy  sooo much propaganda yes im confused i always believed plant based to be superior and healthier but through my own experience i have found this not to be true for me anyway,NOT
shes probably just ugly,NOT
feminism i fear no gender inequality but that one thing facts it scares me,NOT
please stop my brain hurts,NOT
is this announcer practicing her npr voice,NOT
women dont have to race if they feel the race is unfair when a transgender turns up let them rum by themselves,ABU
the average highschool teacher earns less than the average ceo the teacher must be under oppression,NOT
like i said before they need to have their own track and gather all transgendered people categorize them i e all transgendered males should compete only to transgendered male and do not mix that with females and vice versa that way everyone is happy this goes for all sports like wrestling mma all sports,ABU
wage gap doesnt exist but earning gap does,NOT
say it vegans scary man seriously its like a virus or something its like people have no selfcontrol i mean honestly you look at celebrities you look at all these people on youtube that vegan thats enough to scare the fuck out of you not because im acting towards each other its because its like nobody has in mind its for the animals its for the animals on my god people lost a there realness like sheep following sheep im just glad im a flexitarian because no way in hell i would ever be vegan im not interested in joining a clut and im going to say this is trish really do become vegan she lose a lot of subscribers because we look at trish as an independent person not perfect person if she become a sheep she wont be interesting anymore suddenly all the sudden she would lose a lot of subscribers,NOT
the devil is alive and well,NOT
also there is that little thing called equal pay act of ,NOT
wait is she a male or female,NOT
very well done thank you,NOT
theres no way she doesnt have multiple personalities ,NOT
piers morgan what a tosser,NOT
im not the kind of guy to try and force my beliefs upon others so only read if youre interested but i feel like some guys get caught up on this sort of women are being greedy or selfimportant or just want to criticise men sort of view and like yes there is a small percent of jerks who will confirm that stereotype but i also think its silly that so many guys act like it is a hit to there pride to acknowledge that there may be some male favouritism going on i really feel like that isnt necessary here is my beliefs at least i want everyone to have an equal shot at things if there seems to be some cultural favouritism or discrepancy in equality that is correctable we should strive for fixing it whether searching for furthered equality helps me or not i will support it because i would hope that others support support me in times that dont benefit them were all just kicking about on this planet lets not forget were all the same,NOT
that is great you are going vegan for the animals the planet and your health subscribed,NOT
does anyone know how freelee got the download and download hd buttons on the video,NOT
unless youre going to be doing raw till four i would still watch my calories a bit if i were youcheck out unnatural vegan here on youtube for a more down to earth approach to veganism ,NOT
i still dont know for sure if being vegan is healthy or not but vegans please stop saying the strongest animals are vegan so therefore we should be its the stupidest argument ever and literally makes no sense different species of animals have different internal systems that process food differently its the same as a meat eater saying cheetahs are the fastest mammal on earth and they are carnivore so therefore i should be carnivore ,NOT
in a word bullsht but very convenientsic timing yup going vegan to lose weight by eating a calorically unrestricted diet lmao between this genius and the fruitfly this box of crayons is still missing a few,NOT
as usual using a childs distinction between man and woman to say she identifies as a man a trans man that is a drag queen ya sure honey,NOT
i was hoping you would do a video talking about this made me so happy to see it in my subscription box,NOT
go to high carb hannahs channel trish you dont need to just eat fruit and veggies your maine thing to eat is carbs omg its a miracle all you want pasta rice beans potatoes and more  please read this comment ,NOT
the lgbt community completely baffles me for years people have actually taken their lives and spent their lives representing the community so they can be accepted and not judged treated the same way which im all for but then when the community finally gets somewhere they turn around well i say they i shouldnt group everyone together i mean a few certain others like blaire they turn around and say no  you cant be that your this your not allowed because thats what everyone else is like yall baffle me if you want to be accepted you probably shouldnt be turning around telling others what they are and arent allowed to be  get your sht straight no pun intended,NOT
transgender should compete against transgender wtf is this,ABU
i feel really bad for the girls who have to compete vs the boys its totally not fair college scholarships are on the line for a few of the real girls,ABU
on a side notethey are fucking ugly lol,ABU
trisha is  trolling do i think she wanted to hurt people no do i think she knew people would be hurt by this yes shes in it for the views and shes good at that,NOT
last summer i worked as a waiter at a college one month i got paid  more than one of my counterparts who just happened to be a woman modern feminism would look at this and say that the college i worked for was sexist as me being a male earned more than my female counterpart what they would overlook is the fact that i worked more over time and didnt take any of my earned holiday and so was compensated for it at the end of the month i did this not because men work harder but because i had student debt to pay off in this case i was on the exact same salary about  an hour and was contracted for  hours a week this is a prime example of how the wages and earnings are two totally different things you can be on the same salary but have different incomes depending on holidays taken and overtime worked its a shame feminism has gotten caught up in this hysterical regressive liberal movement as feminism is one of the greatest triumphs of the th century,NOT
flexible hours also help with mental health and stress this is a great goal to work towards for everyone,NOT
as a real transgender man this is ridiculous,NOT
please put one in spanish lots of latin americans are trying to get on the vegan train but everything worth watching is just in english we could reach so much more if the videos and info was both english and spanish,NOT
k ideologues disliked this video because individualism bad,NOT
freelee omg yay a plane piss off plane oh my god love that too much,NOT

trish is no going vegan  we all know that because she is not a committed person she will crave that nasty chicken in the middle of the night,NOT
fcking vocal fry,NOT
women am i right,NOT
this made me so happy good thing i watched this in the morning,NOT
subscribe to supremebanana she shows that all food can be vegan and i really do recommend,NOT
no its called an earnings gap you autists and its mainly because men usually have higherpaying jobs and as far as i know tend to keep their jobs for longer amounts of time on average besides that theres a variety of different reasons for different pay averages,NOT
as a transgender person myself and all the bull crap i have to go through and constant misgenderings and looks and laughs any ounce of positivity i might enjoy when i try on a new outfit or get properly gendered or even just seeing myself how i want to i feel idiots like this make my little accomplishments be squashed to nothing and me made to look worthless im tired of it either support us or dont but dont make real trans ppl look like we dont matter,NOT
you and your cat the end ,NOT
freelee is probably responsible for most people going vegan vegetarian shes the only reason im going vegetarian with the view to going vegan a while after she really opened my eyes and i can only thank her for that i dont see why barely anyone else thanks her,NOT
i feel like she is so mixed up about terms and what it means to be transgender she just wants to be casual and seen as a person rather than a sex object which is how she associates women probably because most of the time thats her experience and thats not something anyone should have to just accept and like thats totally valid but that doesnt necessarily mean that shes a man being comfortable not wearing makeup in your day to day life and being super low maintenance except when you want attention is not a trait specific to men thats how a lot of cis women are too not wanting attention from random straight men is not a trait specific to men having short hair as a woman doesnt make you trans i have a boys haircut but im a female it seems like much of her reasoning is just based off of bias of how women and men and gay men and straight men are supposed to be or usually are instead of grouping all straight men in with toxic masculinity and misogyny we need to recognize that any man can be feminine if he wants and of course all men should respect women of course i know its mostly straight men who dont and who sexualize women and all this but its not exclusive to straight men either also her comment about having penis envy is another reason i think shes just mixed up she equates men with power and having a penis with the way shes percieved she is a woman but the trauma shes experienced from being a woman especially a very outwardly sexual woman in todays society has caused her to have extreme biases towards what certain genders mean im not blaming her this is mostly indicative of a larger problem in todays society but i feel bad for her that she thinks she has to come to terms with being transgender in order to just live comfortably and dress how she wants very concerned with outward image and she feels like she needs to be trans to justify it,NOT
a little bit of backfiring for america,NOT
was onboard then you showed that little tool greta thurnburg stop with the climate change scam already animal agriculture is a win climate change itself is total bull shit,NOT
could also add that women usually spend more money and are easier affected by marketing tricks so even if paid more they would still end with less,NOT
oh congrats we love you be sure youve got a good blender for soups and smoothies ,NOT
i love how she is pretending to react to a video that she paid trisha to make,NOT
trans people are just confusing asf they want all this shit fuck trans people unstable minded ass people,ABU
you can do it babe ,NOT
im happy for you ,NOT
it is unfair they are biologically male which means they naturally have more muscle mass larger organs and more stamina i think that the school needs to create  more separate categories  for transgender women and the other for transgender men problem solved,NOT
healthy fake meat,NOT
who came here only to add dislikes  like ,NOT
i wonder how this will affect the big track fields olympics and world champs why not create their own segment its complicated this cause there is somewhat an unfair advantage ,NOT
triggered someone  xd,NOT
yes girl you got this,NOT
can you make a video about democratic candidates,NOT
thanks for all your great work ,NOT
bruh stop your just a transtrender smh ,NOT
trish the reason you got bigger when you were  us not because you were eating to much it is because your body is getting use to the food or something like that it is in one if freelys videos,NOT
hmmm choices maybe its not really choices but gender roles embedded in our society that in turn control or substantially affect these choices why do women chose majors like teaching or counseling or nursing because those are the rolesmajors women are generally expected to be interested in by choosing these majors they are less likely to have to compete with males and more likely to get the job when it comes to jobs like attorney ceo so forth these are jobs predominantly maintained by males and women are more likely to have to compete with them why does this competition matter if the woman is just as good an applicant oh because women are thought to have to pick up the kids when their sick be home in time to pick the kids up from school and have kids which means paid maternity leave and the list goes on thereby lessening the hours she can work and making her less competitive that also answers the hours question,NOT
if you were interested in trying some fake meats i personally really like the stuff from frys family im not sure if they sell those where you are you just have to make sure you check the labels for things because sometimes fake meats have like egg or dairy products just remember to try not to beat yourself up too much if you do accidentally eat something that is non vegan youll just know not to get it the next time round going vegan even for a short period of time can be difficult for people who arent used to it so just do the best you can really were all here to support you good luck xx,NOT
on average women who do not have kids have a higher earnings over  years compaired to a woman who had kids gee i wonder why haha,NOT
you have to be one of the most genuine truthtelling humans out there and you do it respectfully and i respect that   despite calling people dumb theres a thought train there not a nonsensical stream of unconsciousness you go girl ,NOT
 you want more money  if there was a wage gap why not just hire woman  shut up its feminist talk,NOT
blaire really why why are we talking about this lol,NOT
the wage gap gets smaller and smaller the older they get almost like the wage gap has been about completely removed from existence in ,NOT
how is the overtime that more and more i am agreeing with bill oreilly and its not me that is changed its bill oreilly i swear it is,NOT
watch momytangs videos,NOT
every hospital should only serve plant based foods to their patients every school should only serve plant based foods to their students every restaurant should add vegan options on their menus,NOT
blaire i literally waited for your response so i can decide how her video was supposed to make me feel,NOT
its bothering me how trishas face looks like its trying to melt off her face like just a deflated balloon,ABU
nothing against transgender people but this is wrong,NOT
woo hoo so exciting freelee will be so happy,NOT
so we have at least  suicidal mental nut jobs running around american high schools bring back state run mental hospitals and the  hold the fear of being declared a mental nut job and being held in a psych ward for  hours would prevent most of these attention whores from being like this,ABU
freelee i personally didnt like you until the jenna  julien podcasts my feelings towards you are still iffy im not gonna lie but i want to try going vegas for a  weeks because i am feeling unhealthy i figured you are the best person to go to please help me also i have a channel sub,NOT
good job vox interesting info with facts that comments against common notions instead of just following them a good step in the right direction,NOT
women do not just choose to have less paid jobs they dont have much choice based on their experience which doesnt always depends just on them,NOT
you can get your starbucks drinks with almond soy or coconut milk,NOT
congratulations on going vegan trisha i am also happy to support you with vegan meal ideas terrific inspiration freelee,NOT
almonds chickpeas broccoli hummus beans,NOT
kalel said theres a whole vegan part of whole foods so hit that up,NOT
sothe argument really is that women want the same wage as a petro engineer while being a social worker,NOT
im showing this to me mammy,NOT
freelee i need help please so slowly im transitioning from vegetarian to vegan and ive got all the food to vegan and now i just need to switch makeup and beauty products some things i bought were very very expensive and some were hardly used and i dont wanna put hundreds of dollars to waste like that because quite frankly i cant afford that would it be fine if i kept those products and used them but never bought them again afterwards and theyre not made with animal products at all they just did animal testing,NOT
omg trish i am so proud of you your fat will drop off just make sure you eat heaps so glad that you know the truth behind the animal product industry now and you are spreading the word favourite video ever xxxxx,NOT
yeah dating as a trans guy is really hard you wouldnt understand,NOT
wheres the trans olympian winner who won after transition didnt think so wheres the biological advantage weve had not one openly transwomen even place rd in the olympics do research instead of typing shit you know nothing about you loser little peasants,NOT
median earnings learn the difference between wages and earnings,NOT
excuse me but i have a degree in feminist dance theory and im still getting paid less than people with electrical engineering degrees thats s e x i s m,NOT
that doesnt change the fact that this is a problem we need to teach women to make the right choices,NOT
i pray every morning for that poor kitchen floor,NOT
why you dont eat a balanced diet meatvegetables,NOT
i notice child support wasnt mentioned,NOT
liberals damn you facts,NOT
trisha to get protein you can eat lots of protein shakes and also have lots of beans  fish  if you choose to eat fish  broccoli ,NOT
mmmmmm meat i fucking love it,NOT
im need to lay down now,NOT
the girly father is wearing a pink shirt,NOT
everyone is complaining about how she only eats a plant based diet and how she isnt vegan guys give her time and let her figure everything out its a big step in the right direction,NOT
oh no baby what is u doing,NOT
i totally understand that you feel you are a woman inside and you have the right to express that but you have to be honest with yourself you were born with physical advantages that clearly set you apart from cis women,NOT
i will never understand why this has been so politicized,NOT
trans people should only compete against other trans people that would be fair,NOT
if a woman doesnt like the idea of taking the time and energy and making the sacrifices to raise her own kids why have them if it happens anyway there are so many couples would happily take and raise them that there is no problem there but if she has bought into the idea that she must have it all or else she must resent all men and if making as much or more money as her husband is more important then pay someone else to raise them  or me and i mention the husband because the video does daycare workers will never love or treat those children like their own and they come and go so the sense of abandonment starts young and telling them they shouldnt feel it is about the adults feelings not theirs ever heard the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world in case you need that spelled out it means that the person who spends the most time with and talking toguiding children is the one who actually raises them not the one who simply houses them pays the bills eats dinner with them  if even that and gives the biggest gifts he or she develops the closest relationship and passes on their values and beliefs and thus naturally has the greatest influence on what the kids will do with their lives  thus that person becomes the hand im old enough to have seen many many outcomes of both ways and theres no going back or doovers and no amount of sorrys change things so we made the choice to be the ones to love and raise ours and id be that hand who was there knowing the financial challenges and i am so glad we did it was worth every struggle and thats what i tell them  you are worth more than any amount of money i could have made yes kids raised by others usually still love their parents but when talking with them many wistfully and with repressed guilt say they wish they could have had something like what we did for ours but that theyd never tell their mom because it would just make her feel bad so they carry the painful burden quietly kids have enough pain in this world so why add to it if its for a point of pride for the philosophy a choice to be financially richer and have more stuff  at their expense my boss and coworkers would not remember me long after i am gone would not likely be there for me when i am old and feeble and need help or visit me regularly if i am in hospital send cards call or text or put flowers on my grave id never imagine being a stereotypical passiveaggressive guilt mom who overtly or subtly makes them feel bad for holding me back and being the reason i couldnt achieve my feminist dream whoa nice thing to pass onto your kids eh oh and if this guilttrips you at least you are an adult and can handle it better than a child,NOT
thats a bit misleading the qiestion is why do works that are predominantly female pay worse wages the awnser to that is the institutional sexism inherent to the capitalist mod of production,NOT
of course thats how it works blaire we live in lala land now take off that makeup and have a wank you silly boy,NOT
itll push you too run faster the body cant run faster come on man its so unfair this is a disgrace,NOT
i cant wait for womens boxing ufc etc should be a hoot,NOT
yeah i think trisha just enjoyed looking like a male and now has tricked herself into thinking that must mean she isnt a female anymore maybe she is scared to be a tom boy because she has always been girly but honestly who cares its your life dress how you want no matter what gender you are,NOT
its an earnings gap ughhhhhhh,NOT
tldw women earn less money than men because they work fewer hours,NOT
make sure to get alot of protein you dont need meat for protein,NOT
really that is so great however it is way easier to go vegetarian and slowly become a vegan when you are ready a lot of people i know try to go strait to vegan and it is too much for them i was vegetarian first and slowly gave up milk eggs and other byproducts good luck,NOT
disgusting allowing this to happen they are men not women,ABU
but i thought men and women were equal and theres no difference,NOT
wow a video that states moreof the facts,NOT
also im pregnant so i dont want to work a lot so im mad because im not making as much as my male coworkers because they are still working  hours instead of my sad  hours i need the same pay amount as they do even though i work less thats what you dumb ass women sound like  use your brains not your gender to be logical,NOT
if you got balls u r a boymale,NOT
almost everyone is being so mean in these comments and i dont get it i totally support you trish i would recommend you checking out mommytang and high carb hannahs videos as well because mommytang eats lots of greens and hannah eats tons of starches and they eat very simple i know you dont like lettuce so you could try putting a bunch of greens in a smoothie along with some bananas maybe to drown out the taste of the greens having  or  fruit monomeals is great too just dont starve yourself good luck,NOT
in reality the wage gap isnt a problem and is nonexistent,NOT
thanks klaus nice work,NOT
if you need any help watch lauren toyota and hot for food honestly amazing for vegan recipe and is more realistic than most vegan goals,NOT
im not vegan but i actually have a brain and know its good for our bodies and the planet and i do not make fun of it i hate the people who think they are smart and make fun of veganism and boast of how they can eat meat their brain and opinions are stuck in  i hope i can be vegan some day,NOT
the year i went vegan and became an activist ,NOT
the language u use to describe relationships with trans people is really problematic i believe u when you say you are trans but please learn some more things and try to not just talk about this stuff in an improvised fashion a lot of your gender theory is based around traditional gender roles which is exactly what being trans is not about look into genderfluid and genderqueer identities please talk to more trans people,NOT
i dont believe it lol,NOT
i love you trish go vegan ,NOT
the whole thing about the wage gap is that its talking about averages to examine an actual salary gap you have to look at it in specific fields not across all mediums because its very clear that if you just average out yearly earnings and divide one by the other youre going to get a very general image of reality the truth is while men have been encouraged to pursue wealth and success for themselves for decades if not centuries the same incentive wasnt true for women at least for a long time if not still and because of that many more women turn out to be stayathome parents or settle for small jobs less women in stem fields less women in big businesses less women in big roles not only because of a structurally sexist academic and professional universe but also because of it im sure there would be some difference most likely very significant if you were to compare a man and a woman in similar roles within the same company or across an entire field of work but it probably wouldnt be as latent as the wage gap weve grown accustomed to,NOT
laura bars are vegan great snack and beans are awesome get some black bean burgers that and sweet potato fries yum,NOT
search up hot for food they have the best recipes,NOT
hey trish u said u went vegetarian when u were  ur body was still growing and changing so i dont think its a good representation of what this diet will do to ur boby dont be scared u can do it it just takes alot of will power,NOT
i genuinely hope so much that this isnt a joke this would be amazing,NOT
im sorry trish i love you but i dont think you will succeed i really hope you do dont get me wrong but it wouldnt be the first time you started a dietworkout regimen and gave up after less than a week,NOT
ive noticed that its muscle memory to like your videos right away not even mad because i agree with you everytime,NOT
even im not crazy enough to go vegan lol,ABU
i always thought the wage gap was a bit dubious,NOT
check out mindovermunch and blogilates mindovermunch has a lot of vegan recipes and meal prep,NOT
i wish i could thumbs up this video  million times,NOT
awesome girl  i know you can do it i know it can seem hard in the beginning but as time goes by it becomes the most natural thing to do  you will realise how easy it actually is to be vegan these days with all amazing options and youll also feel better and better the longer you stay with the lifestyle  remember you have all support in the world ,NOT
you can eat whatever you want being vegan however this is when eating fruits and veg and potatoes if you eat vegan junk food then its not going to make you lose weight just eat when you are hungry and stop when you are full,NOT
in my sociology class we were talking about gender inequality and my professor brought up the wage gap i asked why wouldnt businesses hire women in order for them to pay less and make more profit he answered in some bs that people at the top are sexist and thats the reason why all i ask for is one conservative professor just one,NOT
yess freelee you are so beautiful  inspirational,NOT
awesome video and hey you would look super beautiful if you grew your hair now too but you can get better love you ,NOT
wasnt this filmed like a month ago before shanes movie,NOT

this is wrong you cant make money when your major is gender studies,NOT
that vegan couple made a video for you that has lots of helpful tips please watch,NOT
this video is pure gold and statistically more men work around the clock  hours a day to create provide for and protect us all everything that cant close or stop for a minute statistically more men pilots truckers trains ships surgeons cops firemen factory work soldiers engineers tradesmen fbi cia large farms and ranches utilities like water treatment plants infastructure work oil field work etcetera it brings a tear to my female eye much respect for both sexes out there that are actually making good things happen and actually contributing i wish videos like these could replace commercials,NOT
is this the same about australia,NOT
i need some fried chicken,NOT
i understand what trisha was saying about the chickens the next time i ate chicken after seeing that video i felt so disgusting and guilty i have been vegetarian for about five months now my only downfalls from being vegan are cheese and ice cream but next time i go to the store i am going to look for vegan ice cream thank you for playing that video so much in your videos the first couple of times i just looked away but now i know that if i cant watch it i shouldnt be eating it,NOT
wooo trish this is so great c ,NOT

trisha does this stuff so that people can talk about her and keep her relevant ,NOT
title there is no gender wage gap script a study shows that the actual wage gap is  makes perfect sense,NOT
true there are many variables that account for wage gap but in some cases like in certain countries wage gap is real for the same work and the same time in some cases women are paid less than men in some cases men are paid less than women too,NOT
trisha films her videos in advanced she could have made this video three weeks ago and already ate vegan foods like she said in the video for two weeks,NOT
someone told me that soy can make youre hormones go crazy does anyone know if thats true,NOT
just remember that going vegan does not make you toned it will help you lose fat but if you want to be fit you have to exercise freelee is a very active person so thats why shes in such great shape good luck to you though and i hope you stay motivated i just finished up my vegan new years resolution goal this past month and it is not easy at all and i mean no meat no cheese no dairy no sodas or processed sugar probably the hardest thing ive ever done but very rewarding and i lost  lbs in just a few months  so again good luck its not always important that you succeed indefinitely but that your at least giving an honest effort,NOT
am  years old and live in texas i live in a household of meat eaters and i personally ive been pescatarian for about  to  months i recently made the switch to vegetarianism and i really really really really really really really really really really want to be vegan i couldve made the switch instantly a yr ago to plant based but it wouldve been too hard on my family which is whats keeping me from it now it is tough considering my family torments criticizes and teases me about my lifestyle choices my family is proud and supportive of me even if it may seem otherwise and helps me afford tofu extra produce and etc along with monthly doctoral check ups since i am an avid athlete both in volleyball and school sports i try to cut out dairy whenever i possibly can i substitute milks cheeses yogurts and etc for the plantbased versions and it is more accessible considering my mom is dairy intolerant so i practically am vegan i am very mature for my age and try toeducate myself on the topic pretty regularly i have seen all documentaries i know of on pbn netflix and a surplus on youtube i dont think my family fully grasps the logistics of veganism i have tried numerous times to get my family to watch documentaries with me but repeatedly have been bombarded with nos and attacks on my lifestyle choices when in reality all im trying to do is to help educate and inform my family about their daily choices and to help them understand my perspective my dad has made numerous comments saying you only eat grass or you need to actually do research when all my dad has done is listened to a few podcasts of biased farmers i eventually tracked my mom into watching the game changers with me on netflix by telling her it was a documentary based on athletes which is partially true but it ended up practically pointless because she fell asleep  minutes into the movie i have tried numerous times since then to have her watch some with me but and i quote  i dont want to watch cute little animals die as an answer which proves she knows what she does on an everyday basis is morally environmentally ethically and for health reasons is wrong it frustrates the crap out of me for goodness sake shes freaking dietitian especially for diabetes which is caused by oh you guessed it the saturated fat and cholesterol is animal products ughhhhhhhhhhh please help me what can i do any suggestions to help me convince my parents my point of view to watch a documentary anything pleaseeeeeeeeeeee oh ps pbn i was literally waiting for so long for this documentary to come out and when i saw it in my suggestionshome page i said skrew sleep im watching this lol,NOT

typo eating not ratting,NOT
just because you dress up as a male from a musical does not make you transgender also i wouldnt refer to anything or anyone as girly because thats not really the correct term id say feminine and yes trisha is very feminine and presents feminine identifying with males is a totally different thing identifying as a male is a whole nother thing my question is if you are an adult now and can do what you want then why are you not attempting to somewhat pass another thing is because you are a straight female you are going to be attracted to gay dudes because you are straight that does not make you trans because theyre gay you have to have this thing called gender dysphoria something that all trans people have and you wouldnt definitely not even want to mention your chest if you actually had it because its a very overwhelming topic for transgender people i should now because i am trans and also your gender identity and sexuality is not a choice just like the natural color of your eyes and skin you didnt choose that,NOT

i actually have a personal story that could shed some light on the unexplained wage gap after calculations my mother was the gm of an advertising company and she had many agents working under but two stood out they both worked the same amount of hours and overtime they both had the same quality of work and had similar qualifications and contracts and one was a man the other a woman and they had both been working around a year and a half one day the woman discovered that the man mad about  percent more than her though they had the same position and bonuses when she came to my mother and asked about it she learned it wasnt because of sexism it was very simple the man asked for a raise and got it my mother admitted to the woman that if she had asked for a raise she would have gotten one but because she didnt the guy made more than her on his base salary this is very common in certain fields because men on average have more confidence in the workplace as such they have around a x more likelihood of asking for a raise or bonus the woman asked for it and she got it and when my mother was later promoted to senior vp of marketing the man got a promotion to gm why you may ask because he asked for the promotion first and my mother gave it to him as he was a member of the top  agents along with the woman the morale of the story is that this smaller wage gap can be explained in certain situations by workplace confidence it is your job to ask for a raise or promotion and not the employer to ask if you want one because confidence and decisiveness in the workplace can trump credentials almost  of the time i hope you can all learn from the womans mistake and use it forward in your career,NOT
do people still watch trisha maybe she lost some viewers and need some attention i wonder if shes serious or if this is her weird humour i hope shes not serious,NOT
this bitch is nuts,ABU

there is no such thing as eating too much on a vegan diet unless it is fat but it is a good tip if you want to lose weight is to at least eat a day but if you can maybe  but i dont know your bmi so i probably should stay out of that but please dont under eat it will make you gain weight and itll just make things worse also buy more fruit if you like smoothies buy a lot of fruit to put into smoothies its a good way to get all of your calories in and for me i love pasta vegan korean food vegan chinese food i can give you so many recipes you should watch mommy tang she does vegan mukbang,NOT

feminists sees video comments well obviously she is just a fake women and is a man in disguise,NOT
but on your snapchat you just posted you eating sour cream and onion chips which contains milk so i dont know when you are actually doing this but just an fyi sour cream and onion chips contain milk,NOT
it wont last if you dont eat enough listen you have abused your body for years by going on these crash diets that means you have something called metabolic damage in the beginning freele gained weight as a vegan because her body wasnt used to that much food so yeah you will gain weight in the beginning but once your body has had time to heal youll lose fat not weight but fat and that can take some time maybe a year so if you think vegansim is the solution to lose weight before your music video youre wrong i still hope youll go vegan bc vegansim is the long term solution to weightloss and you will never have to crash diet ever again  i just hope you are not going to starve yourself in order to lose weight go crazy bc of the lack of nutrients and then blame vegansim like the balanced blond did,NOT
did you ever go back and confront her on why she didnt keep up with the change,NOT

this issue will never resolve it self family life would have to reshape and women would have to see their time with children or their selves reduce to even out the numbers with men working full or part time women would have to value their time at work as much or more so than their social or family existence and firefighter is never going to be a flexible job for someone who isnt invested fully in it lots of things will never likely bend that much to an employees needs,NOT
the video buzzfeed would never be balsy enough to make,NOT
this is facts,NOT
lol    i love outrage culture someone is watching this losing their mind in anger despite the truth,NOT
hold the phone imma blow your mind if there was no wage gap does this mean women are now being paid more than men,NOT
the most likely reason the current wage gap exists is because women tend to be the dominant caretaker of children thus having less flexible schedules,NOT
why doesnt she just say shes gender neutral tbh shes still finding her self so lay off her yeah her video tittle wasnt cool but she is lost and wants to find her way on who she is,NOT
unfair period its ok to identify as a women but at the end of the day they are physically boys i would not allow my daughter to compete with them period not because they are transgender simply because like you heard on the video doctors do not even know exactly how the hormones are affecting their bodies its sad that those girls who trained hard and work hard to get to that point and  they were cheated period we just live in world that allows people to make whatever decisions they want and they want to be treat the same as everyone else but in this cases they are not like most regular girl they have an unfair advantage i bet if it was a more physical sport that like wrestling or soccer everyone would feel differently cause people would be able to see the obvious difference and advantage and strength and some case size i mean i get it we want them to feel normal but did anyone think the girls are being robbed of a experience as well,NOT
it always makes me laugh how many youtube commenters think they came up with some factors that a group of people who run scientific studies for a living did not think of,NOT

what about the gender mandatory military service gap all around the worldevery time i bring up this gapwomen inmediately go to the obviously biological differences  reasoning of course men and women are different so they are ready to accept biological differences to explain the male only mandatory military service in places like my home country of cuba they accept that men are stronger that women have the burden of childbearing and all the limitations that come with it so of course they will be exempt from military service but then suddenly when it comes to explain differences in pay none of the previously mentioned reasons matter and it must be discrimination because patriarchy,NOT

this video is right every social scientist and average citiezen knows that men a women have diferent choices however women are educated to perform service jobs while men are educated to perform leadership and scientific jobs boys are expected to be good at math while girls are expected to be good at cooking and take care of childrens a single father can not be on guard  but that is statistically irrelevant because they are the minority most single parents are mothers there is a gender gap thats why there is a wage gap its not magic the worst thing is that this gender gap is harmful for women who want to be professionally and economically independent as well as for men tired of gold diggers i recognize the ability to use data but this conservative propaganda does nothing but misinform people taking into account the decadent educational system to be a first world country that you have there in the united states with fancy titles and lousy argumentation,NOT

yay trisha finally i recommend vega protein powder  use almond milk i also love this app called yummly you can look up vegan recipes i like morning star or gardein for like little snacks through out the day or for dinner i also recommend yoplait yogurts because they do offer you calcium and protein or you can eat mixed nuts or dried fruit because those will also offer you protein garbanzo beans quinoa and couscous are awesome sides to have for any meal because they are super high in protein and for me i eat tofu quite often bc its tasteless so you can use any sauce on it and itll only taste like the sauce but the texture is like scrambled eggs its super easy once you get the taste of all the awesome vegan foods you wont want to go back to eating meet ,NOT

hey im a vegetarian but most of the time in practically vegan i eat dairy maybe twice a week or so and i looovee vegan food because you can get socreative with it its really hard for many people to transition especially whn youre a meat fan and stuff you were asking about other foods besides fruit that you can have on a vegan diet and i can give you some ideas whicha re totally delicious and most people who eat meat love these as well and dont realize they are eating a vegan meal when they eat these pasta prepared vegan in a million ways bread whole wheat is so much better for youre health and physique sorbet this is a great replacement for ice cream vegan icecream yup there is vegan ice cream made with vegan milks that taste just as good rice you can make veggiefried rice vegetable curry my personal favorite quinoa which is an amazing and super delicious protein packed meal it can be prepared in different ways as well cold hot peanut butter make sure to get all natural or make your own at home by blending roasted peanuts w no salt dont add water almond rice soy milk frappucinos with soymilk putting caps so you know you can still drink those fraps girl just ask for soy milk or rice milk nuts walnuts peanuts pistachios almonds these are great protein packed snacks they also have healthy fats cereals check the package says vegan and low sugar is the best option vegan cheese almond cheese resembles mozzarella vegan yogurt made with almond or coconut milk acai bowls papaya bowls with no yogurt pitaya bowls hummus great for snacking with crackers carrots celery cucumber etc mashed potatoes broccoli cauliflower etc with no cream oatmeal cna be prepared in so many delicious ways use almond coconut or rice milk or water so this is all that i could think of at the moment i really hope you can get back on track with veganism because its not only great for you but also for the environment my recommendation is checking out some vegan restaurants near where you live do so through yelp or google it so you can see how many different delicious options are placed on the menu and maybe you can get some ideas to cook yourself at home believe me veganism is great and fruit is not the only option you have for food and what i love the most about it is that you can get so creative with everything quick heads up marshmallows gelatine and gum are made with grenetine which comes from animal bone marrow not vegan of course and quite disgusting but there are vegan marshmallows which actually taste pretty good vanillaish and theres vegan chewing gum as well there are infinite vegan desserts that you can make too its all about looking for recipes online unless you are the most creative person on earth at the kitchen i hope this helps a lot and i hope that you can last as a vegan now knowing that fruit isnt the only thing we eat haha,NOT
this video didnt really prove a point or make any points at all out of the men and women who took that business degree the men probably would have gone on to take jobs such as a stockbroker or a corporate investment banker while the women would have taken more casual jobs such as supply chain managers why because they choose to on average most women just arent up to working the same hours as men wether or not they have kids to look after women also get sick more than men what most feminists dont know is that it is completely illegal for a boss to pay two workers differently for the same job but is it the same job at the mcdonalds i work at the male workers keep the shop running while the female workers mostly talk and take really lengthy bathroom breaks this video also didnt consider that even after the test subjects completed their business degrees not all of them would have gone on to work careers in business the video just said the income they are making why feminist news sources like buzzfeed and the abc keep making these type of videos is completely beyond me all the comments are negative,NOT
im new to your channel ive just subscribed damn youre beautiful much love from england,NOT
ok but this is acting like women doing a majority of work in raising a child is an insurmountable problem,NOT

i get why people feel confused and reacted in this case but i dont think its right for people to say toabout someone what they are or are not,NOT
why dont they want to compete against the boys there are hardly ever any restrictions that say girls cant compete against the boys if they can qualify this is a stupid as it gets the end result will be  transgender women dominating womens sports and then everyone will just lose interest if you are a girl why would you do all that training when you know you have to compete against a boy with long hair you cant win not even on a good day so you drop out this is the end of female sports but i think it will be a good thing because it highlights how stupid the whole argument is if you want to wear a dress that is fine but the dress isnt what makes you a woman in the same way a suit doesnt make you a man those things are just clothes and makeup somehow we are now confusing clothes and hairstyles and makeup for gender identity its absolutely ridiculous skirts never made a woman a woman and they cant make a man a woman either i think its all a devious plot to steal scholarships how progressive is that weve actually found a way as devious as it is to give scholarships that were meant for women to men this whole thing is absolutely sick i cant believe that any women especially feminists support this in any way ive seen how soccer clubs handle it and they will let the girls who qualify play on the boys team if they have no place else to put them that matches their ability but boys on a girls team absolutely unheard of and it doesnt matter how you self identify penis boys so we can make this a lot simpler until your penis and nut sack have been removed you are a boy your hair doesnt matter and neither does your skirt the scottish men have been wearing skirts for years they call them kilts but you dont see anyone accuse them of being girls because they are wearing a skirt kilt and trust me you wouldnt want to unless you are really good at fighting the scottish kilt does not transform the angry fighting man into a docile woman dont mess with him or he will mess horribly with you kilt or not,NOT

prageru is not a university it is a media organisation im not being hyperbolic it literally isnt a tertiary education institution and notice how the presenter didnt actually name any of the studies cited the first was referred to as a study by the american association of university women and the second was a nameless paper by the us department of labor a reluctance to name or link to studies in the description usually points towards cherrypicking information that suits your argument i dont know very much about gender pay disparity but im going to look for a more reliable source to help me figure it out,NOT
trisha no delete this,NOT
i believe you may have misunderstood the argument the argument is not that there is a literal gap in which at the same job post women are paid less than men it is that systematically women are prevented or discouraged from obtaining higher paid work for a number of different reasons men are seen as more powerful wise and omniscient women are more likely to be the primary caregiver to their children women are more often than not disrespected in positions of authority because of mans insecurity etc,NOT
this is exactly what i support equalism not feminazism,NOT

to those who think its fake this audience isnt going to be responsive to your ideas go throw your privilege around somewhere else,NOT
i dont think its all that nicedignified of you to in the same video even ask for acceptance and love and then put others in that same community down what with your whole not wanting to label yourself as theythem because people will think theyre right about you being schizophrenic not only is that incredibly discouraging and insulting to nonbinarygenderfluid trans people its a giant f u to people living with schizophrenia i can only imagine its hard enough coping with hearing and seeing things but imagine using a huge platform to validate unfair negativity toward them smh,NOT
feminists may believe women make  less then men but really feminist are just  stupider than the average person,ABU
but why do women make different choices also dont diss people just cuz you think theyre wrong like you did at the end of the video,NOT
how about we end all affirmative acton so employers know that they are getting the real deal and not a dunce who got a leg up then lets begin a huge public shaming campaign for women who fail to earn enough maybe we can tattoo deadbeat or loser across their forehead lets have a media campaign talking about how a woman who cant support  kids and a husband without him having to work isnt a real woman lets saddle women with all the responsibility for supporting the family or face being branded losers not worthy of life lets make it so a woman has to earn a certain amount to qualify for any consideration at all for romance yep lets reduce the entire worth of women to their paycheck then lets see if that old pay gap doesnt vanish faster than a candy bar at a fat camp,ABU

we also need to fix the workplace death gap the lifespan gap the suicide gap the alimony gap the child support gap the child custody gap the hours worked gap,NOT
 you have to remember femenists dont have common sense,ABU
the wages are always payed per hour so this whole women work less has no significance in this debate the point is you should pay women and men equal amounts per  hour for performing on the same tasks with same responsabilities its that simple so many of these arguments are complete nonsense extreme feminism is very damaging i agree but so is this wisely covered up antifeminism,NOT
wives make  cents for every husbands dollar wife then takes husbands dollar,NOT
when evidence contradicts your theory  your theory is wrong as the video acknowledges  there is a pay gap an australian study of over  occupations showed that women earn more than men in only one highpaying job in australia and that women only out earned men in jobs that were low paid anyway data from australian tax office as the australian study found  there is no such thing as a job where women are taking home large pay packets but men are not the median income for jobs favouring men was up to eleven times higher than the median income for jobs favouring women and it does make a fundamentally flawed assumption  that corporations do the hiring they dont individual managers make hiring decisions  and rarely are their incentives aligned with corporate objectives a corporation may claim equality but individual managers have to handle staff absences when women are off having children  consciously and sub consciously there is an incentive to hire and promote men  and thus pay women less to discourage them from accepting a role the final flawed logic is that we cant explain why there is a discrepancy therefore we cant claim that there is one the claim was that women were paid less  and the data shows that this is true  whether or not one can explain the reason if police used that logic they would never investigate murders because they cant explain how it happened therefore they cant be certain that it did happen,NOT
good for women for majoring in lower paying categories they make those sacrifices to become psychologists teachers and social workers to support young people and their communities ,NOT

larabars theyre super yummy and theyre nice to have as a quick snack through the day when youre feeling peckish i love eating rice with some potatoes and onions and other stuff but going vegan is all about getting creative with your meals the meat and dairy industry is so huge that it makes it nearly impossible to just go to the store  be able to grab some food without worrying if its vegan or not whole foods will be your best friend pasta is yummy and sooo filling potatoes rice and beans are always great just be careful when i started out vegan i got the same advice but for some reason i never thought to add anything in to my food to make it taste better so more often than not i was sitting there eating plain rice and getting full but hating what i was eating imagine if you just cooked a burger patty but didnt add any spices or literally anything at all to it and just ate the cooked ground beef not yummy same applies to vegan food if you dont spice it up pun intended itll definitely make you start to resent going vegan i recommend following lots of twitterinstagrampinterestyoutube accounts that are vegan so you can stay motivated and find new tasty recipes i know im not the only one whos obsessed with those buzzfeed cooking videos so its the same concept you see something tasty you want it just make sure its vegan good luck girl you might get discouraged at times but thats completely natural keep your end goal in sight stay positive and love yourself you can do it ,NOT

i personally competed against terry miller and andraya yearwood and i have noproblem with the idea of them winning the races that they compete in if they identify as a girl then let them compete as one if most of the female student body is acceptant of these very talented girls than the parents shouldnt have a problem they are not the ones racing on that  lane track if anything terry and andraya push the rest of the girls to work harder in order to beat them in a race,NOT

ive been a vegan for about  years now and im just gonna tell you it takes a lot of fucking patience the first month is gonna be like hell you have no idea what to eat and youre gonna feel like shot sometimes but after that its pretty damn awesome ive lost like kg and i can gain and lose weight pretty easily if i eat the right stuff unfortunately i love fried shit my tips are that you should start with being a vegetarian and eating less meat if you cut out all meat and shit like that at once youre just gonna binge on it later what me and a lot of my friends did then you should eat grains and beans so you get stuffed and get used to the calories oh and dont forget the bananas you better eat a lot of them the biggest mistake i probably made was threat i didnt really explore so much i basically ate the same things everyday and got bored so try out new things as often as you can it helped me lose the weight a lot faster too  i have no idea why love you,NOT
scrambled tofu on toast with fried mushrooms is a great substitute for scrambled eggs makes a really good breakfast,NOT

jason nash turned trisha into a male x,NOT
its nice that this video marshals research for evidence but unfortunately its very selective and biased most glaringly the argument ignores decades of research which has looked into the role of gender and negotiation in perpetuating the wagegap on average for example women are less likely to initiate negotiations for their salaries less likely to counteroffer and more likely to make greater concessions and while this is a choice it does not follow as the video tries to claim that preference and sexism are incompatible on the contrary what the research shows is that when women negotiate assertively on their own behalf they are perceived as acting in a stereotypically incongruent manner ie not relationship oriented and are therefore viewed negatively by their counterpart in other words women have to face a tradeoff between power and likeability that men do not have to deal with which is kinda of like the definition of sexism as a result in a conscious and strategic effort to avoid social backlash  to dodge being perceived as pushy or nasty  women tend to either avoid negotiations all together or be less competitive hence they get less over the course of a career these numbers really add up fascinatingly the negotiation gendergap all but disappears when women are asked to negotiate on behalf of others they are more comfortable being aggressive and are less likely to be judged harshly for doing so as women who negotiate on behalf of others are not violating a stereotype yet this representation approach tends to put a lot of people in a difficult bind perpetuate a stereotype or wait till the system is transformed,NOT
can i just say this is the type of behavior people like you and kalvin have been calling out for years from less known people but now all of a sudden people agree when trisha the queen of trolling does it hopefully this makes people open their eyes,NOT
been vegan for almost  years  wont go back ,NOT
angela should be in more videos,NOT
title there is no gender wage gap  the wage gap is  huh it is very true that many people use the  wage gap number without any nuance or detail and that number is misleading to the point of being wrong but arguing against the weakest version of your opponents argument is not very impressive the better informed concerns over the wage gap focus on career choices particularly at universities its true that better paying college degrees are pursued disproportionately by men and this video simply states it and moves on this is the heart of the question though so why do men pursue these degrees at higher rates then women are parents teachers others in society subconsciously steering girls away from the boring nerdy stuff is this a case of the soft bigotry of low expectations do inschool and afterschool programs that teach extracurricular like cad programming electronics etc lean towards recruiting boys instead of girls are the teachers of these programs disproportionately men resulting in more role models for boys than for girls does networking through alumni favor male grads because most of the alumni in wellpaying fields are alumni creating a kind of inertia that subconsciously favors male over female grads does society place far more pressure on women to marry younger and raise kids leading couples to split childrearing duties unevenly and slowing done womens careers concerns about the gender gap are commonly dismissed as nothing more than a pipeline problem there are certainly feminists who want to make more out of this than simply a pipeline problem but a pipeline problem is still a problem and in my opinion a substantial one at that realists who want to solve this problem are trying to make schools parents and society as a whole aware with the hope that girls feel like stem degrees are a choice for them but this video it breaks the  gap down just enough to get to the answer its looking for but not enough to acknowledge or delve into the heart of the question this video leads one to think that theres no problem here the reality is that a deeper understanding of the issue requires finding answers to the questions i outlined above deciding if those answers reveal problems that need to be fixed and taking action as needed,NOT
how can a woman who was born a woman think to identify as a male or is a female that because she relates more with males identifies as a male i enjoy some of your videos but this is one that no offense confuses the living shit out of me for the life of me i cannot understand how or why you think your transgender and this video does not explain your thoughts very well at all you cannot be a transgender male and a natural born female that identifies as her natural self its just not how it works,NOT
like the video but annoying af accent,NOT
yuuuuuus girl good job,NOT
i reported this video it is much to misogynistic this is evil and i demand it be taken down,NOT
how did these guys get k from a business degree ,NOT
i really want to go vegan but my parents wont let me and i try to avoid animal products as much as i can because every time i eat animal products i feel like im gonna vomit ,NOT

i know im gonna sound like a complete idiot to all the people who believe this video but youre just basing everything on a video that has no sources to what theyre saying and people say that all the butthurt feminists disliked this let me just clarify im a male not trans bi gay or anything like that before im gonna hear any excuse on why im wrong for being a feminist that wants more than just equality one point that i see is not very believable is that it has to do with career choices im pretty sure no matter the career choice a person makes there is always a man at that job that you can compare the money gap in unless were talking about strippers those are separated if they just based it on all women then yes of course the money amount would be less but its not about the career choice its about the money that a man and woman makes on the same job not on the career choice of both genders some countries the wage gap is almost not even there but ive had this explained by people who arent females just say im making this shit up for all i care i just want to get my statement across,NOT
we cant use steroids in sport because more testosterone equals a big advantage so taking a dude with reduced testosterone vs women with basically nonexistent testosterone is as much of an advantage as a dude on testosterone steroids racing against non steroid runners its not about identity its about being fair to all of the runners you want to be a woman good for you but if youre saying you have no advantage youre disturbed now im about as non athletic as a skinny dude can be but back in senior year during that pacer test i got to  laps and only stopped because i was running in vans terrible shoes for running and me feel were hurting the rest of the dudes say for one xxl member of the class got at least  laps while the girls were averaging around  with only four making it past  and thats just endurance were talking about we had a girl who ran track  different years who reached  or  and my video game clad self out lasted her there is an advantage to testosterone fellas its may not be fair but it is indeed a fact but what do i know im just your average dude ,ABU
sheaps what can i say,NOT
s feminists women are just as capable as men why shouldnt we be able to work s feminists you need to change the way we work so that it women can get paid as much,NOT
smartlife smart patties so good just like a burger if you want to feel like youre eating what you used to eat the fake meats  potatoes  things that are startchy theyre filling high carb and so satisfying,NOT
i never got the appeal why do we glamorize people who behave in her fashion not only on this topic but in general,NOT
love the info the constant background music competing for that information not so much,NOT
she says choices create the difference not the wage gap but arent choices created by the gap in education in the fact that women are often forced to work in lesspaid sectors that women more often take care of children and thus spend less time at work this gap is not a myth,NOT
lol why is this a question they know step up,NOT
fuck you bitch your daughter lost,ABU

damn i though i was going to be able to tear some hippie liberal bullshit apart after watching this video but you proved me wrong this video is extremely fair and balanced unlike most other vox videos hopefully they will stick to videos following this format and not regress,NOT
i love tofu,NOT
yes i said that i was lesbian and people replied with i thought you were trans ok what does my sexuality have to do with my gender a whole dramasituation came around for weeks i was so embarrassed because nobody supported me therefore months later that same person who argued with me reposted something onto their instagram story of transitions cost around k k but someone who hasnt had one yet costs  dollars to respect if it costs  dollars for no transitions and surgeries why cant you respect me,NOT
you can do it trish i love you and support you,NOT
thank god someone stating their sources in the description,NOT
watch mommy tangshe has lots of good recipe ideas,NOT
i commend vox for making these kind of vids in spite of how sexist the youtube communitycomment section can be sometimes and dealing with the sexist backlash,NOT
she is about as trans as my straight basic bitch white self is  i literally hate people like her because it does create this mockery of people i know who have goneare going through the struggles of transitioning and it just sucks that shes profiting off of it why is the internet not flipping out over this,NOT
its also okay not to put a label on your diet if this doesnt work out instead of saying shit ill start tomorrow that had dairy or i ate meat by mistake guess thats it its not about winning an award for the longest streak of no meat or dairy its about making healthier choices i cut out red meat like  or  years ago and yes ive had a few slip ups by accident but honestly my body is so much healthier and happier when im fueling it right so dont worry about a specific label of vegan or vegetarian live in the moment eat what makes your body feel good and that will make all the difference,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that its fake,NOT
trish i cant see you going vegan for ever you love your mcdonalds taco bell and everything else lol,NOT
if its true why dont employers just get female workers come on cant you see your wrong death to feminazis,ABU
trish where are the carbs pasta potatoes rice etc,NOT
on the one hand i have had a change of perspective on the youre not trans thing deciding for ourselves whether someone is and isnt trans opens the door for actual bigots to be cunts to trans people just because its kind of a lesson we shouldve learned with riley at the same time if you actually say youre not trans like trisha did youre not,NOT
i think leaders within the trans community should have a voice and lead the discussion along with everyone the two girls shouldnt feel excluded but also the rest of the other girls shouldnt have to be at a disadvantage like this this is the question of sex and gender those identifications should be discussed,NOT
this is actually an interesting conversation on gender just because she doesnt have all the correct words doesnt make it crazy,NOT

eat bugs they are delis they have a protein,NOT
trish this is so great i myself come from a very eatingdisordered past for years i alternated between extreme starvation and hardcore binge eating which eventually just turned to binge eating all the time food became the central part of my life my entire life was planned around food and once i would binge it would be like oh well i guess that was the whole point of today anything else i do today is pointless may as well just go to bed this all changed when i went vegan here are my tips  eat as many whole foods as you can if a fruit smoothie isnt satisfying enough for you in the morning add lots of hemp seeds and almondcashew butter and chia seeds those will give you healthy fats and fiber increase your calorie intake and just make you feel fuller and give you a better start to your day another important ingredient for smoothies for increased energy and nutrition maca powder it makes your smoothie taste like fucking malt balls mmmm  stock up on emergency foods that are high in calories and easy to make or dont require any preparation at all like frozen burgers burritos pizzas but also just nuts and seeds these will be your best friend when you dont have time and you need to eat something its good to snack on nuts or dried fruit throughout the day to keep yourself from getting hungry later in the day and then bingeing on something terrible  try to throw as many greens into your food as possible you will eventually grow to crave them and this is coming from someone who was obsessed with bacon and cheese and was disgusted with vegetables lol i now crave spinach arugula and kale we humans are creatures of habit you can literally train yourself to crave healthy foods even if you cant stop eating the bad ones lol its best to sneak greens into a fruit smoothie especially one with really sweet fruits like mango or pineapple because then you cant even taste them  just google things like easy vegan recipes or vegan comfort food and bookmark a bunch of them for future reference get earth balance vegan mac  cheese but when you prepare it with a plant milk of your choice  earth balance vegan butter  although its fine without the butter honestly add like  tablespoons of nutritional yeast you can get it at whole foods for an extra cheesy flavor also look up recipes for tempeh bacon  you can make bacon mac  cheese with that shit soooo good there are so many great products out there obviously the best healthiest way to eat vegan especially for weight loss is to stick to eating as many whole foods as you can make everything from scratch etc for instance if you have a good blender you can make your own mac  cheese from soaked raw unsalted cashews and sweet potatoes and nutritional yeast and lots of spices or alfredo from soaked cashews and cauliflower and nutritional yeast but there are so many great products to buy and keep in your freezer its good to have them on hand for when you have no time and youre craving something savory and meaty if you dont have those products as a backup you might end up bingeing on something nonvegan and then feeling shitty about yourself although with all the vegan options at taco bell chipotle various pizza places wendys etc you can still get tasty vegan fast food try beyond meat and field roast meat alternatives theyre so fucking good there are amazing nuggets at whole foods in the frozen food section i think theyre by that whole foods brand  or whatever its called take it from me a person who used to binge like crazy and was only happy when i could eat tons of bacon and cheese and pasta with cream sauce and burgers and steaks i couldnt imagine going vegan until i watched a few documentaries and freelees videos too and decided to just fucking go for it it saved my life and now i dont even eat that healthy all the time i like meat alternatives i like frying stuff in oil etc but im still thin and looking good and i dont exercise even when i smoke pot and binge which happens often lol my weight stays the same because its all plant foods rich in fiber good luck you can do it ,NOT
this is a subject my english teacher talks about at least  in  lessons and her only evidence is that she who is a teacher new this year gets paid less then the male english teacher who works here already since  years she also started the subject about an actress that is new got paid less then an already famous actor,NOT

not everyone is perfect when they first start going vegan i think she got the message and thats a great start you guys also forget she has a binge eating disorder you cant fix an eating disorder overnight so what if she ate chicken the other day she also doesnt seem to know how to eat vegan yet give her time,NOT

hey trish its so easy to eat vegan i know youre doing it for health reasons and thats a great start stick to whole foods the best u can and cut out or limit processed foods if u want to lose weight also you dont have to necessarily be an animal lover to be against animal cruelty so the fact that you have cut down your meat consumption is awesome and there are so many dairy alternatives that youre basically giving up nothing youre just eating the plant based and healthier version good luck and keep doing research on why going vegan is the best thing for your body the animals and our planet,NOT

lots of people didnt actually watch the video did they,NOT
while the gender pay gap may be exaggerated in somemany scenarios to prove a point this video neglects to mention anything on american work culture gender roles and previous cases of when employees of opposite sex but most identical profession responsibility and qualification receive noticeably different pay for their work for seemingly no other attributable factor and the legal action that has been effectively taken based on this,NOT
pauses video  reads comments old video got it moving on,NOT
i like trisha but she came out as a chicken nugget not that lang ago how is anyone supposed to take her seriously now also her explanation was whack as hell,NOT
fellow liberal brethren and sistren stay out of the comments i beg of ye conservatives have flooded our safe space with triggering opposing viewpoints dont read their idiotic and problematic posts or they might just change your mind not because theyre right but because of their patriarchal control and use of sexist facts,NOT
thats me theology career lowest paying mostly male college career lol,NOT
i can just see it now disliked unsubbed this doesnt support my feminist agenda this is bullshit good video vox,NOT

the reason im putting this on the internet is i want views and i want to be part of the drama lmao,NOT
either remove gender division from sports completely or create a new transgender category this is simply unfair no two ways about it,ABU
how the care is divided up can be boiled down to instinct men often increase their work hours while women often decrease their hours of work this is something that no amount of social pressure of political activism could ever change this is because there are biological reactions that women have to rearing children even years after theyre born specifically one that happens for most of a childs infancy is lactation breast feeding isnt something you can do and work at the same time even if your work is from home on a computer and its something that only women can do one of the things about the early physical reactions to kids that women have is that they create habits in the time that the mother cant work due to recovering from pregnancy and and a cocktail of chemicals that the brain releases resulting in women not even wanting to be away from their child for  minuets the father assuming that theyre still in the picture has increased his hour of work in an attempt to ensure that the family is well provided for putting his boss in the habit of expecting him to continue to go above and beyond which pretty much locks his situation unless hes willing to loose his job in which event the family would fall apart due to financial struggles so hes not going to risk that and since his hands are tied by the time the mother is capable of entering the work force again she ends up having to take a more lenient job with time at work which often pay less than the jobs where your lack of presence could cost the company money in which case youd be fired so that she can remain on all in case of an emergency with the kids during early child care its not possible to divide up the work evenly and later during child care people are prone to habit and often dont bother trying to fix what isnt broken,NOT
lmao who else remembers when trish and shane would give freelee so much shit it shanes old vlogs haha like they would legit bully her idk what changed im lost now,NOT
k people understand that the title of this video is a blatant lie if you actually watch the video,NOT
ok i am  yrs old and have always been told i am observer of the human scene and i have witnessed something interesting these gender wage gap surveys cant be generalized for every and all jobs i have witnessed half a dozen examples where women actually make more than men in some industries doesnt anyone say anything about that no because of the modern feminist movement fact is that were human beings and we usually gravitate toward a man or woman when a seeking a service or a product need an example i used to work as a bartender and server i cleared more tips in a day than my male counterparts cleared in a week need something further up the food chain i disagree with what this lady said about male nurses as i used to work in a hospital and heard the stories about nurses even with male nurses who would chat with me when days were slow i have witnessed first hand that female nurses get paid more than their male counterparts to the point that there male counterparts have to go on welfare because they can make enough to even pay their bills even you are a doctor at times a person will gravitate more toward a woman or a man example women who are gynecologists dermatologists acupuncturists psychiatrists psychologists alternative health professionals get paid more than their male counterparts how do i know this i work as medical biller and have done this job for  years doing bills for various healthcare professionals so is there a gender pay gap no i have come to the conclusion that it all just depends on where you are in the world how you work etc,NOT
just dont fall into the pseudo science bs that goes around some of the vegan community that you can eat unlimited calories and still loose weight obviously dont restrict but eat a reasonable amount of calories like ,NOT
lmaothe truth is that theyre too scared to race against actual men so they pussied out and have infiltrated the womens track team under some pathetic disguise so they can win,ABU
id like to take this one step further and question why female dominated college majors dont pay off i mean were talking early childhood education psychology community organization and social work these things are unarguably important and no less essential to a functioning society than petroleum engineering so why does so little money flow there making the jobs even more unattractive than they already are the way different working fields are rewarded directly reflects on what values a society holds and while economic interests may be a justification its surely not an ethical one sorry for any grammar errors not a native speaker,NOT
buy in bulk try getting the whole fruit instead of packaged i personally have a few small meals a day instead of  big meals because when you eat fruits and vegetables you get hungry faster and dont just cut off sweets buy a donut or a cookie that is vegan so that you wont crave non began foods love you trisha and i hope these tips help you,NOT
yea what they miss is that people lie vox deliberately lie to them about this nonissue to push their agenda its a hoax,NOT
if a woman did the same job as me from day one and worked the same hours and we both had promotions at the same time she would earn the same as me end of talking generally is irrelevant and there will always be a difference in earnings much like there will always be a difference in time taken out of the workplace and time spent shopping for clothes it all comes down to a difference in life decisions which is evident between men and women peoples decisions are neither right or wrong nor good or bad but either way they will affect statistics,NOT
what if men are created to work and women are designed not to,NOT
why is there any gap at all no one knows i do women as a whole arent as productive in any given workweek hourlong bathroom breaks for bloating  menstruation moments product replacement touching up makeup postpartuming crying all these thing keep them away from their work more work equals more advancement which equals more compensation then theres the maternity thing women who have been conditioned to believe they can have it all  a career and raise a family  will take considerably more time off after a baby is born come in late leave early twohour lunches all of these keep them away from their work,ABU
sorry girl you liking to be around guys more than girls you feeling like you can relate to a guy you feeling like you would like to see what its like to have a penis none of this means you are transgender it means you like attention you dont have women friends because youre jealous and catty and dont allow yourself to see past a womans threat to you to get to know them or have a real friendship with them and your just in need of internet content to pay the bills,NOT
id like to thank the vegan activists educators media producers scientists doctors farm abuse activists inventive cooks and vegan product producers  i used to be one of those ignorant fools who thought you cant get enough proteinnutrients seeing fat or malnourished vegans and thought the point was proven they were just not doing it right i ate abuseddiseased meat without thinking of the savagery that farm animals face the internet and the free flow of information is the greatest gift to humanity it has enabled me to start making the switch and its been pretty effortless i dont feel any different really as ive always had a pretty healthy diet but i do know that plant protein sources have much more nutrients than meat which only really provides proteinsb vitamins however its comforting to know that my diet isnt destroying our home planet earth what makes me feel great is knowing im not a part of the torture of farm animals i am no longer a part of a reason of their  agony screams torture living completely hopeless lives of extreme suffering humans are the masters of the earth we should not be such disgraceful creatures and treat our home as if were monkeys flinging our feces everywhere we should respect ourselves by respecting our home and be honorable responsible stewards of planet earth,NOT
its called being a tomboy trish ive been like that my whole life too you literally described me except being trans im more gender neutral tho,NOT

do they miss the fact it doesnt exist,NOT
omg pewdiepie made a shutout video about vegan youtuber  sorsha,NOT
i wouldnt be surprised if freelee and dr paid you to make this,NOT
in other words women have more privilege flexibility and choice and can achieve a lifework balance men simply have less workplace rights and have to work more than women women dont need to work as much as men because quite often men support their partners lifestyle choices if you want the wage gap to disappear lets stop putting the responsibility on men to pay for everything and lets give them equal workplace rights paternity leave and retirement age,NOT

i like this side of freelee,NOT
so many people butt hurt because of a  minute youtube video,NOT
a whole  minute video to conclude by saying that women should get paid the same for working casual hours while men work full time nice one vox,NOT
i dont get why she would even troll about this then again im not trisha and im not such an attention whore this does showcase the ease with which these statements are accepted in certain places which disturbs me can we please get all the poor souls coming out as trans psychological help most of the younger ones have a lot of other issues too and believe those should be treated first depression is shite anxiety is shite ptsd sounds like hell no matter how you look at it a lot of trans people need help in more ways than one i dont think trishas behaviour helps one bit it does feel a little bit insensitive and the internet just isnt the place for these kinds of troll vids it would fit better on stage in the show of a comedian as a side note i get annoyed with the gender is a social construct thing technically gender is a social construct if you view in the way that gender is the way you express your feminity or masculinity which nobody means when they use the word gender in this context and sex is biological however when people use it interchangeably im thinking theyre wrong otherwise there wouldnt be a need for certain people to even feel trans nevermind actually go through the medical roller coaster in one way or another,ABU
freelee you look so cute,NOT
once a man always a man,ABU
if ugys pay more for stuff we then we should get paid more example insurance,NOT
vox should break this down in how it improves the lives of insecure driftless and unambitious males especially whiney white guys that think that being on the starting lineup of their hs football team is enough to score a hot chick except that it doesnt it takes an age old power from domineering entitled men in that if he knocks a girl up shes his and she will have to depend on his income and he will have most of the power in the household with women and men making similar wages in jobs that dont require college these woman no longer need to marry or even stay with shiftless men unfortunately a lot will still sleep with them and with birth control access varying from state to state sometimes that still ends up in babies that can link you to a car wreck for forever ugh then these sons having bad or no example of a good male role model assume super macho attitudes and just keep on continuing the cycle sad and pathetic,NOT
this makes me soo happy,NOT
trish is no longer vegan she posted a video about  mins ago her eating a lot of meat and its only been  days pls do a video freelee btw i love you so much,NOT

that video was a little different in my opinion i legit feel like trisha just wants so badly to belong somewhere thats shes just grabbing at straws now and not caring who she hurts on her way i dont think this is her trolling i think this is her desperately trying to inject herself somewhere anywhere she thinks she might be accepted,NOT
i posted this video as a comment on a facebook news post about the wage gap and i got locked out of my account for  weeks,NOT
try popping some sliced bananas in the freezer and once frozen blend them up and boom you got ice cream,NOT

my english teacher was talking about the pay gap i wanted to correct her but i didnt want to look sexist and i didnt want to get into argument with my english teacher,NOT
i actually liked this video but using a click bait title like there is no pay gap then saying its only  is kinda contradictory atleast in my view,NOT
you cannot eat as much as you want as a vegan,NOT
 actual wage gap shrinks to only  cents when you factor in different choices men and women make  the small wage gap that does exist has to do with differences in individual career choices but thats exactly what the study accounted for,NOT
we have lost our minds,NOT
love how yt puts all the alphabet media outlets st but they always have double the thumbs down makes sense get woke go broke,NOT
i cant get enough of this documentary thank you for all that you do you are showing people that there is a better way we can all make better choices and a vegan lifestyle is the way,NOT

trishahas a boy haircut in her music vid nobody trisha i am non binary transgender drag queen male,NOT
well aerospace engineers get paid too much in comparison you see preschool teachers should get the same see how that works,NOT
the video kinda proved that the pay gap doesnt exist by itself however let me rephrase it women are paid less on average because they make different lifestyle choices like working dangerous jobs in remote areas what the video asserts is the solution is to change the way businesses operate to suit workers while this is ideal for getting rid of a number previously proven to mean nothing the gender wage gap this will never happen as meetings are not scheduled around home life and if they are they will be erratic and inefficient as such while this is one example i think the message that should be taken from one of voxs best political videos is that the wage gap is while a fact not one that is directly indicative of the common implication that men are paid more,NOT
if women really got paid less than why wouldnt businesses only hire woman so they wouldnt have to pay as many wages,NOT
im actively losing brain cells,NOT
i dont think youll see the results you want from going vegan in just  weeks ive been on the diet for about  months and ive lost  pounds my skin looks clearer no more zits i feel a lot healthier in general it took a long time though to get into a good rhythm with food i did so much research and watched so many food diaries on youtube i think its a good step but youre not going to reap the benefits you want off of this diet in just  weeks you might not even lose weight freelee looks great but she also exercises a lot shes very active i do think as a vegan you need to find a balance your body needs fats and oils which freelee is against i use coconut oil to cook with and extra virgin olive oil i also eat avocados and almonds to get my fats in i still eat between  calories a day to  depending on my daily activity and because im dieting a little i dont think everyone can just eat as many calories as they like from fruit and veggies and lose weight doing it everyones lifestyle is different get your veggies in for sure my food diary usually consists of eating almonds with all natural organic peanut butter ill have a smoothie with  bananas frozen berries hemp protein almond milk sometimes a date or  then other days ill switch my bananas for an avocado with spinach and berries and coconut water for lunch and dinner i usually eat similar things it could be a veggie burger pasta with veggies quinoa or brown rice with veggies i like spicy foods so if youre like me youll enjoy this snack i buy peppers and red pepper hummus and just dip peppers into that and omg its so good if im craving chocolate i usually buy some organic dark chocolate put it in the freezer and snap off a piece now and then always make sure you read the back of the label with everything you buy theres lots of information out there immerse yourself in research and youll do great also if youre craving meat id buy meat from morning star or gardien for cheese always go with chao cheese its the only cheese brand so far thats impressed me dont expect the fake meats and cheese to be identical to the real stuff its different just still tasty in its individual way,NOT
ive been watching trishs videos for a long time and i dont think ive ever made a comment i can tell she means well and has a good heart but shes such an incredible actor that shell believe her own lies,NOT
finally this is a big step for the community keep it up freelee,NOT
trisha is the best troll even though i know shes trolling i still click on it and forget for a second that she most likely doesnt mean it,NOT
not a claim its biological science they are genetically males not girls no matter how they feel they will always be faster no matter what,NOT
i used to be annoyed by you because of how ignorant i was on the entire vegan movement but one day i started to listen and watch your videos and im so glad i did you have really opened my eyes im a vegetarian now and im striving to be vegan im so glad people like you spread this knowledge ,NOT
this is extremly sad but i put a custom sound for my ex boyfriends messages that sounds exactly like  and i thought he texted me ,NOT
send this to evry feminozie,NOT
i totally agree with you love your content,NOT
its plainly illegal in the modern world uk and us for example to pay a woman less for the same amount of work if its happening she needs to sue otherwise nothing can be done now that feminists have invested billions and a holiday in this total non issue will they consider discussing how men are  of workplace deaths and suicides oh yeah thats right theyre feminists and they do not care about men at all even to the point of manufacturing issues for attention right now women in the west can either work like any man or become a housewife and have her husband pay for everything then possibly divorce and get half his cash meanwhile men in the west like all of history must work or else they are less then trash feminists have no plan on correcting this huge imbalance and in fact will work to keep it in place,NOT
only problem ive seen is that women  not mothers dont get raises as often men but aside form that if women want equal pay for equal work stop having kids to a business kids are a burden that take you away from your job and making them money a working mom is not as valuable as a childless male or female or even a working father who takes little time off get over it you chose to have kids and the problems that come with them you cant expect to be paid the same as a person who rarely takes off and works on holidays and over time while you take off to spend time with your kids or take care of them if they are sick its just common sense,NOT
listen to them voices full of testosteroneic puberty i believe only transgenders who havent gone through puberty can compete with girls these men should not conpete,ABU
their muscles are glisteningin th in the wind huh,NOT
trish has many many personalities and maybe one of her personalities actually is a gay dude why cant she vent her feelings like you others want to dopeople always want to be gatekeepers on sexual feelings exhausting agree or disagreeand move onlive your own sexual life no one has to accept you or agree with you but we should all tolerate each others choices it has no meaning to my life so why do we care what she feels or wants,NOT
ive wanted to slap the shit out of two people so bad this is extremely unfair to every female athlete competing against biological men who like to dress up and wear makeup step the fuck down,ABU
the problem of men earning more than women can be solved easily and economically all are paid equal for the same work and although all are paid according to the womens tariff point of view women do not earn less but men get too much  problem solved has anyone actually noticed that feminists like men want to be treated and behave like men they do not want to be feminine  at the same time they criticize the behavior of the men  total sickness ,ABU
yaaaay this is freelees impact d,NOT
nope advantage like that one boxer its truth  i cant support this and im gay,NOT
sad to see so many people hating on someone that has such an incredibly hard time identifying with themselves their body and just who they even are wtf is wrong with yall get a life,NOT
sure youre right about career choices but do you not think theres a reason that those tend to be the career paths chosen by the different sexes women are discouraged from taking the highest paying majors because of social conditioning to believe that its a male dominated field and that women should be carers first and foremost,NOT
well doesnt that show that the wage gap is not based oh discrimination just job choice and different hours,NOT
lol trisha is stupid,ABU
if u want to save the planet stop consumeing and stop breeding,NOT
if she was trans she wouldnt of gotten like  boob jobs i cant stand her lmao,NOT
there isnt a wage gap just look at what its referenced for the math earnings not hourly wages if you must claim there is a gap at least recognize that it isnt in the wage paid but in what people earn,NOT
those guys should not be racing with the girls thats fucking stupid,ABU
since when was vox honest where are their daily doses of leftist bullshit,NOT
 is not nothing the video content is good but make the title truth please,NOT
it feels so good to hear a woman saying this thank you for being reasonable intelligent and openminded real openmindedness not blatant hypocrisy,NOT
pleeeaaase react to pewdiepies new video,NOT
whilst i agree that the traditional idea and slogan of  cents to a dollar is misleading and fails to take into account all kinds of factors we cant blame the lack of women in the scientific fields on the idea that men and women make different choices its a weak argument there remains strong social stigmas and discouragement against girls and women in those fields which we must fight against,NOT
nice video just a comment that is entirely not related to the content but to the presentation your hands keep moving in an almost closed but weird way like a claw i know for most people this is stupid but i think a youtube video maker should try to improve every aspect of his videos besides that very good explanation ,NOT
lol female economists doing their research on wage gap aka being useless and wasting time there isnt any respected economist that ever considered this wage gap thing of any significance the fact that its still talked about from mid th century till now is proof that no professional actually cares about it because it simply doesnt exist and if it does there doesnt appear to be any effects on the economy its merely something for media and women rights activists to play with,ABU
it sucks that people cant just let her do what she wants and not complain and fucking cry about everything,NOT
its all about money industry funded studies,NOT
you should get a lot of vegan junk food at the begin to help you transition that made it a bunch easier for me no judgment from me i just hope your two weeks as a vegan go very well   ,NOT
am i the only one hysterically crying while watching this over how far we have come,NOT
i am vegetarian trying to eat mostly vegan but not all cuz i cant cuz i live with my grandparents my advice is follow a lot of boards on pinterest thats what i do lol im sooo proud of you trish i hope the vegan community welcomes you with open arms and i hope you love it ive been vegetarian for awhile and i dont crave meat love you boo ,NOT
theres also the fact that women on average go to the doctor more often takes more sick days and works less overtime this is not to say anything bad about women they are usually and i dare to say of course on this more likely to be the ones that take care of children and do chores around the house besides if you earn more than k dollars a year before tax then theres nothing to complain about,NOT
do i identify as a vegan do i enjoy a pig roast hell yeah   were these people vaccinated against common sense as a child is there a crazy ass hypnotist making their way around the world creating an alternate universe in these sad peoples minds i fear for my kids how the hell are kids supposed work this all out when the crazies are spouting this sort of crap,NOT
omg im crying so glad to know everyone is listening at least some why dont all listen thats my question ive lost  lbs so far and still i will fight for all to learn the truth eat fruits juice juice and juice raw for life,NOT
u srs i cant make nearly as much money as an escort as a woman can,NOT
so if women would choose to work crappy hours like men choose to work crappy hours theyll make almost the same holy cow what a concept,NOT
when you coffee store or in your house you can use coconut milk thats the best for all in starbucks they do not have it always but i order soy and no whip cream,NOT
this footage is pretty old on her vlog channel she said that her vegan diet lasted maybe two days,NOT
this is so unfair i applaud the people who were below the running men,ABU
shes a transtrender nothing more,NOT
you need to wash your grapes and everything else before you eat them,NOT
so if we want the wage gap to go away we need to encourage our daughters to go into higher paying fields i can do that ,NOT
what about the fact that it aint true,NOT
watch mommytang on you tube if i go vegan it would be the way she has done it i have to have warm filling foods and she does rice and stir fry that looks so good,NOT
good for you you will need a b suppliment  cooking with spices is important as well a cheap simple protein packed meal is brown rice and beanschickpeasblackbeans anything you like with veggies also a really good smoothies is an an apple a frozen banana spinach and chia seeds soooo good and its an easy way to eat raw spinach xoxo,NOT
girl if you crave chicken get the boca chicken patties or nuggets you cannot tell the difference i swear they r lying lol,NOT
why cant they make mens womens trans men and trans womens sports teams problem solved,ABU
please say im not the only one that is confused af,NOT
so basically one of the main reasons for the pay gap is because women take care of the kids what a twist there are also other factors that greatly inflate the most commonly sighted statistic i also noticed that the graph showing wage gap distribution between different types of occupations ranges from  and  while this video is pretty biased its at least well researched and has some useful information so long as you take it with a grain of salt just be aware that they only covered a small part of the problem and said problem tends to be greatly exaggerated and now i realize that this video came out  years ago and im probably gonna be blasted from both sides of the argument if this comment section is still active,NOT
didnt she release a video years ago about being gay is a choice and now shes trans lol girl bye,NOT
be sure to stay away from carbworship,NOT
lol  men beat women in a sport,NOT

im sorry people are hating on you so much in the comments i wish i like knew you personally bc i am trans and have a ton of trans friends n would love to tell you a lot about different trans experiences one piece of advice would be to not get too invested in online trans communities theres a huge war in the trans world rn and its most definitely not good to people just joining trans communities online,NOT
anyone ever tought about the fact that men on average are just better in business,NOT
this support is amazing honestly my view on freelee have changed for the better and its nice to see all the positivity,NOT
i hate the banana girl,NOT
so shes clearly nuts and is extraordinarily unbalanced mentally  with all of these little admissions of hers that much is obvious looks like a woman acts like some women thinks like some women clearly a woman  and she even knows she was born female has female biology and everything outward indicates an identification with this but thinks she transsexual but also or has in the past thinks shes you know what it doesnt even matter you get a person saying certain things out loud and they just lose all credibility  the chances of a person coming back from that and ever mentally being capable of handling more or being more are slimtonone shes not ever going to get more intelligent she was an idiot then and is still clearly an idiot now this is the problem with insular thinking particularly when youre not even remotely intelligent or capable of honest selfanalysis or selfawareness  you think stupid things for terrible or nonreasons and then you start to believe them because this stuff never came out of your mouth in the presence of intelligent honest critical people if it ever did at all  trisha was never set straight and had it explained to her why she is wrong and will likely never be right for the rest of her existence best case scenario shes a troll that thinks this is somehow a good idea and that just makes her an asshole and an idiot  worst case scenario she actually thinks this way and shes many neurons short a coherent thought and shes a different kind of idiot why are the available options never good all that saved me in this video was blaire  blaire and that adorable nosescratch she did,ABU
many plastics like commercial shopping bags contain chemicals often referred to as slip agents which are derived from the stearic acid in animal fat they essentially prevent the polymers from sticking to metals during manufacturing and clinging to each other afterward some bike tires also contain these elements ,NOT
oh god we get that vegans are such amazing people blabla stop spamming us with this this is becoming extremely ridiculous if people wants to eat meat than let them do that and stop judging it like vegans are angels who will save the world btw dont forget to convert carnivorous animals as well to the amazing vegan life,NOT

please please start an onlyfans account,NOT
if there was a wage gap i would hire  of women so the company gets more profit so the wage gap isnt entirely truefeminists are outta control ik vox isnt feminist i debunked one part of the wage gap but most if not all is true,NOT
the information shown in this video doesnt account for how women are more unlikely to not work over time more likely are to take time off work and how women are more likely to follow their time scheduled for work while men are more likely to be their when the company needs them calls them in companies pay more for employees who are able to do this women also own the majority in in four of the five lowest paying majors women are also less likely to take jobs involving risk and are less competitive in the work force the video is correct in how most statistics that show a pay gap dont show the factors yet neither does theirs there are more factors involved then what the video has told you and what i have stated the video does not give a full synopsis on the wage gap,NOT
my sister just got triggered when i showed this to her,NOT
freelee what happened to your instagram i cant access it ,NOT

i had seizure just listening to her,NOT
god i love blaire shes such a queen,NOT
this is not fair at all,NOT
a big reason for you to go plant based trish would be your mental health i cannot stress how much it helped my mental health all this processed foods and animal products you eat really do damage inside your body which has an effect on your brain chemistry and because you barely eat real food fruits and veg your body doesnt get the nutrients it needs to be healthy and because you often starve yourself your brain doesnt get the energy it needs truly eating mostly real food and plant based foods will do so much good for your mental health because your brain will get the energy your body the nutrients the inflammation in your body will lower this all has a huge effect on your brain and thus your mental health,NOT

piers morgan hated by the right hated by the left hated by everyone,NOT
thanks for telling the truth in a simple and intelligente way,NOT
they have literally zero links to sources which for a site that considers themselves a university is very suspect since a student handing in a paper w no way to reach sources would fail i wanted to see the articles myself but it seems as if the channel wants to hide these studies if someone could find these studies i may believe the video but since i havent seen any links i cant trust this video,NOT
there is no wage gap there is no patriarchy and there is no oppression towards women ,NOT
the starch sollution youtube,NOT
transgender people should compete amongst each other thats the only fair way,ABU

as a transgender man i understand the struggle and overcompensation not liking the attention etc however i do think you should see a therapist that knows their stuff about gender dysphoria and gender therapy,NOT
freelee sucks because she stole content look up how freelee stole from us by get upset,NOT
sidenote i love that the title is there is no gender wage gap and to prove that point they helpfully included a study that found that there is a gender wage gap its just really small top marks ,NOT
nice vid vox is usually kinda bad at this sort of stuff so what we learned the wage gap is a non issue and personal choice is the reason for it,NOT
lets think about this it doesnt account for types of hours or amount that ive seen this means that if later hours pay more and they typically do then the later hours that are made up of men because of their flexibility are being compared as the same as lesser paying hours,NOT
veganism  optimum mental and physical health,NOT
means no dick for her ,ABU
so this video is just showing that you want a haircut,NOT
i wonder if women gravitate towards the occupations that dont pay as well or if we as a society dont value the occupations that women gravitate towards if it is the former why would women do that,NOT
but some career choices dont allow women to duo certain things and some sexism is actually in school so i go home and i tell my mom that at school that let the boys do fun things like move chairs table but only thing girls can do is file papers so and then she said well the try not to hurt the girls we so we can have children well its not obligated for a women to have children,NOT
so stop calling it a wage gap and start calling it an earnings gap,NOT

please stay vegan ,NOT
it should be called an earnings gap which basically comes down to women wanting to be paid for the traditionally free labour they provided at home before entering the work force the left needs to stop insisting that there is a gender wage gap and the right like this video needs to stop saying that everything is equal because it isnt,NOT
the vegans already got their hatred for everything vegan suck energy instead of meat,NOT

this isnt fair to the other females on the team i have nothing against transgenders but at the end of the day their birth certificates says male they are physically stronger than born females males competing against females is unfair which is why gender sports are separated  maybe someone should start a team with transgenders  this is taking away scholarships from the other girls,ABU

thanks a lot liberals lmao why are they being allowed to compete while doing gender hormone therapy,NOT
if there really is a wage gap based on a patriarchy then all greedy business owners have to do is fire all of their male workers and only hire women since they can pay them less thats how this works right,NOT
k feminists missed the like button with their sausage fingers,NOT
medical science is only in its infancy yet it has shown that our natural diet is that which grows out of the ground  abdulbah bahai faith,NOT
so what youre saying is that because of the disproportionate amount of women in lower paying fields andor raising children working less or innumerable other circumstances that prevent them from working in higher wage employment or recieving bonuses or raises  statiscally speaking the wage gap doesnt really exist,NOT
i cant picture this lasting ,NOT

you can use similar conflating variables to explain away the racial pay gap you cant credibly cite equal pay for equal work when the demographics you are discussing are not getting equal work in the first place unconscious biases which affect hiring  promotion  evaluation remain things that show up in serious studies time and time again in spite of claims based mom make here toxicity in too many education and professional environments often leave only the women who are willing to tough it out often at great costs to their minds and hearts as the weinstein revelations show and on the based mom thing why prageru long after the revelations that have come out about fellow gator hero milo after the gator conspiracies and handwaving excuses have been exposed for what they are are you continuing to be affiliate with and promote in your ads anyone even remotely associated with that altriech terrorist campaign masquerading as citizenjournalism nevermind based mom of all people she thinks mentally ill kids should just tough out harassment and physical abuse in public schools we see the fruit of such policies on that which is swept under the rug as bullying it costs lives chs was a disgusting oftdiscredited woman even before she affiliated with that fake movement over an imagined review for a free game she is the stella kbler of our time and prageru is made all the less credible by her involvement,NOT

i do not suggest following freelees diet her diet lacks in omega s and many other things plus if youre just starting a vegan diet and all you can eat it fruit and potatoes youre going to get bored you cant eat unlimited food either trust me i gained weight following her diet to a t check out the vegan corner and cooking with plants for some good recipes i suggest using the website cronometer to make sure youre getting enough nutrients in  even meat eaters should do this also find a bmr calculator to calculate how many calories you should get in a day theres also plenty of vegan junk food if you arent in the mood to be healthy,NOT
check out mommy tang she is vegan and has great recipes,NOT
she didnt mention gender dismorphia once,NOT
yeah literally what the fuck is trisha saying,ABU
she just explained why the wage gap doesnt exist,NOT
werent u a baby two seconds ago,NOT
i thought the thing that people miss about the wage gap was going to be that women of color are paid less than white women it would have been interesting to see that factored in to this angle,NOT
basically because women take a larger role in raising children,NOT
yaaaaaas trish yaaaas you go girl  best news in a while  eat all the carbs keep it up youll feel so good,NOT
that is such an adorable kitty omg ,NOT
so why dont women go for the highpaying university courses again oh right sexism please rethink saying the pay gap is unrelated to sexism,NOT
this puts me on a whole new level of anger some of us struggle with having breastsme im  i couldnt come out to my mother when i wanted to at the age so i could not get puberty blockers and i was put on a medication or multiple medications that made my breasts way too big and i always wonder what id be like if i didnt get put on that medication but this angers the hell out of me she was all on pornhub showing off everything and shes always giving off signs of attention seeking idk this is really ridiculous,ABU

i want a thatbitch merch in a hoodie,NOT
freelee can you also make videos for trish focussing on how eating animal products not eating enough plant foods and not eating a steady supply of healthy energy fucks up her mental health this would be a big one for her too going vegan helped me so much with my mental health problems simply because of the reduction of inflammation in my body the loads of nutrients from plants and the steady supply of glucose to my brain i mean i know you know what i mean because you have experienced the same its time trish got some relief from her mental problems,ABU
personally this hurts my family my mom is in a great job the thing is shes a single mother and she raises me and my younger sister if we had a father more money would be rolling in and as my sister and i get older we also need more money only having one woman bringing in money for all three of us let alone our bills we also have a decently sized  story house doesnt sustain us enough and sometimes results in money being tight this is an issue for all women of all aspects many women work just as hard or even harder i hope i can grow up to work in an age where i can receive equal pay for the work im doing compared to a man,NOT
to all the people saying that hormone therapy will make this fair why is it never girl to boy transgenders winning in sports they take testosterone  why is it only boy to girl transgenders winning stuff why is there no girl to boy transgenders playing in the nhl or nba well i can answer that for you because hormones and if not male bone density muscle mass larger frame more physical force and stamina there are also factors in our brainwiring such as men are more risk taking and agressive which would give them an edge if you insist that men compete against women in sports you are actively for eliminating womens sports thats just what it is either you feel sympathy for men who think they are women or you are for obliterating female sports thats your choice,NOT
like all this for her kid didnt win a trophy  their on hormones and they are happy just make you kid run faster period do not ruin any other child happiness over a piece of metal tf  i would always yeah my child to thing what if that was you  track are these girls left why take that away from them  if we wanna speak of genetics how about they are black  black males and females run faster then other races ,NOT
 starting to sound like she heard the man by taylor swift and was like video idea,NOT

the end of female sports if i was a person that bets on sports ill pick the transgender all day going up against a women,NOT
shes trolllingggg ohmygod,NOT
why is there so many dislikes,NOT
why are there so many dislikes lol,NOT
having male genitals means you are a male cutting off said genitals makes you a male who cut his genitals off,ABU
not really a wage gap more an earnings gap,NOT
i like the whole argument but he best part is that a women proves this to be true though thank you for making these statements,NOT
this is one of my fav trisha paytas videos trish i know u wont read this but ur one of my fav ppl ever and u always make my day,NOT
i go through periods of subscribing unsubscribing and resubscribing to you just resubscribed i dont agree with a lot of your motives which is more on me than you due to my severe ed background and mental health activism so any type of video commentary on anothers body sets me off still i always wind up coming back to you because there really is such a sweetness and kindness that just radiates from you i really believe that this is why so many people watch you youre the kind of person that just draws people in i think it would be cool to make a video on junkier vegan foods andor meat alternatives for trisha i know the goal is partly health but i really believe that if she is exposed to just how many delicious vegan chips and pastries and whatever are out there  she may begin to see just how sustainable and restrictive veganism is just a thought  ,NOT
this video is making me wanna go vegan tbh ive thought about it every now and then,NOT
how will using animal poop for fertilizer harm animals that has been original fertilizer since plants and animals began living together its a cycle the animal eats the plant and poops so that other plants can get nutrients,NOT
this feels like a midlife crisis girl sort your shit out,NOT
so great to see how far weve come so proud of the whole community ,NOT
i cant believe someone would create such a biased video without addressing any of the real factors women may choose to work other jobs because they dont have a choice they dont want to endure the stress of putting up with harassment in jobs that are more suitable for men their husbands expect them to take care of their children therefore not giving them any other choice but to stay at home and imagine being a woman and part of another minority group you will be facing a lot of social barriers videos like these will not change the social structure that has been created over generations so please review your work before making such a biased and misleading video,NOT
hours should not be made more flexible women just need to be better at managing their time along with men taking an equal share of parenting responsibilities work is work for a reason you are there because thats whenhow your employer needs you to be,NOT
i think you actually have to transition to be a transgender lmaoooo,NOT
yaaaayyy so excited for you trish,NOT
i mean no disrespect to anyone but im very thankful i was born in the s and not s because so many people would try to tell me that im trans because im a tomboy im semi happy being a woman but i dont wanna be a man i wanna stay at home in my pajamas with my hair up i wanna go as hard as i can at the gym but dont wanna be a body builder and i wanna wear makeup  times a year excluding halloween dont need to follow any kinda stereotype i just need to be me ,NOT

my sister was watching phineas and ferb so the opening was playing and you know the part discovering something that doesnt exist that played exactly the minute i saw this video,NOT
trish  youre just a tom boy periodt,NOT
i respectfully disagree with this i offer the anecdote that my wife managed a store and was paid less than a male in the same position even when she exceeded the seniority he had for background we are both politically conservative,NOT
basically what i got from this video is that trust wants to be a man and there is nothing wrong with that but she couldve just said i wanna be a man instead of this whole video lol,NOT
they called themselves brave an different no both kids are still producing an excessive amount of t and should not be allowed to compete with girls and if the do it should only be for exhibition and no medal or a separate medal its selfish to force the masses to let go of their dreams for the dreams of other kids,ABU
yay trisha for the most part i try to eat vegan and i love it i found channon rose through u and saw she had some vegan food videos that were helpful for me so maybe they will help u,NOT
 everyone kicking off in the comment section calm the fuck down yall she can go vegan for whatever reason she wants she doesnt even have to justify herself simmer down loves,NOT
wow that devils advocate qa reveals just how uncaring and clueless those transgenders are but michael hears a compelling argument on both sides  the sorting continues,NOT
been vegan for  years best thing ive ever done,NOT
i wonder where the feminazis went,ABU
said it once ill say it again you dont put able bodied athletes against disabled athletes why because it put the disabled person at a disadvantage in this case it puts the trans athletes at an advantage whether you like it or not its discrimination against those who are born female you cannot treat a person with a protected characteristic less or more favourably that is discrimination sorry but thats the law guys xx,ABU
also u live in la or near la idk so there are much more vegan restaurant options there so thats good google some restaurants around u after these two weeks bc i know u like to go out to eat gurl,NOT
woman work different jobs and dont work the same hours as men thats it,NOT
those dislikes are high must be all the tumber feminists triggered because they explained it without the use of a patriarchal conspiracy welldone vox still though is it really a problem if its life choices,NOT
veganism is the only community filled with drama you havent been a part of you know many of yt so called vegans are fakes many have mental issues including drugs and alcoholism and they have been in and out of rehabs feel free to fit in with the loony fruit bats,ABU
let the women work stay home dads are the new thing xd,NOT

ive supported you through a lot of stupid shit but you lost me with this please educate yourself youre about to get dragged,NOT
eat when ur hungry so you dont starve yourself otherwise you might get an eating disorder,NOT
what the hell happened to her eyes in this one,NOT
what your geting paid,NOT
theres a reason economists dont buy the wage gap think if you could pay women less than men for the same output firms that hire more women would drive the business that hire more men out of business which doesnt happen,NOT
men get more money cuz women expect them to pay for dinner,NOT
so what is there to hate about this video why would you unlike it these are facts,NOT
but its not real,NOT
the thumbnail is fucking killing it,NOT
why are you interviewing these two punks what about the girls,NOT
this is so accurate that is offensive lmao,NOT
hey trish a vegan here  first off if you want to succeed you absolutely shouldnt even consider not eating as much as you want the only way you are going to gain weight on a vegan diet us if you eat oily fatty foods so if you want to lose weight as quickly as possible eliminate all overt fatsavocado nuts seeds coconuts etc that most of their calories come from fat also eat as much while foods as possible like ricepotatoes beans lentils oats and such those are going yo make you satiated and full for a looong time that packaged watermelon shouldnt even be a snack and it is not good a idea to eat it at lunch time bc melons have a high water content so they are best digested if eaten first thing in the morning otherwise you are going to be bloated and gassy for example you can eat fruit as breakfast for lunch you can make potato fries that you bake in the oven instead of dunking them in oil you can make rice stir fry with loots of veggies and rice again no oil there are endless recepies search around youtube also watch mrmrs vegan on youtube they are from la and have helped me a looot to understand how to eat properly and have very educational videos hope you continue this after the weeks aaand good luck ,NOT
giiirrl you can literally eat almost everything you do now just modify it it gets easier as you get the hang of it ive been vegan for   years and my best advice to you is to not be so hard on yourself if you slip at first the transition is a little difficult if you have a nonvegan craving then go ahead and let yourself have that nonvegan food one last time just make sure you pick yourself back up and keep going you got it girl its really not as difficult as people think,NOT
vegan for three years now and just the best decision i have ever made energy level is the best outcome,NOT
the  cents for every dollar story is obviously not the point discrimination happens before wage realizes and works exactly by influencing the choices this video talks about this is something you can hardly change through legislation we need a culture of equality,NOT
thank you for this ,NOT
but you just bought a new lamb skin purse i guess all those designer bags will be donated to animal charities,NOT
yes this video is totally accurate and i agree with the whole idea but people saying that her first statement already destroys the myth does not make a lot of sense companies have a general idea that women arent as valuable so they arent hired as much,NOT
not hating but she posted sour cream and onion chips on her story and those have milk,NOT
if someone is too short to get on a roller coaster i guess they can say they feel like theyre ft tall and theyll be allowed on,NOT
only if social justism would pay as well as working at oil rigs,NOT
booom girl i love your no nonsense attitude snap you tell it like it is im a straight cis female and youre the bomb,NOT
do you know what gender dysphoria is trish,NOT
omg watch her make a fast food video tomorrow,NOT
jesus christ at least try and sound like a girl oh hell no,NOT
ok but you mentioned how the  to  statistic is just average salary and you said how women might typically take lesser paying jobs but you never specifically tied the two together,NOT
im so happy for you try some breaded tofu some vegan deli meats veganaise vegan butter soups and salads lots of pasta and sauce are vegan just check the label,NOT
i identify as woofwoof who is with me,NOT
transgender girls now they are adoloscent boys,ABU
k triggered feminists,NOT
women getting turned on by gay men is the same energy as men getting turned on by lesbians,NOT
trish hunny you just ruined and type of career you had not in a rude insulting way but you should take this down and collect more information,NOT
i wont be speaking in favour or against the wage gap argument but the methods used to compare whether there is a wage gap or no is idiotic at best its common sense to not use averages how about you take two people of the same profession working the same job in the same company with the only difference being their gender and see how much they earn per hour and not the total wage per month and then repeat that process over and over again with different jobs and companies only then can someone say whether the wage gap is still present or no,NOT
thanks i needed to find the truth for my speech,NOT
voice is really nice and easy to listen to,NOT
this is very funny,NOT
this video missed the information about women who have never been married actually earn a bit more on average this is known since the s at least according to michael sowell,NOT
ive vegan for a month now and i had my first small piece of chicken today i have no idea why and now i feel soo fucking sick ,NOT
shes trolling guys dont believe her,NOT
gurl  bye  i cant  trisha baby girl pls we all know you are trolling and its getting out of control because its starting to get offensive,NOT
this is why we need to get rid of sexism what trisha is saying is literally just sexism with all the gender identities these days people are getting confused,NOT
can you do a video about marina,NOT
now there is wage gap for men ,NOT
how tragic and wrong what if usaine bolt decided to identify as a women how rediculous i think ile go identify as a horse and enter the kentucky darby,ABU
oh shit i must be trans too i gotta tell my boyfriend,NOT
and if you want an amazing burger from trader joes they have a veggie tikka masala burger and it is soon good and also try chipotle sofritos love you,NOT
the fact that gigi said trish wasnt trolling,NOT
people think im weird for hanging out with guys no sis that aint it,NOT
this is beyond a freaking bruh moment i dont even know what to call this the bruh master himself is stumped,NOT
i agree luv trisha but im finding myself slowly moving away from her with all do respect if she truly is with i think she isnt at the moment transgender i will support her unconditionally but using the trans community for views and attention is never okay and it is something trisha is prone to doing jumping onto trends and saying random ass shit for views xyz but at the end of the day nobody defines the transgender every body is different and responds to figuring themselves out in a different way there are male to female straight women male to female gay women male to female a and the exact same for female to male she has every right to come out but definitely has no right to use being trans for growth it truly can be either or we all know nothing is yet to be confirmed i know this is all over the place but i just dont know how to explain my opinion in another way than this in conclusion well see,NOT
if vegans and carnivores are really interested in my health then they should perform more clinical trials in which both diet forms are included,NOT
so the conflict between the left and the right is the cause of a misunderstanding thats shite,NOT
these are boys dressed as girls dna will always show their gender is male,NOT
biologically unfair af,NOT
is there any valid argument in existence that can actually prove there is a wage gap because from where im sitting grade  math where you learn meanmedian and mode can easily solve this myth why is this dead horse still being beat,NOT
sooooo im sorry if this comes off as harsh or offensive to trisha but how many unattractive girlswomen say they are only attracted to gay guys hundreds of thousands millions billions honey its a very old ploy no different than the ugly middle school boy who has a girlfriend who lives in insert foreign country here or the  year old male virgin who is only attracted to super models and he wont settle for anything less its all bullshit its a coping mechanism or a defensive posture taken by people who dont just want to come out and say why wont anyone fuck me and thats fine i guess but just admit that to pull this i think im trans bullshit is offensive and harmful get over yourself dear,NOT
so can we officially cancel this mess,NOT
sorry trish youre not fooling anyone,NOT
nice to hear a coherent and nuanced discussion on the subject for a change they usually end up spouting such nonsence as women earn  less than men for the exact same work because patriarchy or run for the hills the feminazis ar coming,NOT
trish saying that she couldnt eat chicken after watching those horrible videoswhy took me back to the time when i couldnt eat fried chicken for a month after watching the movie the loved ones the i got put off again after watch excision shudder,NOT
i identify as a helicopter,NOT
shes no longer vegan can you do a response to her newest video freelee the banana girl,NOT
guys yall know how much i love my mom trisha but gurl she just posted a snapchat of her eating chicken and waffles agh,NOT
oh man the vegan community is so mean i hope you dont fail because they will come for you hard good luck,NOT
times trisha paytas identified herself ,NOT
people need to stop hating one another just because people are transgendered or different everyone should love every one we are all human beings and we only get one life instead of hating people we should start embracing and loving one another ,NOT
dear trish i also come from the eating disorder and believe me since i am vegan   years  no bingeing no vomiting  nothing the guilt feeling is totally gone my advice eat loads raw fruits in the morning so you feel awaken and dont need coffee anymore smoothies are great  dates and bananas will give you so much energy and later at whatever time you care for cooked food vegetables rice grains or potatoes  whole foods dont binge and overeat but eat as much to be satisfied  weeks in very little dont worry if you gain pound or two the weight will come off at some point if you eat well i eat mostly whole foods but i eat junk food still around once a week or even more sometimes and i am keep on loosing weight anyway it is a slow process but worth it cause you dont think about the food  anymore work out but do not overtrain yourself even a walk is better than nothing watch cowspiracy earthlings forks over knifes and any other documentary you come across on yt there is a new great one called swine   they will help you make an ethical connection they work on your subconscious so you wont have to force yourself to stay vegan  you will effortlessly stop craving animal products  so it will be very easy to stay on that lifestyle last tip if you make a mistake and eat something that had some animal product in it like milk etc dont beat yourself up learn from it and move on and dont listen to people that will criticise you for what you are doing youre amazing brave women and i support you completely fingers crossed for your journey to last longer than just this  weeks i hope you will feel fabulous and change your life like i did loads of love and support from london  xx ula,NOT
blair i just want to say a few things one i didnt know anything about you until i seen a video you did about yaniv when i seen that video i started watching a lot of your other videos you opened my eyes to transgenders and it is solely you why i am able to accept the transition and why transgenders do so at first i was afraid for my daughters using public bathrooms for fear of them seeing a man urinating in a urinal because of you i realized that would probably never happen and it alleviated my fear and it grew acceptance in my heart when you denounced yaniv which was my worst nightmare as a mother of three girls i instantly respected you for calling it out and how much you went out of your way and even put yourself in danger to hold yaniv accountable i fell in love with you because of that not love as in romantic but love as in the way i love my family and children i have agreed with you on every video you have done including this one i love candace owens and i agreed with both of you but i had to admit you held your own with her which is hard for a lot of people and you eloquently stood firm to your beliefs thank you for being you and explaining yourself and your thoughts the way you do in my eyes you have paved the way for people like me who dont quite understand the transgender transformations to understand and even able to lovingly accept everyone you are truly a lovely woman and keep shining your light and love to the world,NOT

the gender pay gap is a myth as proven by the video women desire a more balanved lifestyle more than men men are more likely to work more and harder therefore they get more pay also if your employer is paying you less than a man thats illegal so why dont we see millions of lawsuits every year for discrimination,NOT
maddox said it better,NOT
if i identify as a dog could i win best of breed,NOT
why do you think that women gravitate toward industries such as social services and education perhaps it is because those jobs facilitate child caring duties it is undeniable that the majority female children are raised to see their mothers taking the lead in this regard to the point that even on an unconscious level careers can be influenced by the structural demands on women the disparity between women and men is not just on an income level,NOT
you can eat beans rice any veggies flax seeds etc its actually a pretty easy diet but it takes time you just cannot eat or wear anything made from animals you cant wear leather btw but you can eat anything that is not an animal product good luck,NOT

i think trisha is trying to figure herself out maybe not the best wayright way but i can tell shes conflicted with her internal and physical self hope she figures it out,NOT

im not saying that trish didnt make this decision for herself but we all have to thank freelee for this well done girls both of you x ,NOT
my tips are definitely to educate yourself watch documentaries what i eat in a days vegan youtubers etc many of the documentaries are on youtube and netflix and for food wise eat stuff that will keep you full i didnt do that when i started out and just binged like crazy male sure to still get your protein and carbs and all that good jazz and also some things that i didnt know was that theres such thing as an accidental vegan foods what again research it and figure out more about these things and ignore the haters girl stay strong so proud of you this is probably going to be the most healthiest decision you could ever make,NOT
in the video the myth of the gender wage gap it explains how even though might be a wage gap for women to men it is not large as most individuals believe it is the first time watching the video i was convinced that the wage gap may not be a big deal although going back to what we have learned in class especially in the lecture from monday we learned how the wage gap is very noticeable christina hoff mentions good topics to prove her point the one that struck out to me was if women get paid less why dont business just hire women they are less cheaper hoff has a strong stance when she explains how feminist individuals are not implementing important factors such as hours worked positions and education when they are calculating the wage gap this convinced me that the wage gap might not be as dramatic as people think it is after all these factors are implicated in the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real it shows how adjusted measurements will be made to increase the possibility to use statistics for the wage gap women have a lot of responsibility and some even say more than man for the majority of women they are the ones in charge of picking up their children and taking care of their necessities like appointments and activities such as sports therefore all this responsibility has made women take fewer hours in their jobs or not work at all it is hard to conclude a solid stance because of what both side of the wage gap leave from the leader presentation we learned how clearly women do not make the same as men although from the video once other factors are entered it changes things so when will we receive the actual unbiased information  in american household men make more money than women therefore most women work part time jobs or do not work at all if men and women are working the exact same job hours education capability and there is still a wage gap then more things should be done to stop it but only until the statistics are true in this country i believe that women still have a lot more freedom to make their own choices than in other countries,NOT
this right here is why everyone thinks the us is a laughing stock seriously you cant win against the men so you take over the female sport youre not brave youre not anything but a delusional man how can this be news  its ignorant at its finest you can take all the estrogen in the world but you will never be a woman youre just a handicapped man fuck you fuck your feelings,ABU
how come this waitress makes less than her lawyer boyfriend explain that why she makes k a year but her boyfriend makes k a year,NOT
so its incredible retarded that this philosopher who works in a shitty university comments on a topic that she clearly knows little about as an economist let me comment on a few things  yes businessman are making a monetary loss whenever they do not hire a women with lower wages since they could potentially lower their labor costs however as gary becker pointed out long ago a rightwing economist who is a nobel prize winner if employers have both some monopoly power and distate women they can get away with discriminating women given that the forces of competetion wont work properly  the same basic result applies whenever the reality deviates from perfect competition for example whenever there are search frictions in the labor market or in other words when you have to actually spend time searching for a job which is the case in real economies  different career paths may not be choices or voluntary whenever there are gender restrictions on in certain occupations as there are in many places in the develiping world whenever an occupation is overly seggregated or whenever discrimination caused an unequal distribution of math test scores for example women cannot really choose to be an engineer if they face a gender gap in math to begin with  of course women work less hours and thus are promoted less ever heard of the glass ceiling as men why because domestic work is unequally distributed and women bear the whole burden of domestic work in most countries of the world if we had some policies to socialize care work as there are already in place in many developed countries then the gap in market hours between men and women would diminish substantially all of this is not either common sense nor a leftist conspirancy its just good science,NOT
just here to dislike the video have a good day ,NOT
high end high demanding lawyer firms struggle to keep women as their employees because women usually marry someone of equal social status and higher they often have a husband who makes about the same as they do plenty of money these are jobs where the firm calls a top lawyer at  am in the morning to solve an issue for a company that would otherwise cost them millions and the lawyer gets paid  dollars  hour for that and what happens only the men are crazy enough to keep doing that and the women resort to a less demanding lawyer job,NOT
oh no honey what is you doin ,NOT
old video didnt stick to your word shut up mspiggy ,ABU
wage gap discussion tend to gravitate around these facts but shouldnt the real discussion be around what drives us toward these choices in life if were being taught into specific roles values and norms from the very young age these will surely have an effect on our career choices young girls who have technical parents  role models will more likely statistics aim for technical field girls who dont have these role models are more likely to go into the fields society media culture etc advertises for them what stops women from applying stem degreescareers isnt really an effective question now is it the same logic applies for boys and men too of course edit the points in this video are facts yes,NOT
if you want protein go for beans soy satan chickpea falafel amazing with hummus and fake meat if you want good luck,NOT

finally a channel that actually makes sense in this world,NOT
i love it when i see the left eat its own it never fails,NOT
women work part time a lot and the people that do these statistics count them as working in the same place but dishonestly do not include hours worked because that would destroy there pay gap narrative cooking the books one might say,NOT
ballshit i work with two girls i have the same hours they get the same money,NOT

oh my lord this better not be a joke,NOT
why are we even paying attention to trisha paytas all her vids are just attention whoring or a cry for help,ABU
trisha is garbage sidenote i just noticed youtube unsubscribed me for a second time from your channel,ABU
trisha dressed and acted more feminine than  of the people i know irl regardless of gender or what they identify as maybe trisha is trolling or maybe trisha is more gender fluid than they realize,NOT
i have never taken into consideration the gender wage gap that seems to exist today so when the discussion came out during of our classes i was most definitely caught off track and honestly bothered in the youtube video there is no wage gap it gave us a bit of sense of why men are paid more due to education occupation position and hours women are paid  in comparison to every  that a man makes women are seen to have to juggle being moms with responsibilities inside and outside of work basically women are viewed as weak the video made it seem that women arent as capable as men when it comes to working long hours especially at a last minute timing women however are not weak i know that they do take more responsibilities than men when it comes to their children but just because women are capable of taking on more roles doesnt mean they should have to face a wage gap when it comes to education i strongly believe everyone should be paid equally yes people get paid more for their seniority at a job but that is due to them having worked their way up there either by being their for such a long time or simply because they do their job right and get promoted in the end everyone should start off by getting paid the same in any career they have the youtube video and the reading we had assigned for homework sheth and gould  includes a graph and tries to use that the excuse for this wage gap is due to women choosing low paid college majors leading to low paid jobs in a sense i see how it is true women go for ore of the motherly careers and i think thats how we women are seemed to be this gender wage gap does exist and some of its reasons provided in the video seem reasonable in the end however the wage gap shouldnt exist no matter the circumstance,NOT
vegan movement is the greatest social and ethical movement in st century ,NOT
i love vox,NOT
the sadest part of this video is a woman saying this isnt sexism its common sense,NOT
yassss trish you will love it just research the shit outta it and youll realise how fucking amazing it is ,NOT
every time you put out a video i lose my shit over how pretty you are,NOT

protein  bean almond milk etc oh btw you need to buy traditional yeast to not get sick if your going vegan good luck  xoxo,NOT
you may not like vegetables but to keep a diet like this up and doing it healthily you need to start to eat vegetables and just deal with it or youre not going to be getting all the vitamins and everything else you need by just eating fruit and that im not saying this to start a riot but its the truth,NOT
im so proud of you but as a vegan you need to eat carbohydrates  rice potatoes chickpeas beans exc  also dont think that a vegan diet is just fruit eat enough calories and have fun ,NOT
yes im so proud of you i hope you stay vegan,NOT
there was another study done sorry im going on memory so the specific name of the study is gone in which they determined that women are less likely to negotiate for a higher rate less likely im sure there might be some yeah but not me so youre wrong replies les likely doesnt mean allofthewomen this could easily explain any remaining  gap,NOT
no this was so painful to watch you are not transgender,NOT
i encourage you to visit or speak with someone who can educate you on this,NOT
trisha desperately wants to belong to a community i dont understand how gigi is on her side surely she should be highly offended,NOT
this is such a positive step well done both of you ,NOT

i watch both youtubers but trisha was eating chicken and waffles today ,NOT
well heres the thing if my theoretical husband and i wanted to start a family it is more likely that i would be the one taking time off after the baby is born there is stigma that if a new mother doesnt take the time off for her baby she is considered a bad mom however if she does take the time off to care for her new born she is considered not hardworkingdedicated how is that fair i agree with what this is saying that the wage gap is a myth in the sense that if you do two different jobs with different pay then yes there is a gap but there are still ideologies that hurt women from going into fields like computer science etc for example i have a friend who works with computers and fixes them however she is always questioned by customers about if shes doing it right or if thats really the answer even though she is one of the top techs meanwhile a coworker who is male who is in a lower position is hardly questioned by customers about what hes doing so yeah the wage gap may not exist but there is still a stigma that prevents women from entering these fields or stigmas that give them a hard time in the fields,NOT
it would just push me to run faster um how fast do you want the girls to run youre still a dude dude,ABU
if youre into beastiality you can find that hog on pornhub she does nude videos for her patreon people no idea who the fuck would pay for that,ABU

i never hit the like button so early in a video,NOT
this is a stupid subject like most any left subject they should have a class for only transgenders that would be the only fair thing to do otherwise they are descriminating against women duh,ABU
i would like to call myself a feminist its not to say i want equal pay for all i want equal value of life for all the wage gap is as explained in the video reliant on so many variables i have most knowledge in norwegian studies about this where we have  of mens pay mostly because of not willing to work longgraveyard shifts pregnancies prioritising family over ovetime the difference in pay if you work for the private or official sector and people under  tend to earn less than their peers no matter the gender there is still a big gap though taking the electricians in norway as an example with the same age education employer and work hours there is still a gap of kr usd per month studies by official statistical bureau of norway i am waiting for them to find the reasons for that,NOT
no hair and no makeup makes you lazy not trans trish love you blair ,NOT
waits for the apology video,NOT
this is not our world it is every living creatures world,NOT
its still an indiviual problem if you get less money its because you earn less it dosent matter what your gender is,NOT

someone should run a business but they hire all men for yrs then hire all woman for yrs just to prove a point,NOT
do you even understand what youre talking about like are you processing what is coming out of your mouth,NOT
i wish this mentioned the fact that women also disproportionately care for children an average of almost  of their careers since its easy to see how women would make almost  cents on the dollar less,NOT
not only does a wage gap exist but it is engrained in our culture explaining them away as individual choices ignores cultural pressures and child development one study i performed using multivariable calculations showed that the gender gap amongst college professors was non existant however simpler mathematics showed that higher paying universities hired more men than women and the higher paying colleges amongst those universities employed more men than women also the states that payed higher wages to college professors tended to hire more men than women this study took into account tenure education title publications age etc it was a small study but it did show a significant wage gap according to gender,NOT
a great youtuber to watch to get started with veganism is rawvana she even has some playlists on how to go vegan for a week and some tips for beginners her journey is amazing,NOT
her thumbnail looks like vegan porn,NOT

you can thank marxism for this,NOT
as someone actually part of the lgbt community a gay man all i can say is shame this is not us we do not own this dont think that all of us are like this cuz thats not true at all shes just a tom boy and everyone knows it ,NOT
i love her ,NOT
what um  child anyways  so,NOT
im so happy for you just eat when youre hungry and stop when youre full substitutes for meat and dairy arent the best things for you but they definitely help with the transition two weeks may not give you a ton of results but it is a start anyway just try getting a lot of fruit and veggies and watch a few vegan youtubers for some recipes you can make just about anything vegan,NOT
of courseexplained by a feminist,NOT
cant stop rewatching this amazing film,NOT
but this is trash and very stupid insensitive and unfair why do females who turn to male not partake in male sport i guess we know the answer to that because they cant keep up the way our bodies are formed are very different and that wont change even if they refuse to acknowledge the body in which they were born into their own sport should be made they still retain their muscles and a whole lot of other stuffs that is the composition of a male body its a big disadvantage to people been born female ,NOT
yaaaasss go trish so happy youve decided to try the vegan lifestyle really hope it works out for you,NOT
good job trish,NOT
i like cake,NOT
you mean sex gap,NOT

so basically women just dont have the mind set to work out of there house and their just lazy or to weak for more serious jobs that requires men,NOT
im glad and kinda surprised you didnt immediately jump to sexism as the primary explanation refreshing,NOT
yay trish holy shit yayaya,NOT
i dont think most people commenting here watched the video they seem to be upset even though they agree with what was said in the video,NOT
all of the people that scream if they say theyre trans believe them are the same people saying fuck you trish youre not trans in her comments lmao,NOT
me had a crush on a gay guy in middle school doesnt wear makeup despite zits and tries to appear confident and strong cause gotta have that big dck energy despite not having a dck also me well apparently im trans now my braincells screeching in the background trisha is a sucky troll not even a good one just an offensive one,NOT
i am sure she is particially right but i assume gender gap is due to sexism too lol she is probably chosen to deliver this message for sexist reasons,NOT
hey i enjoy your videos what is your sign,NOT
umm wtf did i just watch,NOT

funny how when chris jenner identified as a women everyone was all kissing his ass and made him women of the year but here you have two black men who identify as female and all the sudden its unfair lmao wonder if they were white they be getting praised,ABU
i believe people shouldnt be offended by trisha doing these things even though she has a big following and a priviledge of that power i highly believe trisha makes these videos as a therapy out loud thinking she just says what she feels and she doesnt know or care about the consequences because thats for later to face she loves the attention and doesnt know how to balance her issues,NOT
dudes cant play against girls and they are doing that,ABU
its really a dilemma i think its about making sure the two trans girls are included socially etc with other girls while doing their sport but its also about fair play my best suggestion of solving the dilemma is making an open female group in which cis girls and trans girls can participate  a group only for cis girls maybe they could compete together but when the results and medals are announced the girls would be separated in a result for the cis girls group plus another result for the open group,NOT
trisha you need to get dates,NOT

thats amazing good luck,NOT
i kinda relate with this also i dont see anything wrong with this people just wanna take the piss out of trish coz she reacts,NOT
when there are indisputable facts already out there that the wage gap is very real ,NOT
vegan actually can eat anything theres anything vegan  so just go for the logo if you want milk or egg or even meat,NOT
black bean burgers are always great for the summer and got protein eat lots of leafy greens for iron make sure to take a b supplement if you go fully vegan because you woulf most likely need it animals are made to eat b it comes from the ground so when they are slaughtered its in the meat almond milk or soy milk are the best,NOT
thats the best video intro ever,NOT
thanks so much pbn for spreading the news veganism is a big change hopefully people would change and understand from watching the film,NOT
im exited for the video where she shows what to eat because i need it for me,NOT

scary part is female issues never get resolved until it starts affecting men i dont see how this will affect men so i picture it being a long time for these schools to get their st together i doubt they even care they prob like the recognition of having the fastest female runners nothing against trans but its obviously not fair,NOT
freelee youre great,NOT
thas the problem we accept this bs,ABU
how does this have  dislikes,NOT
i actually thought tricia was mtf trans when i first saw one of her vids im not gonna lie lol,NOT

i dont give a flyin steroid who you arethose are not girlsfuckin freakssociety needs to check into a mental institution,ABU
ik this might be a stretch but why do i feel like she always does extra or controversial things when shane starts a series or puts something out idk i feel like shes just the biggest troll ive never seen her as a genuine youtuber she literally reminds me of a white peaches,NOT
im glad you say things how they are without being worried to offend anyone in the pc world i mean she can say she is a carrot that doesnt mean its so and we are supposed to say its okay because she has a right to say it your the only one that isnt scared thank you ,NOT
wtf is this monster at the start  ,NOT
the video was prerecorded she was eating fried chicken on her snapchat a few days ago,NOT
maybe check out genderfluid,NOT
freelee is going to be ecstatic,NOT
what a man can do a former man can absolutely do better,NOT
there are older nb people that actually have dysphoria but besides that i agree ,NOT
i thought your salary except government depends on your negotiation skills,NOT
pls dont delete this this is an important issue,NOT
this video is hella problematic transphobic homophobic the whole shebang,NOT
her lips look like she got stung by a bee,NOT
maybe you take advantage of your gender choice just like your skin you are acting like its harder for you but the truth is you get nothing but special treatment earning nothing karma will catchup when you get aids tho dont worry,ABU
whose gonna tell her that not all straight guys are that masculine and admire women,NOT
there is no wage gap there is an earning gap because there are more women in lower paying jobs like nursing teaching etc because that is what more women choose to do,NOT
so the wage gap is true in certain cases but not to extent weve been told,NOT
when there is a blogilates add before freelees video,NOT
these guys are actually geniuses theyre taking advantage of the over openmindedness in this country,ABU
oh my i never thought id see the day i saw something sensible as a youtube ad the day has finally come to spread sense and reason to the masses rejoice for the time is finally upon us that facts may finally win the day,NOT
this is one of the best things that ever appeared in my recommend sub earned,NOT
to the guys saying career women shouldnt have a family or get pregnant if they want the same wage then you guys would be fine if all the women decided not to have your babies until they turned y old right or if they decided never to have sex until they wanted to have a child w you which meant youd have to be in a committed relationship cause it seems thats the only option women are being given,NOT
what wage gap there is none,NOT
and to top this video off in  the equal pay act occurred making it illegal to pay a gender less because of their gender but the left wing retards still choose to ignore this,NOT
guys this video is true to a point please watch the vlogbrothers they are more specific and are probably true just watch all the perspective,NOT
you ever gonna mention race,NOT
i love prageru,NOT
such a heart touching message,NOT
your first question in your video is easily answered you cant only higher  gender its discrimination,NOT
thank you freelee for your impact on the world ,NOT
be sure to eat lots of rice and potatoes will fill you up there are recipes all over the internet,NOT
romans   one person believes he may eat anything while the weak person eats only vegetables the bible is the way of truth on that we were given by god himself to eat meat and are allowed to eat meat so i will always eat meat with thanksgiving and no longer a vegan or vegetarian but a meat eater the difference is that i only purchase quality meat over quantity or overlyprocessed meat still on that journey genesis  original statement but god does allow eating of meat so please stop it with the vegan hate speeches that one man went a bit insane their killing this their doing this we like meat sue us,NOT
dude i dont like prager but this video kinda true doe,NOT
and they teach the pay gap myth in school and pretend its real,NOT
aint that some shit  youre still a dude shittt,ABU
thats a man with a dick,ABU
the gender pay gap is a myth no women will get paid less than a man if she does the excat same work and hours,NOT
can we see the face that created this beautiful video and channel  youre a big stepping stone in the revolution,NOT
but if i pretend there is a gender wage gap for same work done changes might be made that mean i get paid more or work may get easier so why not promote this debunked myth if its rejected i lose nothing but if its accepted theres a possibility of easier work andor greater reward im not being played on for my credulity im being smart by pulling a slot machine for free nothing to lose everything to gain,NOT
what youre describing doesnt really sound like transgender because you arent fully identifying with a certain gender sounds more like you are gender fluid or nonbinary transgender wouldnt be the correct term,NOT
ive been vegetarian for a year now and pretty soon im gonna start a vegan diet and freelee was a big part of my decision as well as kalel cullen and all of those videos make me absolutely sick and i hope pretty soon a lot more people hear the message that the vegan community is putting out,NOT
i feel bad for the real girls that spent their whole school career competing in female sports hoping to get a scholarship from all their hard work only to have it ripped away from them in their last year by someone that isnt a real girl beating them taking their st place finish away from them colleges look at numbers not circumstances all these new age transgenders want equality but dont seem to care about the equality their stealing from others in the process my guesseventually real females are just gonna give up and not compete at all whats the point in it when theres a  ringer in the midst,NOT
the people making the claim who are stupid they do not know the difference between wages and earnings there are very very few companies paying different wages the majority is min wage how much your earnings are depend on how much work you do in hrs at the wage you are on,NOT
what that feeling is called is wanting views money and controversy this so awful to people who are really deeply struggling with actually transitioning,NOT
take attention if almost of the people on the world decided to stop eating meat was a disaster for the nature because the natural animal leather was completly replace for sintetic leather made with petrleo qumical components please see on youtube how sintetic leather is produce  they want sell sintetic leather or vegans leather how is know on world market,NOT
you just take a woman who works a job and a male who works the same job same hours same number of days same number of raises and compare their pay,NOT
is it fair are you fin kidding well is it fair to all the real females,ABU
yesss girl get ready to glowww,NOT
femenists always wanna blame men for their failures,NOT
next week shell be on t,NOT
dont you know in vegetables there is an micro animal called water bear and yes its an animal so vegan isnt real thats a fact,NOT
notice how there are no biological females competing on male sports teams just because they identify as men,NOT
i love meat and i will always eat meat in the future,NOT
are we just going to say that women get paid less than men even though in  out of  of the wealthiest cities in america women make an average of  percent more than men this statistic kinda destroys the whole argument that there is sexism not to mention women on average work fewer hours additionally women are less frontal so in a job like a business they would probably not be very good at it for the reasons you said and others business would be a terrible job option for women and to say that is due to sexism is ridiculous because of a male babysitter makes horribly less money than a female one yet no one chalks that up to sexism men will do a worse job when it comes to caring for children just like how women will struggle in jobs that require force its all biological yes women can display force but biologically they arent forceful vox fortunatley took a factual approach to this and not just outright saying that sexism is the reason as i have seen people do in the past but saying that women jsut need to blanket get paid the same as men are stupid we need to look on a more individual level try to find a women who does the same exact hours as a man has the same experience has the same job and does literally everything the same as the man and she does the same level of quality as the man and i guantee you she will get paid the same amount unless you look at another statisctic which states that women are  less liekly to push for more money this is alos led to a gap not because of sexism but due to bioligical inscurities,ABU
trisha isnt going to transition her vagina makes her money on snapchat  shes dumb af,ABU
the population of the world is becoming more psychotic by day these two guys like to dress up and mimic mardi gras drag queens their speech is an act their mannerisms are an act their hormone replacement therapy is an externally introduced artificial enhancement the word transgender is a nonsense in regard to boys feeling they identify as being girls cate blanchett recently acted the part and identified herself as being bob dillon however at the end of the day when shes no longer acting shes still herself cate blanchett,ABU
the reason women start making more as they grow up is because they are growing up and spending more time at work,NOT
trisha just wants to be anything but herself even a chicken nugget ,ABU
thank you every year stronger and stronger united for the animals the planet and our health,NOT
will pewdiepie be on there about the subscribers gap,NOT
theyre being so fucking selfish its not even funny they have the bodies and all the advantages of being male even standing next to any of the girls you can see a very very clear difference to paraphrase they basically said if i were in there shes id be happy for me like i get you want to be supported but when dozens of girls have practiced their ass off to compete to have a pair of boys take first and second place thats bullshit pick up art or something thats not inherently easy for you dont fucking like these two at all,ABU
cough cough china,NOT
i might feel more sympathetic if they werent so smug they are basically smirking the entire interview because even they know it is bullshit,NOT
are you blaire open for recieving fanart and including it in merch,NOT
its kind of funny how people are entirely missing the point of this video men are not doing their fair share of unpaid labor child raising tasks and chores resulting in women being forced to take jobs that dont have strict schedules while encouraging women to go into higher paying fields that dont have strict schedules is a bandaid to a chunk if the gender gap ignoring sexual harassment in male dominated fields like tech but that is a whole different issue that still doesnt get arround the fact that women are doing more than their fair share of paid and unpaid labor so we need a cultural shift toward men who actually act like parents,NOT
i think youre looking for the term gender fluid ,NOT
i would love to do this as a business communications presentation in class but then my professor would hate me,NOT
i think her ex and his friends made her so ashamed of being a woman and made her so ashamed of who she is that she has become so confused about who she is without them i think she genuinely thinks shes in the right mentally but she is not getting good guidance and she needs therapy i dont think she knows you have to have dysphoria to be trans maybe shes gender fluid maybe shes just ashamed of who she is either way her friends really need to help her right now,NOT
whilst true dont blatantly read off a teleprompter makes it look bs,NOT
no wonder this video has almost  million views its true af,NOT
when you dont wear makeup and therefore you identify as a male,NOT

ive watched these for the past three years i always learn about something i missed and am filled with hope by what i see every year theres been progress  will be a great year for veganism our world depends on it,NOT
or you idiot it actually represents different choices made by men and women on average you know that thing that becomes more and more obvious the less outside forces affect outcomes its why you idiots never talk about the scandinavian countries where the gender pay gap is most pronounced  because every single fact runs counter to your dumb narrative,NOT
 as a brazilian i thank plant based news for raising the awareness that the amazon is being destroyed by the meat industry,NOT
dont eat bananas theyre not very healthy,NOT
this is ridiculous its not about right or wrong but fairness i dont want to make life harder for trans women but bio women are always cowtowing to men then to add insult to injury now these empowered biological female athletes have fight for a fair chance to participate in a sport which often times their teams are not as well equipped or funded as male teams these trans woman have decided they are on equal footing as biological women which is not true or fair the more i think about the more insulted i am i dont want to hurt anyone feelings i haved dated trans people but biologically they are not the same trans women have an unfair advantage im sorry no i wont watch or support events that allows them to compete against biological women we as women need to learn from the trans community and unify fair is fair,ABU
look on pinterest for vegan recipes theres lots of them ,NOT

this whole video invalidates trans people fuck trisha paytas shell do anything for attention at this point,ABU

and the primary solution to so called man made climate change is cafos they are causing far more pollution and damage to our environment than any amount of c let alone a few points change on current levels  the c lie is just simply appalling,NOT
trisha youre amazing best of luck to you girl,NOT
none of this will matter when the robots take over,NOT
didnt you say you thought you were black too  whats next you gonna think you are a horse  trapped in a trans man gay black female ,ABU

wow i cant believe men are better at being women than actual women hows that equality working out for you,NOT
i never comment on youtube videos but this is too much i have been out as a trans guy for  whole years and i almost killed myself because of the people around me and how they were treating me they have gotten better because they understood and  years later some people still dont i work for respect everyday and this could take some of that progress away youre not a guy please stop,NOT
hey trish congrats on going vegan  theres lots of protein in nuts and some vegetables if you find that you arent getting enough protein theres vegan protein powder that you can find in some places and make sure you eat enough calories,NOT
if that would be true all men be doing babysitting rather than work,NOT
what is a fact you might ask a fact is a antonym to a feminist argument,ABU
sunflowers brazil nuts quinoa and lentils,NOT
also peanut butter and toast is amazing as well buy some avocados too avocado toast is delicious and you can make some guacamole and still enjoy some chips and salsa with it try trader joes too they have many vegan wraps and burritos that are super yummy and a great onthego meal also whole food has  vegan chocolate pudding love you trish and good luck,NOT
i am not sure why so many people arent into this its all just straight up facts,NOT
i understand getting teased and bullied for things you cant control as a kid and how much that can affect you and how you see yourself as an adult i think more than anything you need to go talk to some people therapists that deal with identity and you need to really talk to trans people i understand you want to speak your truth but im not sure that you know enough or know who you are enough to talk about this this openly,NOT
even with this video theyll find something to nag about the so call pay gap myth ,NOT
they have the edge against their female counterparts if they want to compete they should advocate for a league on their own lets stop calling apples to pears,ABU
as a leftleaning individual i can say that this is a very welldone video this kind of content is exactly why i subscribe to prageru and would love to see more of because it uses facts and research as opposed to anecdotes to challenge a particular view it could only be made better if they were to cite every claim they make and link in the description so we can follow up on them there are certainly other videos by prageru that do make me suspicious of the source and i feel a better argument could be made if those were cited leftleaning because id rather not identify by party because neither side is  correct on everything and to place that label on yourself is to put yourself into a box where you feel pressure to defend your ideologys world view as opposed to your personal world view,NOT
lebron becomes transgender and goes to the wnba yeah that will be fair,NOT
she had fucking sour cream and onion chips on snapchat today,NOT
it is not right they are not girls and are not able to be traced for doping because they can easily stop the female hormones and gain an edge thats the issue they also have male brains and theyre dopamine levels are totally different from girls their fight or flight is different stature is different they arent competing with all of the female characteristics that make women a bit slower compared to them let them compete but it needs to be a fully trans team we wouldnt have able bodied people in the para olympics because they feel disabled right so im just saying  at the end of the day they are still chromosmallly boys soon to be men living as transwomen wear what you want  present yourself how you want love who you want no issues with that but this is not fair at all hell we even make sure kids of certain ages cant compete against certain groups in schools we just need trans teams and then that will be fair just my opinion nototransphobia yestofairness,ABU
me after watching season  of rupauls drag race but in all seriousness tho i am a cis woman who dresses masculine because i am comfortable being a tomboy i am not trans i do not suffer from gender dysphoria which i believe is what you need to have to be trans i am a woman who is happy being in a womans body but i like mens clothes as much as like womens trisha obviously does not know the definition of transgender let alone how it works,NOT
a balanced video  people still offended,NOT
 i dont get theythem pronouns its to confusing  whats confusing we dont wanna be called a guy or a girl used in a sentence i was hanging out with name this weekend they kept making jokes about politics so i kinda just let them be i dont mean to blow up but really that is almost as burned out as your non binary so your what an attack helicopter,NOT
hi i just ran into your channel and wanted to say my opinion do i think trish is transgender no now if she was doing to progesterone shots and doing surgeries then id say yeah but just because youre attracted to gay men it doesnt make you transgender i think she need serious professional help i love trish but jeez shes a mess,NOT
i feel hungry when i see fish i enjoy eating shrimps and squid while they are alive is there something wrong with me,NOT

i would like to go vegan some day when im older cuz im only  now and i may go vegetarian to vegan but when im like  years old,NOT
well then tell vegans to stop breathing and farting methane,NOT
i cant like this video enough,NOT
i understand that a lot of the gap can be ascribed to choices made by both men and women but i think it is important to consider societal attitudes which discourage women from aspiring to careers in highpaying jobs and especially stem fields and push them toward softer more traditionally feminine career paths,NOT
tht thete isnt one,NOT
the best parts of blaire whites videos are the bitch factor cause everyone she talks about she always has some sassattitude about them  i love it,NOT
youre going vegan but dont eat vegetables lol what are you gonna eat rice and beans everyday,NOT
sushiiiii and also sushi and falafel wraps and sushi and burritos and sushi,NOT
i noticed that females lead jobs that help other people just something i noticed im not trying to be rude about it not sure if it takes less education but psychology takes a lot of schooling so im not sure the common factor,NOT
if women are paid less than men then why do business even hire men in the first place companies will want to minimize their production costs so why would they choose one source that costs more than the other for equal work id say theres more to this story also theres a bunch of jobs that are always highlighted where men get paid more where do women get paid more,NOT
didnt see this one coming,NOT
whos idea was it to allow them to compete in female category typical man syndrome ridiculous bang out of order,ABU
im not particularly a vegan but i do enjoy the vegan diet and vegan products that being said i know you really like toast so i recommend buying the vegan butter that is at trader joes honestly so much better than regular butter,NOT
hey trish im also a new vegan but i have some experience as ive been a vegan for a few months now i eat a starch based vegan diet rather than what freelee eats raw till  basically she eats an all fruit diet until  pm an then she cooks a vegan meal for dinner and shes made countless videos on what she eats in a day definitely go check them out personally however what i find to be more sustainable is a starch based diet that a lot of vegans thrive on heres an example of what i eat in a day breakfast mango smoothie i eat a smoothie for breakfast nearly every single day i freeze bananas and mangos and put them in it for a cool and creamy texture similar to icecream lunch three small brown potatoes with and asparagus broccoli and cauliflower medley i typically put a tomatoey sauce on top or sometimes barbecue sauce if im looking for some nice tang dinner basmati rice and black beans with an avocado sprinkled with granulated garlic i usually combine the mixture w tomatoes red onions and lime in addition i have a bit of salsa on the side snacks i only eat fruit for snacks remember to carb the fuck up if i were you i would stock up on rice legumesbeans fruit and vegetables whole grain breads and pasta and vegetable stock also try lots of lentils and stuff like quinoa the recipes are endless also cauliflower is amazing and is good for a lot of vegan dishes i find the most of mine on pinterest its amazing remember that you must eat in abundance on this diet and stray away from replacement items like daya cheese however if you crave those items spend the money on a vegan pizza every once in a while you will make mistakes but just remember to forgive yourself this is no temporary fix however if you want to see true long term results you must continue on a beautiful diverse whole plant based diet since my vegan transition i have lost the excess off of my stomach and see it being a lot flatter in addition my skin isnt perfect bc i do suffer from acne but it has become much more manageable and has cleared up tremendously throughout this journey you will see body results but it also teaches you how to love your body and also a lot about compassion i encourage to keep researching the vegan lifestyle and motivate yourself to continue love you trish good luck on your vegan journey,NOT
vox is so cute lol they think this is true just because they used cute pictures,NOT
proof that bullying works,NOT
im just gonna let this here and hopefully you will read this sorry if my english is bad  obviously there is a lot of hate around you and your channel so i was really septic about you i didnt really know what to think but recently i have been watching my eating disorder story type of videos on youtube and i have noticed that most of the people who recovered were now vegan and a lot of them mentionned your name i just wanted to say that you really earned a lot of my respect as eating disorders are a really touchy topic for me you literally saved peoples life and that is beautiful so yeah maybe you are called bitchy and stuff about your videos but lets not forget that you helped a lot of people  love xo,NOT
im gay for blaire,NOT
terry miller sucks  is his m time thats honestly terrible mines is  as a freshman,NOT
its just a medal ok i keep comin in third cuz these  dudes keep beating everyone on the girls team for some of these young ppl sports are everything and make a major impact on their futures there wouldnt be a damn team every parent should pull their child out let them dudes run against each other create a damn transgender team lawd imma start identifying as a transwhite woman im done this shit is a complete circus,ABU
gotta get into that burgeoning field of blimp piloting ladies,NOT
oh look at that you had nothing to say about you being a troll ,NOT
freelee i love when you do a what i eat in a day  d,NOT
on her closing sentence she looked and sounded very confused why didnt they reshoot,NOT
da fuck they look like men with wigs and girl clothing lol sheesh,ABU
am i trying to spread awareness for trans equality  but am i telling someone else theyre not transgender cuz why not ,ABU
this is just a feminist channel now un sub,NOT
btw you should eat lots of fruit like raspberries blueberries black berries and cherries,NOT
list of things to eatricebeanspotatoeslentilspasta oatmeal mac and cheese and many more things,NOT
i never thought id see this day i am so proud of you for doing this trish this is so healthy for your body and i hope you stick to this for good from one vegan to another good luck,NOT
this channel is the greatest thing ive ever seen,NOT

aaaaaaaaaaaaah this is vodka btw effin dead,NOT
this is why u shouldnt be on youtube this is the outcome a mini stroke  viewer discretion is advised,NOT
if you want to know how to eat order freelees online book the first version she put out is free meal plans inside,NOT
god damn i love you ,NOT
i like this video but i do wonder about when she talks about the choices women make when it comes to job choices because in the highest paying jobs listed women are less likely to take them because of the discrimination and expectations they face so when i look at it they present an illusion of choice that it is  womens choice to not take those jobs for the most part this is a well presented video but im just thinking about that so maybe its not only a wage gap problem but also the gender disparity in fields of work,NOT
trisha talks about the lgbtq community like its a highschool club that shes not allowed in,NOT
trish dont watch those videos slaughter house vids freelee watch farm to fridge link in the description,NOT
you cant work fewer hours more predictable schedules less dangerous jobs pursue lower paying careers sacrifice more time for children or other aesthetic reasons etc and still expect to be paid the same as a man who sacrifices family spends more time at work pursues more dangerous higher paying jobs is able to focus long stretches of time at career and spends less time with family remember women have higher rates of depression and suicide in similar careers as men that proves theyre biologically less likely to pursue higher paying careers,NOT
i hope no one actually believes anything on this channel,NOT
i am so happy for you going vegan even for two weeks is a great change i am so proud of you for being open for such a big change on your diet since you are going vegan you have to eat a lot bigger portions of food dont be afraid to eat more than you used to beans and chickpeas are a great source of protein you can find many vegan recipes online have fun,NOT
so moral of the story is believealltrenders not on board so not waiti wear makeup every day does that make me a drag queen,NOT
good luck trisha  i been vegan for almost a year now,NOT
anyone else really confused  i feel like shes not finishing full sentences,NOT
take me back to precolumbus america please lol,NOT
isnt it a huge problem that the  out of the  worst paying college majors are all based around directly helping vulnerable or disenfranchised people counselling and psychology early childhood education human services and community organisation social work sure i guess you can say women should pick better paying routes of education  even though people are naturally drawn to certain fields from their own interests and experiences but to me its more important that the people choosing these really noble fields who are disproportionately women should be getting payed more this is valuable work and it should be treated as such,NOT
you dont know who trisha is stop acting like you do make your own damn content stop using other youtubers for clout,NOT
i put the blame on the school,NOT
didnt freelee make a video just for shane dawson to try vegan foods did he just ignoring it ,NOT
subscribed for this logical content ,NOT
it does exist here as well i live in an oil producing arab country as an example a female english teacher would earn about  dollars per month a male arab teacher would earn about  per month both have the same college degree they say it is to encourage more men to become teachers men also get about  increase in their salaries for every child they have so if a guy has  kids he would get a  increase in his salary the women however get nothing a man can apply for a government house if he is married but a woman cannot he gets about  dollars for getting married and they say it is to pay the dowry so if he marries  wives which is still legal here than he would get  dollars and if he has  kids from each wife he would be a millionaire i dont even want to calculate anymore,NOT
my mom n i started our transition to vegan this year it was so sad to me how at  my mom got a big bag of meds everytime she went to the doctor her ac was  she was basically a ticking time bomb now shes on the  range n feeling much better i lost my grandma last year to diabetes n my uncle past away at  couple years ago i will do everything in my power to end the cycle n nutrition its the key,NOT
please choose kindness  i cant stand watching animals being slaughtered anymore why do you continue the violence you have an alternative choose it choose to be kind,NOT
thats awesome great for you  i guess you could make a mukbang eat veggie grill ,NOT
just shown this video to my feminist mother she stopped the video after  seconds claiming that its propaganda,NOT
 i did not know vox was feminist  search of but my wage gap,NOT
theres multiple factors when it comes to wages like different bosses education levels how long you worked there and even what college you went to plays a factor its not your gender that dictates how much pay you get,NOT
its amazing how easy it is to brainwash people massive amounts of vegan propaganda the past couple years crazy how people dont realize that this fauxgrassroots movement is a government deep state int bankers tactic to facilitate depopulation truly disgusting and despicable,NOT
what happen to samuel jackson,NOT
no matter what the truth is rather she is now or not i just love that freelee has calmed down a bit and being nice to momma fishy ,NOT

this just spotlights the hypocrisy of this agenda they always speak about how we are the same but physically we are different these agendas dont care about fairness just about being right,NOT
if i asserted myself i wouldnt be a bitch id be the man i see trisha made it to track  of lover and decided she felt that shit real deep,NOT

i really love how freelee is there to help trish love this ,NOT
sounds like shes pansexual and gender fluid,NOT
this is simply false,NOT
ive been vegan since i was  nearly  years ago,NOT
i think the root of the problem is not the pay gap but the pressures and norms of women to be in the types of jobs that pay less and men in the types of jobs that pay more so there is an inequality but the root problem is in how we raise kids and even subconsciously push them towards different careers society shouldnt discourage men and women from jobs just because its not normal for their gender,NOT
i come back here once in a while to like the new hate comments xd,NOT
men are also more likely to ask for a raise,NOT
i identify as schizophrenic,NOT
can u do as much videos as u can so we can see ur progress thanx also do a ur diet plan a wat u have been eating and the amounts one tip i do know apples help burn body fat good luck trish u have inspired me to do the same good luck to the both of us,NOT
even with  years of hormone therapy they will have larger lung capacity more muscle mass more power they are male regardless of hormone therapy regardless of surgery regardless of anything a steer that has his testicles removed at a week of age is still stronger that a heifer a gelding that had his testicle removed is still usually more powerful than a mare it is biology and nothing is not going to change that,NOT
adam and eve needs to stop sending trisha dildos shes gotten out of hand,NOT
clear concise and honest thank you,NOT

what happened with your instagram page,NOT
she was  drunk,NOT
im very interested in this topic because the wage gap in chile where i live seems to be a very popular theme i am wondering if you have any relevant andor statistic information with regards to chile or south america is this only a myth in the usa or is it a myth in other countries as well,NOT
i feel like she is being sincere and is trying to express how she feels but has phrased it really poorly like really poorly maybe just further education into this matter could help,NOT
queen of telling the truth,NOT
it would be far more authoritative if they would cite the studies they reference from which aauw study are they finding that info what was the study from the usdol where did they get the nursing study from,NOT
the thumbnail is so obvious lmao,NOT
second hand retardation hitting me hard rn,NOT

lmao everyone hopping on the vegan train,NOT
dont know you i have never watched you before but yall need to calm down people go through a processes  it took my transgender daughter  years to finally commit and know who she was for sure the difference is that trisha is doing it on social media in front of the world its like when peopel who were bi had to be harassed by gays and lesbians for just being gay and not wanting to admit it sexuality and gender are spectrums and we all shift along that spectrum even when we finally know who we are trisha if your using the community step off if your finding your place and identity stand tall,NOT
hair length doesnt define your gender,NOT
lies gender equality is already a thing propaganda,NOT
why is this so boring,NOT
vegans are the most stupid peoples in the earth,NOT
the incredible thing about this video is that it promotes making hours more flexible to accomodate mothers  needs but never questions the basic premise that it is up to women to take hours away from work to look after the kids  im deeply disappointed vox furthermore why does your only solution seem to be in the increasing liberalization and deregulation of businesses like pharmacies is this really the only way forward ,NOT
this is so perfect,NOT
honest question though are you against identifying as nonbinary because thats the vibe im getting from you,NOT
thank you thank you thank you i love you guys heres to another great year,NOT
i think she is trans a trans psychotic woman,ABU
until women want to become doctors instead of sell makeup and hairdressers in the mall there will always be a wage gap,NOT
check out raw vegan not gross on youtube her chili recipe is freaking delicious ,NOT
some dumb segment,NOT
she was doing it for a music video but she has finished that video since this video so i dont believe that she is vegan anymore,NOT
and now everyone is hatin on me,NOT
fiance pay a ton its because the men dont hire women,NOT
feminists antivax and flat earthers seem to do the same thing purposely misinterpret info pick the only article that supports them even when theres  that say why they are wrong and try to pull the uneducated or look at these obviously fake statics and pretend they are right,NOT
maybe men are just better than women at providing,NOT
men work more hours men make more money mystery solved,NOT
trisha says she hates animals,NOT
im sharing this film on my facebook watch channel because i believe in downloading and sharing crucial information ive been vegan for  years you have my support ,NOT
i havent watched the entire video yet but thats great trish im happy for you eat lots of whole foods like fruits veggies nuts and legumes and youll be healthy af,NOT
they dont have an unfair advantage the estrogen has made them feeble,NOT
it should be bigger than tesla beyond meat go for it,NOT
this is so true,NOT
lol please freelee look her recent video and make a video about it,NOT
as someone who was the president of my middle school gsa has not and will not transition has never personally known a trans person who has actually transitioned i whole heartedly accept trish into the trans community,NOT
i am not sure if prager u is conservative or neutral though i am fine either way because i am conservative and i agree there is no wedge gap,NOT
the issue is not that women are paid less its that we value traditionally masculine jobs more than feminine ones teachers nurses and caretakers are seen as less valuable than engineers scientists and other masculine careers ultimately both women and men should have the freedom to choose a career without having to think of preserving their masculinity or femininty we need both men and women in teaching we need both men and women in engineering we need both men and women in the military we just have to work together,NOT
dont they hormone boosters or some shit ,NOT
trish i am smiling from ear to ear i never thought i would hear you say the things you did dont just do it for two weeks do it for life i went vegan three months ago and ive lost  pounds i feel amazing i have never felt better in my life make sure you eat tons of carbs rice pasta potatoes ect im vegan because of freelee i hope after the two weeks that you stick with it for life   much love xx,NOT
after i was like a man blah blah blah sis,NOT
i feel so awful for the girls who are losing to these cheating boys how many years after title ix i hope they win their lawsuit and these losers are forced back onto the boys team,ABU
cant wait untill female sports will be dominated entierly by males ,NOT
so one has a gay father and a transgender mother both of them look like boys in drag this why the trans community gets push back these biological boys with hormone additives shouldnt be competing in a race with biological girls,ABU
you tell that to my mom please cause she knows for a fact that men in the same position that she is in earn more,NOT
its totally misleading to not take into consideration the impact of motherhood on women career jobs with long hours  no flexibility are not compatible once you have a kid and you are responsible for it super biased,NOT
the wage gap doesnt take into account choices between the genders a wife nagging the husband to take on another job and the fact that women get pregnant and take a break for a year or so,NOT
hit up especially the hollywood farmers market make sure you are getting enough calories too have fun with it  go to one of the raw classes at plant food and wine in venice maybe take b  im a very new vegan so im learning too im trying hclf,NOT
if you choose to fully go vegan and take on the lifestyle youll have to use faux mink lashes get rid of your fur no leather vegan a cruelty free makeup i hope this goes well for you  i recently went vegan and in  weeks ive lost almost  pounds yes i get so many good calories and protein and ive never felt happier about myself ,NOT
i have a transgender niece boys are stronger than girls period rewriting the rules for a ridiculously small percentage of the population and robbing biological girls of the opportunity to compete and win against other biological girls empathy is important and my niece struggles and it breaks my heart it is wrong period,NOT
i figured it out  apparently  is  less than  my male math says that should be ,NOT
cant you do porn instead,ABU
lmao thats why u were eating eggs and bacon on snapchat,NOT
a great video but there will most likely always be a wage gap because a man who works longer and more often should get payed more than a woman who doesnt and vice versa,NOT
tisha just stop talking stupid joke is over,NOT
youre selling a t shirt with multiple images of your face on it wow your ego is off the scale,NOT
i just hope she doesnt gain weight due to metabolic damage and then call it quits,NOT
watching those videos is important people dont know what they are paying for xxx,NOT
holy shit you cant be serious,NOT
guys you really didnt get the video its mostly saying that the wage gap isnt real or at least something not to complain about because it makes sense how do you people get the idea that this is a feminist video,NOT
i went from a pescatarian to vegetarian to vegan best decision ive made,NOT
please be a joke please be a joke please be a joke,NOT
for all the hate people give social libertarians they have made liberal sjws back way off on the stridency of their discrimination claim regarding the wage gap now instead of a patriarchal conspiracy we just get a video complaining that women get to play with the kids more and have a more balanced lifestyle for a tiny bit less money progress towards the truth is slow but it appears to be real,NOT
gender wage gap but  i thought gender dosent exist isnt gender a social construct lolcant make this shit up,NOT
trisha is a troll,NOT
in order to close the gender pay gap make the total earnings of women the same as mens  youd have to stop women from having babies so being that the only set of countries where this lunacy is being pushed is western countries whats being advocated will result in the end of the white race  not to mention laying the precedent for communist equality of outcome society so in short end of the white race and communism  and the mainstream media is pushing this out in the west you should be asking who owns and controls the media and why would they want to bring about the end of the white race and introduce jewish invented communism,ABU
this is absolutely amazing im about to show this to my mother in law shes a feminist nut job this is a debate weve had many times thankfully prager u has the patience to explain it lol,ABU
im glad you brought up masculinity and femininity not being gender itself im  and biologically male but at one point when i was  i was often being bullied for being too feminine and i got so pulled into that that i thought being a trans woman would solve all my problems but looking back now im happy that i stepped out of that because i would be depressed and regretful thanks to other men i learned that it was ok to be male and have a feminine side so again thank you blaire for bringing up masculinity and femininity,NOT
id dress as a girl and go on a date with her if she dressed as a guy,NOT
im lesbian but cant be with a woman sexually  trisha and now trans  girl stop lol,NOT
love that she assumes that every single gay person is transphobic and would refuse to date a trans person nah fam,NOT
trisha is an attention whore plain and simple shes not the only one who makes videos and post like this but she does this type of crap for the clicks and attention,ABU
lol reminds me of when gerard way from my chemical romance says hell use hethey pronouns on twitter a few years ago and people are still saying that makes him trans although he identifies fully as male and literally no one he knows irl ever refers to him with any other pronouns than hehim sounds legit huh,NOT
if women want  equality they have to start working in the sewers be the one picking up trash build houses and work on oil rigs they cant just take jobs were they are leaders of big companies and countries its not all sunshine and roses over at the male department,NOT
lets see how long this lasts,NOT
 minutes in and youre cracking me up blaire ,NOT
one variable that i dont see discussed very often is negotiation i started a new job recently and whilst going through the application process the company made an offer i thought i was worth more than that offer so dug my heels in and negotiated i ultimately settled on a wage that was  above the initial offer its quite possible for two people with identical qualifications doing a the same job and even recruited at the same time to be getting paid differently just because one was prepared to take a risk and negotiate whereas the other just took the initial offer put on the table studies have shown that men are on average more likely to negotiate when an offer is put on the tableprobably because men are bigger risk takers and this could certainly explain some of the residual wage gap after things like qualifications experience etc are factored in again  negotiating or not is a choice people make if you chose not to negotiate can you really feel aggrieved because you end up getting paid less than somebody who did,NOT
ugh u make michael jackson fans cringe,NOT
i dont give a frick,NOT
most prageru vids are about politics usually things i dont or at least rarely agree with but when its not about politics i love these videos,NOT
its easier than ever to go vegan theres so many resources and products out there now to help you there is no reason to eat pig butthole,NOT
man this subject is so stale these days,NOT
hallo there here is a plant based whole food eater i dont own a car and i ride bicycle every where and currently i am specializing on integratinging solar cells to buildings so since we established that i am an environment freak i would like to say that greta is a indoctrinated and manipulated poor girl and some of the claims that she makes are just so wrong and very annoying,ABU
watch my video on veganism just to show a different opinion,NOT
a lot of people use this explanation as an opportunity to be complacent in preventing workplace inequality its fine that women are paid less because they take care of their kids sucks for them such is life in reality workplaces should be child friendly in that they offer support to working moms working moms are citizens too and should have equal opportunity in the workplace they shouldnt be punished for yielding a new generation,NOT
can you do a response video to hugo from the channel formerly known as the bible reloaded channel next,NOT
tf she talkin about,NOT
ok so if she wants to be a gay man can we just afford her this status then as like a peace offering or something,NOT
if your born with a penis your a man same goes for women and vaginas,ABU
the well being of the children should triumph no one wants to be transgender believe me,ABU
if we really care about gender equality then why focus only on the wage gap theres an employment gap a workplace fatality gap an education gap a mental health gap and an incarceration gap,NOT
the gender wage gap doesnt exist there proof that it real,NOT
your cat is so adorable,NOT
i havent seen the new video yet but omg shes lost it i agree if she actually were trans she would not be  ok being born female,ABU
i feel like shes a suuuupppppeeeeeerrrrrr confused gender fluid person,NOT
yay finally not some bullshit feminists,NOT
hey freelee can you tell us if bulletproof coffee actual works for weight loss,NOT
your hair looks so soft,NOT
if they have the same job they should be paid equally simple as that,NOT
how about paying more for caringtype jobs but no thats socialism understanding people and appreciating a broader skillset that doesnt directly produce goods,NOT
men risk more and work more hours they earn more because of that there is no reasonable or moral reason to force emoloyers pay the same to women who work less and take less risks,NOT
if women make the same amount of income as men why do companies insist on having you sign a nondisclosure of wages agreement,NOT
another good video from prager university,NOT
if a man takes anabolic steroids to alter his hormones its unfair in a competitive sport against other natural men so what about a transgender man who takes hormone therapy to compete against other natural men what about a transgender woman who takes hormone therapy to compete against other natural women,NOT
i just cried,NOT
i agree if she is okay with her physical gender then she isnt trans and does she have wig rash ,NOT
xx xy divisions that easy,NOT
this has been going on for years the william sisters have controlled tennis for years they are men,ABU
woah the comments look new didnt notice,NOT
when i was vegan i missed sour cream and onion chips but i found vegan ones they are called earth balance sour cream and onion chips and theyre vegan and let me tell you im obsessed with them,NOT
i like how the wage gap doesnt actally exist lmao,NOT
thank god someone is correcting the liberals,NOT
thats me like saying i identify a handicap person so i should be able to compete and crush in handicap sports,ABU
i want to see all those feminist faces who are spreading lies in the name of equalitythey must be burning,NOT
i had to skip the greta part she is just being a pawn for adults and is just cringe,NOT
shes just trolling calm down lol,NOT
is trisha transitioning to a black woman,NOT
dont forget the farming of soya beans in the amazon,NOT
this comment section is fostering a lot of bigotry yes physically these girls have an advantage they are probably taller have more muscle and a more masculine physique allowing them to run faster its a frustrating thing to look at on both ends since these running competitions have very real consequences to things like scholarships and awards but to exclude to trans girls who already have it tough is a difficult thing to do i really see no solution,NOT
please stop drawing out the last syllable of every word and you need that informationnnn if you want to start closingggg the wage gapppp,NOT
congratulations trisha a big mistake vegans make in the beginning is nor eating enough calories plant based foods are much lower in calories so make sure youre eating enough eat carbs with your veggies so you get full beans nuts seeds tofu and whole wheat are all good sources of protein,NOT
when i read the title i thought she was joking and was going to poke fun at vegans lol im really surprised shes going vegan even if its just a diet,NOT
ill be trying the raw till  im curious to see how this makes me feel and how much weight i can loose from it ive tried raw vegan before for two months and i had a really hard time with it because i didnt prepare my self and my kitchen with all the things i would need plus i didnt have the will power when going out with friends and family when i said i was raw vegan everyone looked at me as if i had  heads and then i got oh dam poor you what will you eat then etc etc lol any how i want to give it another try and see how it goes this time,NOT
thank you great video,NOT
please we dont eat only eat fruits eat beans rice  potatoes lentil and lots of fruits and veggies theres also some junk food vegan food so it wont be such a hard transition try gardein vegan eggs sea weed theres so many options  also dont forget your vitamins b supplement is a must maybe buy a vegan supplement ,NOT
this video wasnt terrible you actually acknowledge that women gone into more less paying jobs than men and that they are more likely to stay at home with their kids instead of staying overtime at work i honestly expected this video to be garbage but it was actually decent,NOT
the best part is that a woman says this,NOT
ive never seen freelee so happy it makes me happy,NOT
hard hitting documentary,NOT
where i work at in my department we have seven men who are all doing the same job none of use are making the same wage some of us have more seniority than others some of use have more experience than others and some of us simply produce more money for the company than others factors such as this always effect how much a person is paid even if you are doing the exact same job and ladies i am going to tell you something and it will probably upset you so you might want to sit down it just might be possible that guy at work that is making more money than you is simply better than you at that job gasp,NOT
im vegetarian and one thing that i absolutely love is beans and rice i cook black beans in jalapeo juice and mix them with plain rice its amazing i have it twice a week because its so good,NOT
from my understanding of this video its the fact that women are expected to have worst paying jobs and are expected to be home more,NOT
cough propaganda cough cough,NOT
there is no wage gap rather an earing gap,NOT
ill be sure to avoid fake meat made from mold,NOT
examples that cant suit every case of inequality you gather different studies to make them saying something that is accorded to your thoughts and so many people do not see that apparently this is the lack of criticism in your minds just a guess ,NOT
she needs to do her own research on nutrition and food and shes not,NOT
too many bullies commenting she isnt trans but she obviously doesnt know what being transgender is she just sounds confused either that or shes a troll just trying to get famous using controversy but that would require a level of processing she really doesnt display here so its kind of hard to say hard to wrap my head around someone her age being this oblivious about gender and gender identity,NOT
not really fair beautiful women but its an unfair advantage,NOT
just eat till your full dont stuff your self protein can come from seeds like sesame seeds and stuff like that i watch mommy tang she is vegan but she makes korean food and she says a good diet is eating simple plain simple makes a good meal,NOT
hahaha she came out as black lol love it what a freak ,NOT

i once debated this with my wife she afirmately said that the gap was from the same job in the same company then i explained her that it is a general data and asked her two things  are you willing to find a job that pays  less but have a well diversificate work hours so you can take care of our son  do you think that the avarage women would choose to sacrifice her wage for the family i didnt heard the answer but she moved on to another subject how the society dictates the role of the women,NOT
sorsha needs to see this,NOT

dang it this vid was klickbait and did not feature any new informations to me so over here in germany the gender wage debate mainly focuses on jobs suited for men that do not allow women to be women in the following way my scienceteacher originally never meant to become a teacher she had an extremely well paid job in a laboratory now guess what she eventually fell in love and wanted children well children or career,NOT
so proud of you,NOT
trisha was born a man,NOT
to all the feminists who hate the usa why do you live in it,ABU

vegan mukbang please,NOT
im an even prouder fishy yay make sure to also keep dancing and working out to help you on your journey,NOT
trish i just dont get theythem also trish uses they to describe a singular person in the same video,NOT
ill believe trisha is trans when she makes an effort to transition which will probably be never,NOT
yassssss momma fishie welcome to the vegan club,NOT
sitting there listening to the boys father call him a girl makes me laugh hes a weakminded man thats why hes growing a troubled son that thinks hes a girl,ABU
personally  the video doesnt impact me i know who i am the main issue that i feel a lot of us have  especially transguys like myself  is that this video will open up a whole bunch of more issues the video could promote more people assuming that they are perfectly okay with being their biological sex feeling that they are trans because they feel masculine at times and unfortunately this could lead people to transitioning then regretting it all of that aside  im sorry if my english is awful  blaire  you are just amazing and i love your videos drinking vodka should be youre intro,NOT
its just a bandwagon for career politicians and militant feminists to leap on to,NOT
you didnt include sex work industry  female these women are making lots of money off men and still enjoying what men have to offer,NOT
in her newest apology video she claims shes had these feelings since   or  years old ,NOT
its also way more complicated then this clearly biased video is showing,NOT
wow  i did not expect to see a rational examination of this issue from vox pleasantly surprised to see the wage gap isnt because of the sexist patriarchy as some would have us believe,NOT
make k im male what about muh wage gap or how a woman in the same job gets  percent less pay but gets more health care coverage,NOT
they dominated because their men you dont get it grow your hair out take some hormones grow some tits then run down the track with your dingdong flopping all over the place youre a man in a womans event  if you want to compete in the mens event dressed like a woman then thats fine thats where your fight should be but no you dont get to compete in a womans event when youre a man whether you feel like a woman or not,ABU
i agree with the general conclusion of the videowage gap is not mainly due to sex but more about choices however there is still partial effect  lets say  due to the fact that some managers  could be women dont prefer to promote women to execute positions due to prejudice and stereotyping from personal experience wage gap is more apparent due to racial and religious differences rather than sex,NOT
literally her video is just saying that shes trans cause she doesnt want attention from men then why tf did you get gargantuas sized tiddies sis,NOT
i love this channel and seeing the ignorant thumbs downs lol,NOT
aaaaand let the shitstorm ensue,NOT
eat jalapenos on everything spices starts your metabolism,NOT
youre fascinated with trans people so is this like a trend a hobby of yours youre sick,NOT
id rather support someones life rather than a stupid game of a sport,NOT
the fact that women are worried about that or men for that matter is showing that no one seems to be able to look beyond the scam of the monetary system and swallow it like sweet cake instead of questioning this malevolent system governments are happy with these kinds of debates that means their product still works,NOT
omg yes trisha im so proud of you ,NOT
i choose to identify as a male ,NOT
lol rome is going to implode on itself when certain boundaries are broken the system is going to collapse i look forward to it then out of the rubble is the time to conquer and take over a dysfunctional society and show the way ,NOT
wtf do you mean you identify as a gay man ,NOT
just because a woman is talking it is does not mean that the lies you call facts are more true,NOT
i love being in the lgbtq community lgbtq communitywho let her innobodydid she sneak in again,NOT
you are literally garbage you are so disgusting for this you are cloutsexual b eing relevant turns you on and you are a fucking fiend they and them is confusing that sounds plural fuck off you fucking actual troll you deserve every negative comment you get,ABU
honestly was my favorite an the best one so far ab trisha coming out  straight facts,NOT
i like how women born in the mid s had close to earning parity with men maybe that had something to do with all the men being killed in some sort of war or something,NOT
the mens bags of money were bigger in the thumbnail,NOT
i thought women were equal to men,NOT
me normally am i trans yes  me around my extended family do i identify with my natural born gender ,NOT
ive always found this complicated attempt at explaining the wage gap through choices and other factors to be pointless the problem is so much simpler comparing medians just isnt a useful metric its so wellknown that it has a name simpsons paradox for all we know women actually get paid more than men for equal work and the effect reverses when taking a median due to this statistical phenomenon tldr medians tell us nothing in this situation period no need to explain why the discrepancy appears with choices hours worked college majors etc,NOT
they should form their own transgender track meets they arent being fair and they know it sick,ABU
its great that your going vegan there are lots of delicious veggie meats veggie burgers chicken nuggets hot dogs ect all meatless pasta with tomato sauce and veggie meat is really good some asian restraunts have really good tofu and almond milk is really good theres vanilla and chocolate and a less sweet one theres also vegan ice cream ,NOT
incredibly powerful film worth enduring its shmarmy commercialism in deference to its portrayal of a lifestyle that can make a significant effort at reversing our careening to collective extinction that commercialism is formulaic and seen all the time especially now just before xmas but tolerable here because of the end it portends,NOT
am i the only one who actually understands what shes talking about,NOT
you should watch mommytang  channel she teaches how to make a a vegan food its really good try go watch her ,NOT
really glad this has so many views and positive comments in  weeks this means the tide is finally turning away from the sjws hopefully theyll be a myth in a few years,NOT
girl u didnt talk with your mouth full,NOT
my teacher decided to lie to my whole class and say that the gender wage gap is real now im changing schools because i have a bad teacher and need a better education that doesnt include all this drama on feminism and liberalism,NOT
that cat looks like he hates trisha too p,NOT
being vegan is actually quite easy and you can still eat amazing foods  lots of pastas and rice and potatoes french fries you can still eat out and eat lots of great food for protein beans and quinoa and seeds etc its actually much easier and you can eat much more than you think and a vegan diet definitely wont make you loose weight unless you diet believe me ill eat black bean burgers with asparagus and garlic mushroom pasta with vegan pesto potatoes fries rice and beans etc if you want to lose weight diet if you want to be healthy gp vegan,NOT
this essentially dismantles the years of work women have done to fight for their own athleticism giving titles and records to males in womens sports is regressive and i cant believe that this is actually being debated i am  against this dont  me,ABU
k people who rated this video are radical feminists,NOT
women get to spend more time with their family they have better lives men work themselves literally to death is our goal to work more or spend time with family forget wage or earning gap and lets look at quality of life gap,NOT
lol do people not transition because they feel hyper feminine or hyper masculine masculinity and femininity have everything to do with gender i genuinely cant tell if youre just trolling in this vid or you really are this dumb to pick on other trans people and try and come for gigi by saying that shes not the brightest crayon in the box no disrespect to gigi tho bitch wtf you wear the same black outfit in every fucking video,NOT
equal pay act of  and title vii of the civil rights act of  makes the pay gap illegal,NOT
f you dont think that by being man you are not gonna be more wealthy just take a look on average wealth by sexes,NOT
ok so gender fluid,NOT
they are straight up cheating getting easy wins against actual biological girls that dont have that physical advantage ifthey get a first place metal  its not because of skill but because they have male physical benefits zero excuse no logic fuck your feelings,ABU
coconut milk frap at starbucks,NOT
id like to have a long ass talk with trisha about how gender and sexuality works she needs to figure this out bcuz she seems so confused to a point shes saying strange things,NOT
i keep trying to like this video more than once and it wont let me,NOT
this is a classic example of stupid ideas running wild they are males competing with girls its unfair to all the girls competing trandgender idioigy its all about me,ABU
omg youre iconic for eating and bitching on your kitchen floor  is trish ok tho is she having an existential crisis or is she trolling btw her face looks so differentshes lost a lot of weight but thats beside the point,NOT

yes men are better at earning money then women,ABU
im vegan for over  years got rid of my acne gained kg of muscle mass and created my dream reality never felt better ,NOT
this is controversial i support the lgbtq community  but i do think it is unfair,NOT

and about pharmaceutical my friendgirl studied there hates it  left it,NOT
gardein has some really yummy easy foods,NOT

i love you trisha but i feel  trans but i feel  comfortable with my birth gender is a big big contradiction i know those arnt the exact wording but also it is completely okay to feel like you are both gender but that isnt trans i dont think i could be wrong i am a bisexual cis female who has a tomboy side im not in the trans world so i dont know if i am wrong by saying this i am so so sorry either way tho as long as you feel comfortable with yourself thats all that matters it doesnt matter if the label is correct it doesnt matter what we think all that matters is how you feel,NOT
not bad not bad at all good video,NOT
i love transgenders but that is so unfair,NOT
trish youre not basically a vegetarian i always see you munching chicken and bacon,NOT
this is obamas legacy the direct result of political correctness,NOT
thats amazing ill definitely being watching trishas videos now,NOT
why is everyone defending her like shes just shitposting duh i only see that she makes a big joke out of the trans community as if there wasnt still a long way for society to accept trans people what this wailing goblin babbles in this video is not exactly helpful,NOT
trisha always reminds me of a crack head she always acts like one xd,ABU
i wish they showed this in school instead of spreading sjw lies,NOT
a video with common sense good job,NOT
ughhh love you despise freelee,NOT
the wage gap does not exist,NOT
jason dated a boy,NOT
this is the crappiest youtube channel ive ever seen behold im your new liberal troll,NOT
what if this was the only way to get scholarships because they suck in the boys ever think about that,NOT
thank you for shutting feminist,NOT
this is insanity at its best if i was a parent id be outraged by how stupid this is,ABU
yes please make a video on what you eat daily those videos help me a lot ,NOT
just more problem factories packaging etc cook your own food so easy make your own milk crackers cheese burgers cut out the middle man and trash,NOT
the vocal fry at the end of each of her sentences made this impossible for me to watch with the sound on thanks for the subtitles though,NOT
im inspired know thanks for being very positive love you trisha,NOT
you need to eat pasta rice and potatoes too almond milk tastes the same as cow milk so have that with your starbucks,NOT
the profession of teacher arguably the most important in the history of the world is overwhelmingly dominated by women yet ive never heard a man complain of the fact its interesting,NOT
yes love you beans soy meats nut milks vegan cheese rice all these will help you transition to vegan food they are tasty and dont just start with only fruit because that is not sustainable for most people its soooo much easier than people think to be vegan  you have made a connection with the animals and you are a loving person and you want to be healthy so please stick with it you are making such a difference talking about this with your subbies bless you,NOT
people claim that its a myth and demand the statistics to back it up you give them the data and statistics to back it up and suddenly its asinine arguments like oh its really an earnings gap not a wage gap etc semantics im pretty sure we all understand the sentiment here the arguments presented in the video are still sound regardless of what you want to call the issue at hand and then theres the argument see its a lifestyle choice because of work hours it has nothing to do with gender cut the bullshit we all know women have historically been discouraged or forbidden from working in order to rear children and that this is still prevalent in our culture today it is a gender issue one thats so deeply permeated into our culture that people dont even recognize it because they choose to ignore the sociologicalanthropological reasons as to why this is,NOT
sweetie get your life together,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap there is none,NOT
you need brain cells first to lose them ,NOT
you can see how happy freelee was about a single person going vegan when i first found her channel i thought she was just overly harsh for no reason but you can see in her smile by one person going vegan how much she cares about animals,NOT
i honestly couldnt watch these videos from her like i tried to watch but like jesus christ i like trisha and have been following her for years at this point but seriously hunny just be you instead of trying to get all these lables attached to you all the time like daaaamn anyway i agree  to quote trish with you in this video she is just delusional smh,ABU
this is the most informative and inspiring film i have ever seen,NOT
i do agree in most of the video but theres a point that wasnt mention for a guy is easier to get most of the well paid jobs than a woman also uneducated jobs are mostly male dominated like construction or gardening theres a social experiment in which a boss was sent  cvs one female and one male in different professions most of the bosses including female one picked the male rather than the female as we have this patriarcal thought that male workers have more time or are more committed to their jobs also i come from colombia a country with a huge sexism in here is even illegal for women to have certain jobs,NOT
i really hope once women earn more than men like theyre doing better in school all the feminists start fighting for mens rights to earning and doing the same in education feminism is all about equality after all,NOT
isnt that remaining gap still choice the amount of hours worked,NOT
i call fakeif woman were paid less then why dont companies hire all woman,NOT
i think trisha is just trolling i dont watch her though so,NOT
watch rawvanas chanel she has a lot of great vegan food recipes,NOT
if these videos cant end feminism i dont know what can,NOT
so by trishas logic i must be a trans woman because i keep finding myself attracted to straight men how do i tell my boyfriend he wont want to date a trans woman  no offence to trans women,NOT
trish u should start your vegan diet and exercise more,NOT
i think you should just watch what i ate in a day from vegan channels also get an audio book on veganism like skinny bitch its awesome and i think it would definitely speak to you,NOT
baby carrots are not good for you  baby carrots are basically carrots cut out of bigger ones and then bleached so they arent that good for you,NOT
veganism is not a diet but a means of fasting you definitely need animal protein,NOT
daiya cheese is the best its really good on quesadillas,NOT
they should run with the boys,NOT
veganism is part of the satanic nwo depopulation agenda humans have always eaten meat and it has nutrients we cant reliably get from plants as a longtime vegetarian mostly vegan it was hard for me to accept but im transitioning back adding in animal foods and feeling better,NOT
you may not see so much change in  weeks because you dont know how your body is going to react to this new way of eating give yourself more time to see a difference vegan is a longterm solution not a shortterm love you trish hope you stay vegan,NOT
will i get a brain cancer after watching this movie  honest question,NOT
eat till your saturated not till your stuffed if you eat till your stuffed evidently your going to gain weight so happy for trisha ,NOT
so since i have a vagina im a bitch nowum ok trish this finna fire back on you ,ABU
they deleted your instagram,NOT
people should be able to do what they want but they have a lifetime of male testosterone musclar development and bone density that far surpasses the development the female body is capable of  even after therapy you cant reverse all of those traits completely  you cant argue they dont have a clear innate advantage  the question is what as a society are writing going to do about it ,NOT
what theyre saying isnt necessarily wrong just for the wrong reasons the pharmacy example is incredibly incredibly flawed and the flexible hours reasoning is as well,NOT
lying with pictures example  the gap doesnt go from  to  cents it goes from  to  cents why do they do that dont they have a strong case anyway,NOT
you should never do a video sitting in front of your fridge again you are looking like a midget,NOT
gurl you could eat a whole bag of grapes and youd be so happy who are you tryna kid xd,NOT
this dumb cunts who claim the wage gap are the very same who look for a man to maintain them financially instead of work themselves,NOT
is she ok ,NOT
please advice  so i am vegetarian and want to be vegan so badly i have showed them videos about veganism for sooooo long and i try to cut out things that i can they always do things so i cant be vegan such as when we go out to eat there is very little options and im young and picky and try to find things but they are so rude about it and i dont know what to do do you have any advice or anyone have advice im a huge fan freelee i love you,NOT
if you need some junk food for on the go check out target they have a whole freezer section thats meatless oh and if you get garbanzo beans and bake them in the oven with some seasonings delicious snack,NOT
borderline personality causes serious identity issues not saying she has is but if you look at the cycles it makes sense,NOT
thank you for this video,NOT
do i think im transgender yes a thousand percent do i identify with my natural born gender a thousand percent sis got the definition of being a transgender a bit wrong,NOT
basically the video is trying to tell women to pick certain jobs so they can keep rearing children how about we change the gender role behind child rearing and ensure that both parents pick up the tab so women can choose whatever career they like  just like men,NOT
i am vegan and love most of your postsvideos yet i am concerned this documentary will undo all the good done by the game changers fear based motivation is never as good as showing the benefits of change the first  minutes of gloom and doom extreme activists and the sad mad little icon of the hour greta are a big turn off to me and most people i know do you fly to the many conferences around the world you attend if like the environmentalist said we have had  previous environmental extremes that wipe out some species obviously they happened before coal planes trains automobiles and factory farming existed then who are we to be so egotistical to think we as humans are so significant our action or non action is going to stop the th maybe get back to focusing on the benefits,NOT
good job trishi will always support youlove you beautiful girl ,NOT
who is this trisha and whats wrong with her face especially her lips,NOT
so youre saying that the gender pay gap has almost nothing to do with gender but more to do with hours and times worked life choices and the profession chosen yes thanks for confirming what rational people already knew ,NOT
the reason is because they dont work as much as men men normally take more over time and less vactions,NOT
people we need to win the left they are going to destroy our civilization,ABU
yay i am so proud of you this is fantastic newsi it may be difficult at first but you are stronger than you think honey i believe in you you just have to retrain your brain and way of thinking every time you put your fork to your mouth i highly recommend you subscribe to the vegan mojo he offers alot of amazing helpful tips that will help you transition over to veganism you dont have to just eat fruits or lettuce he makes food that you would normally buy at a fast food joint but made completely from vegan ingredients you dont have to give up your love for chicken tenders burgers pizza tacos whatever you love to eat there is a vegan option out there just do your research but i wouldnt recommend following what freelee preaches honestly her diet is only sustainable if you are an athlete who exercise alot you will give up if going vegan if you stick to just what she eats you want to take baby steps and ease your way into this lifestyle because you do want to be in it for life if you arent eating the things you love and enjoy youre going to want to give up i know you want to do this for aesthetics but the bigger picture is to do it for the animals you know how those videos made you feel well it is the cruel reality of what happens every single day in the meat and dairy industry again yea meat tastes fcking awesome so for someone who has been eating it their entire life would find a vegan lifestyle impossible to stick with because they think they can only eat fruit and salads etc but it is not true at all just do your best and dont beat yourself up if you fail just start again fresh the next day baby steps ease your way into this lifestylebecause once you see how amazing your body is going to feel you will be hooked dont forget to drink plenty of water too best of luck sweetie i am rooting for you d,NOT

sis just because you hate your name and you like short hair better doesnt mean youre a boy cut your hair and chill for a minute,NOT
i hope she doesnt but i feel like she will give up if she doesnt see progression there wont be any progression because there is so much fat between organs she wont see any progression because all her efforts will first burn the fat that she cant see then her stomach fat will burn and thats why i cant see her going through with this because she wont see sudden progression,NOT
yes trisha im vegetarian and ive been working on going completely vegan i know what you mean when you say you cant eat meat anymore after becoming more aware that happened to me when i decided to make that change i hope that youll be able to stick with it,NOT

omg yay trish you go heres the biggest thing i found from going from junk food to vegan make sure you eat throughout the day dont let yourself starve for  hours then go to eat and be starving and willing to eat anything keep yourself fuelled especially if youre dancing ,NOT
ive been waiting for this video lmao yas,NOT
trish this is coming from one of your old fans and its just lay off youtube for a bit and try to figure out who you rather than going out everyday and making these videos because its sad to see you going through this and getting backlash for this just please its better for yourself and others,NOT
i have been vegan for only  month and i am confused where the hell i was before best decision ever ,NOT

that vegan couple made a video for you you should totally watch it and best of luck with going vegan girl make sure to eat filling cooked foods and not just fruit or youll feel so hungry theres tons of delicious indian and asian cuisine as well as awesome pasta dishes soups and vegan pizza finally if theres one thing ive learnt from going vegan is that banana ice cream is the fing bomb just google nice cream it will blow your mind,NOT
one of the only ads on this website that i didnt skip,NOT
thank god this channel exists because i was beginning to think universities are creating more obnoxious screaming social justice warriors who lack common sense,ABU
yay trisha  im praying it works for you  once you get past the detoxification phase of becoming a vegan youll love it and feel amazing,NOT
i really want to go vegan my parents dont agree with it though,NOT
absolutely they have an advantage they are male athletes running in female races,ABU
agree idk who none of yall are but she seems like she was born with a dick dont tell me she was born a female and you id say you were a born female and i think that is not the case  anyhow more power to you and you got it going on girl i dont see you being a bad actor i see you as   legit bio female  but she looks like a white rupaul who thinks shes blacklol that is all way too much for me to grasp and would have made a great twilite zone script but im way too confused now because of her maybe she lives on flat earth or something thats the only explaination that would explain all this  anyway thanks for your video keep sharing whats real and tell misster whiteish rupal to get a new job and stop posting this nonsense  the people watching her are confused enough as it is without her pushing puree on their brains lol but absolutely no lol at the same time antilol,NOT
maybe they should compete against more advanced female athletes but i guess thats impossible its seems that they would always be a the top of the sport,NOT
i think we can all agree that this is not as simple as companies dont pay women as much as men and i think we can all agree that if a company is intentionally discriminating against women something should be done about it but i think that is much more on an individual casebycase basis who cares about making the average full time salaries closer to each other that statistic means nothing as this video shows,NOT
i love you blair ,NOT
heyyyy im vegetarian but a lot of indian foods are vegan easily made vegan its pretty easy to make and theres a lot of leg room for error while cooking so give it a shot ,NOT
i agree they shouldnt be on a womans team but the nasty shit im seeing in the comments are utterly fucking pathetic,NOT

if the wage gap was real companies would only be hiring woman its odd to think a company would hire someone that costs more money but does the same quality work,NOT
im mourning the death of my last two brain cells omg you are a legend its  seconds in and im crying fromlaughing,NOT
the number of likes and dislikes on this video speaks for itself,NOT
ok people just because this video debunks the gender pay gap doesnt mean you can attack feminists,NOT
she sounds sincere but in  months or sooner will she go back her old eating habits,NOT
trish u always say you are going on a diet and how u are going to start eating healthy but then u give up and start crying on a video about how u failed at it i honestly dont believe u but i guess well see,NOT

brave of her to try to bring the yes im a vegan yes i eat meat meme back from the dead,NOT
trisha remember you also have to be active and exercise being vegan over time will drop your weight if you do it right but if not itll do the opposite  plus if youre really trying to loose weight eat the right portions just because youre eating a bag of carrots for ex per meal doesnt mean its good for you portionsexorcise and do it right  the first time i went vegan i didnt do it right and i broke out like a mf and gained alot of weight,NOT

yes they have an unfair advantagethey arr boys,ABU
finally now ill subscribe,NOT
freelee youre changing the world thank you i love you,NOT
im ashamed i gave a click to this shit,NOT
age gap doesnt exist its hours and choice of jobs just because overall and collectively gatherd woman are getting less money than men becausewell its simple more men are in higher paying job also its illegal to have a pay gap its simple,NOT
 wait so we need to feel sorry for women making k and we all know that there is an effort gap between the genders men tend to work more hours sacrifice more personal time to climb that ladder there is nothing stopping women from doing this and some women do and they are very rich but most women dont want to put in the effort,NOT
omg yay subscribed been waiting for your transition youre going to feel so amazing if you stick to this lifestyle stick to high carb low fat and overtime you will see amazing results its happened to me and i will never go back to eating any other way,NOT
the best channel  i finally found you ,NOT
shes trying so hard to stay relevant lmaoooo,NOT
many people are misinterpreting this video it doesnt say that there is no wage gap but it says that when taking other factors like pregnancies and different career choices into account it shrinks from  to less than  and  is still too much,NOT
blaire is serving looks in this video,NOT
the west is getting crazy every year,NOT
cowards who couldnt compete with men so they went to bully the girls,ABU
why is everyone a moronfeminist say that women earn less a hour doing the same job as a man does ex both work at a job earning  a hour and they all think women will make  instead thats what the wage gap is to feminists just fyi if you want to complain that there is a wage gap when youre a cashier and you compare your salery to a ceo of a company then that might be the reason why you work as a cashiercause youre a idiot,NOT
why more women can be like her,NOT
i know she seems like a troll in denial what goes around comes around lots of projection reading other people we read from our experience to form an opinion,NOT
well there goes the last pair of braincell i had this trisha is well i got no other word than special great video blair but sadly my brain cells went to the bank to get some fucks to give about trisha but got rejected because they are over there fuck budget and a now infuckingdepth trisha is a joke,NOT
to sum up the video im not like other girls,NOT
whole foods is your best friend,NOT
good luck trisha  i am vegan and support you all the way,NOT
actually in the homecare in middle east female nurses are sought after and paid more than their male counterparts but im not here protesting gender wage gap its a free market out there there is great demand and few supply for female nurses due to the local culture and tradition of islam of the middle east companies normally compete in the free market one cant easily change that culture likewise in the western culture youll be paid for what you could physically that includes long ot and  offer more than your counterpart be it a male or female i would want a firewoman to have a salary someone that could carry me and bring me yo safety if your smart enough to rake more profit to the company then its just common sense i wonder how many women would want to work in a sewer,NOT
and this is why we cant allow gender is a choice to succeed,ABU
all these videos exposing the wage gap all seem to be missing the most important factor which is truth that even if after recalculating the gap we came up to  then there is no need to further justify that this  has reasons why can we not be rational and accept that this  or even  out of it is due to discrimination which we all know exist on some level and also we all need to accept the fact that this type of discrimination is not the bad kind as men are naturally better at ceo and managing positions then women which is even reflected by the fact that over  of female business owners employ a male to run it for them so overall it doesnt matter how big the gap actually is because it can all be boiled down to who is naturally better and not because of gender discrimination,ABU
those are not girls all feelings aside,NOT
these girls didnt even know that these two were transgender which makes this completely unfair for the girls and their families they should have been given a heads up at least so they could express their feelings on the matter girls can be as strong and as fast as boys if they put their hearts and minds to it being from texas its just something girls are taught from an early age at least my generation and the ones before mine were girls play football with the boys here so different genders playing sports together is not a huge deal here its just the ignorance of not informing the other players and their families,NOT
ive never been so confused in my life,NOT
i enjoyed this new perspective,NOT
she is my hero,NOT
trisha eats meat  hate comments trisha goes vegan  hate comments ,NOT

hope that every sexist or feminists can finally use their brains or common sense after watching this,NOT
i just watched the from farm to fridge video and im so disturbed and upset by it i made the decision to cut pork out of my diet when i was only  years old because of my love for pigs and my realisation at the mistreatment of them at most slaughterhouses in the uk i have still continued to eat other meats and dairy products but after seeing that i am seriously considering cutting all of that out of my diet freelee i think you spreading awareness like this is awesome and inspiring and im so glad that you come on here and present people with the harsh truth of the unethical treatment of these animals ive always been wary of your videos thinking you were too harsh or mean and uncalled for but now i realise you really just do it to impact people and make them realise that this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed keep doing what youre doing xxx,NOT
all students should be shown this in schools especially in colleges,NOT
this isnt sexism its common sense ground shakes as feminists march towards us with antimisogynist posters,NOT

when i want quick vegan junkfast food i order the  layer burrito from taco bell ask for no cheese and no sour cream and cinnamon twists sooooooo good,NOT
your garbage against real men so you gotta race someone you have a advantage against,ABU
the problem is that people just look at that one statistic and have different thoughts the wage warriors will look at the  statistic and think thats unequal therefore there is a problem men earn more must be misogyny i look at that statistic and think interesting i wonder why that happens there can be innocent reasons for things occurring,NOT
yup unfair advantage testosterone and thousands of years be faster stronger than women,NOT
prager u has an informative upload on this topic called there is no gender wage gap agree or disagree it poses some interesting facts,NOT
well not to sound like a d moron like hunter avallone but i hate to break it to you the wage gap was debunk numerous of times and it has been a mess for a very very long time however talk about women that are suffering from real depression i can the middle east or an africa on other places in the world ,NOT
hey congratz vox you actually placed some honest info to the public even through you still cant figure earningwage but you at least realized that women become mothers the most important job in the world now you just need to realize that a mans entry level job earning is higher because men make over  of the worker base for the most dangerous and physically demanding jobs on the market oil rigs sanitationetc baby steps thats all i can say,ABU
i was waiting for this,NOT
im so proud of her,NOT
btw make sure youre still getting enough dietary fat a lot of raw vegans like the  ones dont because you dont want to get secondary amenorrhoea losing your menstrual cycle,NOT
i dont consider myself a vegan im a raw plant based eater i dont eat no vegan processed foods with toxic chemicals in the ingredients or i dont eat out at vegan restaurants i make everything from scratch good video though,NOT
as i am bi and have had crushes on all most every category i most be some freaky chimera then huh,NOT
atttention also is it just me or does she look like a damned corpse she resurrects just to look for her next attention meal,ABU
did they consider benefits in with earnings too,NOT
my favourite thing about this video is how trish was calling freelee beautiful and complimenting her out of all the controversial videos freelee has made the worst meanest ones have been about trish and yet trish will still say such kind things about her,NOT
excellent finally the truth,NOT
god bless you,NOT
hey freelee do you have any tips for students still living together with their parentsbecause its just really difficult to go vegan when your parents are not even fully accepting that youre a vegetarian thanks maybe youre reading this i would be soooooooo happy about a video thats adressing problems like this,NOT
trevor noah either the world ends or we all become vegan   of the world after living with you militant vegans and environmentalists the end doesnt seem so bad,NOT
bruh i dont even know what to say its just really annoying,NOT
why are they still pushing this agenda the pay gap has been debunked time and time again yet there is a trending topic about it on google and youtube,NOT
the solution shouldnt be get jobs with more flexible hours it should be redistributing the household chores equally between men and women,NOT
ok ladies start start choosing better jobs,NOT
can u slow your talk the fuck down ilysm gurl,NOT
wow i actually learned a lot from this i didnt know what to believe with this topic so thank you,NOT
why do you say female pharmacists make  of what male pharmacists make thats not true they make  of what their male counterparts make for the same amount of hours if women work less then they get paid less thats the issue,NOT
look she isnt trans obviously but its kind of funny how exclusive and special some trans people think they are you are not better than someone else if you have transitioned fully to the opposite gender and actually accept the gender binary umm what about nonbinary genderfluid queer i just love how so many people in various minority groups such as lgbt like to and have literally no problem with telling other people how wrong they are but then insisting that other people accept them for who they identify as eg trans its just baffling even if you dont agree or understand how can you justify that when that is literally your life or has been in the past people judging you and not accepting you its just preposterous its like people with disabilities judging and not accepting other people with disabilities solely or in large part due to their disabilities like a deaf or blind person claiming they dont see it as a disability and insisting you accept them as they are and then judging not accepting and being ableist towards someone with down syndrome or who uses a wheelchair or something like wtf,NOT
based mom strikes again,NOT
bitch ill shoot you,ABU
finally no more leftard bullshit good work,NOT
noone privileged cis white women hm i am going to pretend to be trans,NOT
the left wants to use biology to argue male privilege when it comes to abuse and rape but not herewhat gives just because you say or feel you are something does not mean you are,NOT
she also forgot different educations what school they went to grades from that school along with which degree and that there are more men in specific higher paying fields stem fields to be more specific so the  cents yo the dollar become  cents to the dollar and there are more variables that can be taken into account that just arent one being kids income and how many women who dont work and how many men dont work which can put it in the range of being  cents to the exact same payment in all honesty if there is a sexism variable in here its minute and insignificant because there is a law against it,NOT
i agree with this but is it common sense that someone who works a reasonable expected amount of hours recieves less pay and chance of promotion than someone who works any shifts asked i know theyre being paid for extra work but some people want a stable life work balance maybe they have a family why should they be punished for doing the regular expected shift just interested in peoples opinions i dont know the answer myself so dont rant at me,NOT
its just selfish honestly they think only of themselves and what makes them feel happy or safe not even stopping for a second to think of the scholarships awards and opportunities that they are taking away from other people the whole situation is just disgusting,NOT
hey girl even if you cant stay vegan every step counts going meatless or limiting dairy are great steps too,NOT
most people who have a brain can work this out by themselves but because femenist are dillusional its pointlessly explaining it they may aswell think the earths flat,ABU
in malaysia we dont have gender wage gap since ,NOT
veggies veggies veggies girl when im vegan i think of myself as a vegetarian with limitations eat loads of cooked veggies you can do soooo much with veggies broccoli steamed chopped in dishes green beans garlic and olive oil or coconut oil cauliflower spaghetti squash as pasta garbanzo beans are great they are good in a stew w vegatable stock or water beans tomato loads of fresh herbs chili powder garlic onion zucchini carrots etc i find that when you chose a healthy lifestyle like this it forces you to cook all your meals its much easier that way fruits are cool too but its really important to eat a veggie or two w each meal,NOT
is trisha paytas the offspring off daisy and donald duck,ABU
oven baked veggies like aubergine carrot potato onion bellpepper etc with a dip cashew cheese vegan sour cream vegan mayo homemade ketchup is really nice also soups and stews with rice oven baked potato wedges with tomato sauce and apple salsa is amazing also all kinds of beans instead of meat in tacos or burritos oven baked falafel with salad and hummus there are so much things out there for vegans to eat you just have to find it with a little bit of trial and error becoming vegan is hard if you dont know where to look but most of your favorite foods can be made vegan it just takes a little bit of effort but once you get past the first week  and drop the you cant eat anything  attitude it is easy and effortless  good luck trish,NOT
im straight so i dont rly have a say in this but what the fuck,NOT
call it earnings gap not wage gap if you want to be accurate,NOT
i love when people debunk the wage gap but i love it even more when its a woman who does it,NOT

vox doesnt understand the difference between wages and earnings,NOT
yes so happy shes vegan,NOT
positive video i love it ,NOT
feminists will never give up the  cent myth they realize that it is their greatest weapon feminists argue that women are underrepresented in upperclass fields but it certainly isnt due to discrimination  of all colleges have affirmative action policies that favor women and discriminate against men,ABU
its gonna piss feminists off that a woman made this video,NOT
sooo if you use labels trish is gender fluid,NOT
your deviated septum is really distracting,NOT
this s just wonderful  im so glad these girls can run and compete as women to make them run with those nasty boys would be so wrong go girl go it doesnt matter if they win or not winnings not everything just give the other girls an award for competing,NOT
milli vanilli still up to their old tricks,NOT
all dislikes are feminists in denial,NOT
trisha isnt vegan,NOT
every one needs to see this,NOT
good god trish ,NOT
so if i understand correctly because you dont wear a lot of makeup in real life and youre not overly feminine youre a guy  you are not a male because you do not identify with femininityfemale gender roles female societal expectations and saying otherwise is crazy harmful gender  sex honestly the more i think about it the more im realising radical feminists have the right idea when it comes to understanding sexgender if you identify with a gender thats different to your own so in this case masculinity instead of femininity you should work to dismantle gender norms to make it so a female can do traditionally masculine things likenot wearing makeup without it being weird your sex and identity arent the problem and you shouldnt work on changing either so it matches whatever gender roles you want to follow again the implications of doing this are crazy i dont understand why a right winger saying females makeup is sexist but somehow wrapping the same talking point in leftist mumbo jumbo is all of a sudden progressiveor take use another example you gave i feel male because im assertive progressive im not even mad at you trish we live in a society thats so binary that its very normal to feel the way you feel but i hope you realise soon that you are not a male just because you dont  percent behave the way you are expected to as a female youre just normal noone identifies with their gendergender roles  percent editive just finished the vid and i think the issue here is that the female form is very sexualised by the male gaze and i think in many ways presenting as a male  short hair binding wearing baggy clohes is a way for you to evade that very sexualised perception of your self by men the freedom you feel by presenting as a man makes sense as youve said males are free from the expectation to wear makeup we dont have to do our hair we dont get looked at it or hit on by weird sleazy dudes sending you lots of love it probably isnt at all to feel what youre feeling and i hope all the people attacking you take a step back and realise how normal it is for you to feel the way you feel as a woman in society like oursthe male gaze is toxic af,NOT
yes ve gan,NOT
just gained all new respect for trish after seeing freelee make a video that you made one saying youre going vegan im re subscribing ,NOT
in my country women are paid way more than men in basic salary add other benefits like extra allowances less working hours better work life balance etc etc and women are paid more than double of what men are paid with the same qualifications and skills ,NOT
u cant just go vegan u have to go into it not just eat fruit,NOT
this video is terrible it tells the truththe truth is not politically correct,NOT
so all the girls have to pay the price because we have to allow two participate that want to be females sorry thats not a daughter you had a boy,ABU
these boys need to be kicked off the team immediately how dare they,ABU
she just uploaded a mukbang though lmao i love trisha though shes hilarious with these ups and downs with diets,NOT
thank you christina hoff summer you are my hero,NOT
i dont understand why people want mothers to work and fathers to care for children there is a reason that these socalled gender roles have developed and it is the simple fact that men and women differ biologically women on average do a much better job with child rearing than men on the other hand men on average are willing to sacrifice almost everything for their families financial stability ive seen women throw it all away to be mothers and ive seen men throw themselves into work to support their families at the cost of rarely being with them the happiest families are those who find a happy medium but the woman should be the caregiver and the man the breadwinner thats just how it works,NOT
so heres what im thinking atm i dont think shes transgender at all but i do think this is coming from a place of her not having a total grasp on who she truly is not that i can say that i do either theres something psychologically not right with her i believe i think her career and poor decisionsdrug use has probably made it worse or shes trolling but im kind of starting to think her issues run deeper than previous thought,NOT
i dont think its right its like having a black history month award and giving it to  cash me outside  girl or a rachel dozel just because you think in your head youre a person of color doesnt make it real your dna will not change simple its not fair to those girls,NOT
we also miss why there is sbout  reasons,NOT
they should compete against other heshes,ABU
the us have become very very sick,ABU
at my job most of the females leave work an hour early a few days out of the week there is only  guy that likes to leave early he hates the job those same women complain they dont make as much as the guys  we stay behind sometimes we are all paid the exact same,NOT
thank you for this she needs some mental help,NOT
they can call it what they want but i call it a dirty rotten unfair advantage,ABU
shes just trying it out i dont think shes officially going vegan for good dont get too excited,NOT
ugh i can never go vegan,NOT

thank you pbn once again for this documentary i have been watching these for years and always look forward to the next one ,NOT
cant wait to see all the good news coming in  veganlove,NOT
me when my muscles are glistening in the wind,NOT
marginalizing or creating another league is not even that is not the right way they are doing hormone therapy so i am confused why this is a problem that they are running,NOT
some media really make you out to be a crazy right winger but you seem really dont to earth cant do anything other than agree with this video  dont agree with all your videos though ,NOT
it makes me cry to it hurts so much so see an animal so harmless get abused and especially when u have animals u love very much imagine people doing that to ur own animals i have  birds so it definitely is hard seeing chickens get thrown around like their nothing i live in hills so i see cows with there babies happy and living their life and it hurts to see them get hurt like that some humans just dont have a heart to care for things we should be thankful we have we dont deserve to have animals on this earth if we r going to treat them like shit,NOT
the issue is wage transparency in work places obfuscating pay impacts all groups this is because inevitably differences would be driven by the negotiation phase of hiring which ever group is better at this will be able to edge ahead for doing the exact same thing this is why all your business dots perform the worse,NOT
those are men kicking girls ass in track lol,ABU
you were one of the people who encouraged me to go vegan and i feel so good inside and out,NOT
i tried to be vegan and i almost killed everyone meat eater forever ,NOT
but u yourself have pointed out transgender ppl dont transition and transexual people do and thats the difference lol whatever gita your narrative i guess,NOT
you might gain a little weight at the begging because your body is getting used to a fab change  but after if you eat whole foods  you will drop all that unnecessary fat ,NOT
vox loves to put out liberal propaganda the market is efficiently regulating wages as necessary further even if it wasnt that implies a great opportunity to fix it via the freemarket as an employer would take advantage of lower waged women who as suggested produce equal output government intervention is not necessary in addition to this im extremely skeptical of anything a liberal says after all at first it was just the  per dollar claim liberalism is a pack of lies starting with the misuse of the term liberal,NOT
baby carrots and hummus is sooooo good,NOT
not bravery its blasphemous,NOT
trisha says something controversial or trolls and then starts tweeting about her only fans and adult content this is nothing more than a marketing scheme really,NOT
veggie for  years just gotta do the dairy to be vegan,NOT
ok so to start a vegan diet drink alot of water fruits and veggies i personally love sauted mushroompeppers and onions with whole wheat pasta legit soooo yummy  filling just drown it in tomato sauce its not as hard as you might think keep up the positive energy good luck sweetface ,NOT
her voice is so soft and sweet ,NOT
go on pinterest they have tons of boards and shopping lists for people just starting out on vegan also soooo happy that you are trying,NOT
gender wage gap is they basically woman more money for doing less,NOT
the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum  even encourage the more critical and dissident views that gives people the sense that theres free thinking going on while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate noam chomsky,NOT
ooh this is gonna trigger so many feminists,NOT
there was one video where you said youd do a tribute to a positiveempowering trans person at the end of your trans videos why dont you do that anymore,NOT
the bible app is free,NOT
the only reason feminists talk about the wage gap is because they just want higher pay,NOT
i thank god that woman like her exist ,NOT

same situation as wrestling simply not fair at all,ABU
brilliant and enlightening video i was only hoping you wouldve talked a little about the women working fulltime that decide to have a baby and raise a family i was curious to see the possible relations between this and the wage gap,NOT
you just got a new subscriber ,NOT
way to go trisha much love u r amazing for making this decision ,NOT
i subscribed after the nd video i watched just to make sure it wasnt a one time deal in the late s i found myself with many gay friends and i would have considered myself a strong proponent for the gay community and for transgender people i served in the military for  years and i have met many gay sailors this was before dont ask dont tell i didnt agree with a lot of the rules etc i really dont think that a persons sexual preference is anyones business and the gays that i knew  everyone knew and no one cared they were professional and were every bit a sailor some better than i was  a hetero fem one of my best friends was drag at night like i said no one cared in the s i used to get really pissed off at women in bars who would dance and make out with each other in bars to pick up men of course this was my opinion but lesbian and gays have fought the good fight for equality and here are women playing lesbian just for a one nighter i never asked a lesbian how they felt about that but for me i felt like it was a slap in the face of lesbians who have been locked in the closet but now its cool to act lesbian to me it was making a mockery of the being lesbian like playing lesbian as a convenience to get what you want is ok to me it wasnt i may not be entitled to an opinion as i have not lived as lesbian or trans skip to the bathroom situation i am not sure about how schools handle it so i cant comment i fully supported same sex union i felt it was bad judgement for the lgbtq community to force the world marriage on mainstream i more than likely did not fully understand why they needed to use the term marriage in my opinion had the lgbtq community asked for something that should be legal for everyone to engage in a civil union for legal reasons like insurance custody etc thing would be better for the lgbtq community today then the focus on transgenders and public bathrooms i think this whole mess really put the transgenders back to square one now society has the opinion that transgender  some of the crazies ive seen in your videos like i told my friends back when obama was threatening roy cooper and the crap that went down in north carolina transgenders have been around for many many years and they have been using the wrong bathrooms and no one knew i honestly dont thank any truly trans woman has a beard or any facial hair from what i know about a trans male to female that facial hair would feel like acid on there face it just wouldnt be there miss white i had no clue you were trans just another beautiful girl i know there are some trans folks who have not had access to some of the medical treatments you may have had access to but if there are males transitioning to female there are many no medical things a person can do to alter your appearance i used to have a very short hair cut and im not for everyday very feminine so i have been mistaken as lesbian a few times i know this is a rant but i guess im writing because maybe someone will read this and understand that most main stream people dont hold hatred against lesbian gays and transgenders but the problem is that this has become twisted and perverted and this has became forced on the country and from experience i dont and i dont think anyone else wants to be forced to accept some of the things the lgbtq community is pushing anyway love your show and i wish you all the best and i appreciate that you have your show to educate folks like me and folks not like me,NOT
maddox sure does look different these days,NOT
yayfrelee the bananna girl will be so happy,NOT
im transgender and this is super offensive,NOT
react to her stupid did scandal she just manages to offend at least one community every damn year,NOT
im so happy trisha has taken the step to veganism ,NOT
mcdonalds advert came on before this,NOT
the factual feminist here on youtube did an entire series on why this wage gap is basically just a statistical variance in how people choose what to do with their lives women are not at all interested in dangerous dirty disgusting professions like sewage and mining and construction these do not appeal to women at all they would rather have a fun safe lowpaying job than a miserable dangerous highpaying job men are the sacrificial laborers of our society and we pay them significantly more than women because of that that is also why women take on the dominant role in the household because the man is more likely to die and it mitigates the damage to the home if he does these could be socially constructed things or just pure evolutionary necessity either way the wage gap doesnt tell any of the story its just a statistic that keeps getting repeated over and over again with no context,NOT
pathetic hot mess attention seeking get help,NOT
why dont businesses hire only women because the majority of women takes maternity leave so businesses wouldnt have any employees isnt that obvious,NOT
 feminists refuse to believe the truth,NOT
this was done really well didnt blame it on gender but the fact that women generally take care of the kids at home really well done,NOT
such a fucking stupid world we live in,NOT
hey trish its the trans community picking up the phone were disconnecting the line bitch,ABU
yes d im so freaking happy,NOT
good luck actually i have been thinking your looking really good already between that and dancing you will be in shape in no time,NOT
why are we even talking about this your men racing against woman wtf race against men fucking idiots,ABU
feminist will only listen to females but when men tells them theyre wrong it somehow turns into sexual abuse ,NOT
obviously its unfair testosterone,NOT
freelee she just posted a snap of her eating chicken and waffles,NOT
who else is looking for feminists in the comments,NOT
using sweetie in a sentence is pretty womanly,NOT
and apparently in the s when women did have lower pay than men women eventually took over those jobs,NOT
at first i was really annoyed and she didnt make sense but when she talked about when she did her hair like a boy she felt free and happy i honestly im happy for you do you boo,NOT
reason for wage gap is also that men have on average a higher iq than women you can see this by looking at chesssnooker ratings all of the top players are men,NOT
wage gap is a myth if men and women have the same job title the same duties or work load and work the same hour how could they get payed less it would be discrimination which is a very straight forward lawsuit which no employer would gamble  if the pay gap was so distant why are they paying men more when they could save millions of dollars a year in big corporations and thousands in smaller business ,NOT
k dislikes i see how many feminists have watched this video,NOT
just because you think you have big dick energy doesnt automatically make you trans basically,NOT
this video must be from a while ago,NOT
this is what milo yiannopoulos ben shapiro and the alt right have been trying to say for like the last  years,NOT
i didnt think it was possible for box to make a video that was educational in politics,NOT
the heartbreak tour must have been a flop,NOT
bahahahahahahahahha oh man if you told me this kind of shit would be happening in   years ago id laugh im still laughing the parents are wondering if they have an unfair advantage looooool,ABU
this video provoked me so much the wege gap is  about sexism womendominated professions are lower paid than maledominating professions even in a scenario where both jobs requires a university degree and the same dedication and hours spent at work the thing about that men are willing to work more hours relocate etc depends only by the fact that they are not expected by society to take equal responsibility for children and household work women for example have far more parental days and are expected to stay at home when the child is sick for example  of course this will ultimately bring the woman less money this is not a choice it is a patriarchal structure,NOT
with me being trans myself i think that they should be able to play sports on the team or sport that they identify with especially if they have completed  year of hormone therapy and also if they have had surgery surgery you remove the natural hormone you where born with and replace it with the hormone of your gender,NOT
raw vegan desserts all i have to sayyy ah they are so good look up no bake peanut butter mocha cake it is truly amazing,NOT
all you meat eating cunts go watch farm to fridge,NOT
trish try eating waffles with earth balance then also use earth balance for toast  put garlic on it and you can make quick  easy garlic bread  ,NOT
didnt she at one point in one of her vids say she has a makeup artist and hairstylist make her up every morning,NOT
dad had a lispand a pinkish shirt wonder where the boy got his confussion from,ABU
so because i work  hours and my sister works  hours im an evil person because i make more,NOT
this and the fact that we as a species subconsciously discriminate based on a lot of factors is why we think there is a huge inequality an employer will pick a tall guy over a short one a skinny girl over a fat one a man over a woman etc it doesnt necessarily mean inequality,NOT
yes blair i was disgusted she kept using all these classic sexist tropes to say therefore she is a male like what,NOT
im sure its been said in the comments already but this is an earnings gap not a wage gap theres a world of difference between the two,NOT
also you have to look at the total reality who has to buy the house car who pays for the dates and vacations who pays for all the bullshit the woman and the kids want who pays for child support and alimony while the female just gets on welfare and gets free handouts that will further justify the wages gap,NOT
this is silly what ever there mind says they are their body is male its not fair until they can find other transgender girls to race they have an unfair advantage,ABU
im a lesbian and im attracted to straight girls doesnt mean im a straight man,NOT
she just released nude photos of herself i high doubt she has dysphoria,NOT
what is that ,NOT
lol the feminists and the transgender wack jobs are finally going to turn on themselves i mean were all equal until men have a psychological disorder and compete with and bury women but thats not fair ,ABU
everything cool until the explanation of why gap is bigger for business job seems a little made up in my opinion,NOT
lol when will all of you moron fishies realize how hard she trolls you guys,NOT
im a bit pessimistic about people for me the main reason was enough to quit meat but for the majority  more still arent,NOT
this video is all over the place,NOT
i always understood these real factors,NOT
love this video,NOT
i identify as male wears acrylic nails wears makeup grows out hair super long and complains about her boobs honey if you want to get it fixed you have the money and your not trans your just most likely a tomboy and i am transgender,NOT
she may be crazy but no such thing as bad publicity i think you paid for her new purse,NOT
ive read the comments on her video the video she recorded is like a month old shes already eating animals again ,NOT
wait why were the woman paid less than men in their jobs after college,NOT
hey you people wanna see something funny go to indeedcom and look at the salaries for people working in buzzfeed men get paid less than women and more women work there and buzzfeed has a very small white amount of people working there talk about equality huh,NOT
trish when you said that you started to care about animals suffering thats the moment i knew you would succeed if you go on a vegan diet for superficial reasons just to look better trust me it is so mentally destructive you end up feeling like binging just to rebel against a very restrictive regime but if you connect with the animal suffering then eating animal products will not even cross your mind it will not feel like a diet anymore every meal will be you taking a stand against abuse and contributing to a better world it will give your life so much meaning and purpose and bring you so much happiness i promise,NOT
her eyes look a billion times regular size instead of a illigal alien shes a legal alien haha ps shes right and said smart things a good question comes iup from this study why do women work less and are inflexible they have children or dont want to work at night caus its scary,NOT
if you want a spicy snack thats vegan try takis they are my favorite i looked it up and there vegan,NOT
it is because of what they did they are being allowed to steal from young girls because they want to be happy and she said playing devils advocate and asked them to look at it from the girls side so  the devil is the girls here fuck this this is bs you are a bunch of self entitled pricks ,ABU
if youre interested in really becoming vegan contact me or any vegan will be happy to help you  im really happy to hear that youre going vegan  i truly hope that it will last since you know so many vegan people especially freelee  i would be really disappointed if you failed at the vegan lifestyle because it is awesome for you ,NOT
i know you like freelees body trish but personally i rly rly rly like ur body now like live your life girl but to me you look good already,NOT
feminist double thinking propaganda,NOT
so excited for you i recently went vegan too so if you have any questions about what the first few weeks are like id be happy to help your skin is going to look amazing,NOT
freelee you are the person who helped me go vegan a so many others no matter the out come of thisthank you for all your efforts you will continue to help others go vegangood luck to her,NOT
then she makes more watch me eat food videosmost likely not vegan,NOT
i cant find the wwau  cents anywhere cant come one direct me to it edit nvm found out that they took it down guess it didnt support their opinions,NOT
i literally watched the two seconds that you showed of those slaughterhouse videos and have decided to go vegan animals dont deserve that bullshit,NOT
if the wage gap were real same jobs and responsibilities wouldnt companies would hire an all female staff and save thousands of dollars,NOT
a transgender woman is not brave because he puts himself out there and competes against other girls what would make them brave is running against men as a transgender  even beating them,NOT
is this a joke or can someone tell me if this is a joke,ABU
i think vox finally got something right,NOT
ah my daily dose of logic and reasoning for the day  ,NOT
another one of those talentless people who thinks reacting to videos thinking its a talent and different,NOT
who is responsible for this,NOT
you can eat however many fruits and veggies you want on a vegan diet not meat substitutes though or bready carbey things also stay away from soy it makes you break out like crazy because it raises estrogen levels in your body its all hugely processed too good luck rooting for you xo,NOT
good on the girls who came forward to stop this look at the actual girls participating they are losing out on opportunities that can put them in possible better schools down the track if you choose to identify as a women then you cant represent the school too much room for cheating,NOT
you never mentioned the fact that men work more hours than women do for the same level of job in the same sector that also contributes,NOT
 apparently i have multiple personalities cos im genderfluid,NOT
so moral of the story if your in business dont have kids,NOT
im so proud of you trish and if you want a good vegan junk food  search up lenny and larry cookies they are sooooo amazing,NOT
vitamin b k a dha unless you have a fermentative stomach and gut you are not getting enough of those by eating plants veganism is an eating disorder,ABU
lots and lots of further success for  still there is so much to be done so much change to be made,NOT
so we need to change the world to fit the ideals of women as opposed to leaving women to change to fit the ideals of the world that sounds efficient business owners will love this,NOT
they are boysperiod they can compete against boys or not at all if they want to compete against other trans athletes they should make their own league,ABU
omg trish you are so beautiful ilysm good job for taking charge and trying to lose weight the healthy way,NOT
as a male nurse i can attest that nursing is mostly made of women more than  but nurse anesthesia is almost  this is tru for icu nursing where nurses are paid more and night shift work travel work etc there is no way in hell women in nursing are making less for the same job,NOT
vox is such a joke there is no wage gap,NOT
i just hate how people like trisha just mocks the actual trans community,NOT
i would reccomend you to not only eat fruits ang veggies eat pasta rice potatos etc too also if you do eat any animal products by accident dont beat yourself up or give up its so important because if you beat yourself up about it you are likely to just give up and also eat when youre hungy your body is telling you that you need food so give your body food i love you so much trisha and i love that you are doing this hope it sticks with you best of luck,NOT
im so happy veganism is finally catching on in the mainstream,NOT
ok sure mabye the wage gap has more to do with personal choice but if we look at the  highest paying majors in elite schools  of them have a leading male public and when u see the  least paying majors  have a female public the statement this research makes is that biology makes women more into emotional stuff like social work and psicology while men are more interested in mechanical work so when we look at this in terms of career choices of course men pick the higher paying career paths not necessarily because of the money but its what they like and what theyre good at and what is really being siad here is that the reason why mechanical work is higher paying than social work is because we value mens work a lot more than we do womens,NOT
 notice how the gap increases steadily in prime pregnancy yearshmmmmmm i wonder if there could be a correlation,NOT
what about the wage gap between attack helicopters and men,NOT
please dont eat a ridiculous amount of fruit calories from fruit arent magic if you eat too much fruit you will gain weight people on the rt diet have gained weight look up unnatural vegans video called weight gain on bad fullyraw diet before  after photos,NOT
somebody put me on the same prescription as her she makes no sense,NOT
how does the wind affect muscles do i not understand physics or fitness im very lost,NOT
here in germany at my university there was a whole day dedicated to the gender wage gap and all those mindless drones spewed out the same nonsense and when you tried to debate them they kept yapping circular arguments ,NOT
this video says that women choose to earn less than men therefore we need to change our jobs to be more inconvenient just so they suit women better ye totally,NOT
i eat fruit smoothies every morning for breakfast i eat mostly rice and tortillas with avacado and stuff like that ,NOT

spelling error where subtitles in english spanish and chinease,NOT
hormone therapy cant change male anatomy and build,NOT
kids ruin everything but thanks for getting into the nuance of the issue,NOT
so the gender wage gap has nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with personal choices it cracked me up that at the end she suggested we need to change jobs that reward working long hours because women dont tend to choose to work long hours what we really need to do is accept that its ok for men to earn more as long as its simply a result of their decision to be more dedicated to their work,NOT
did you make this video to test the conservative point of view ive been in the work force for  years and yes theres a gender wage gap to use an argument such as men are willing to be on call at all times etc is why theyre paid more is not valid women who work the same long hours and are available at all hours get paid less period companies wouldnt hire just women to save the  because they still believe men can do a better job even if it costs more,NOT
i havent been able to eat chicken in  months myselfi,NOT
pay rate is the same for men and women  if you ladies want to earn the same as men doing the same job stop complaining get off your arse and work the same amount of hours,ABU
transgenders should compete among themselvesi would like to see a woman who transit as a male compete with males,ABU
dont be worried about eating too much since youre cutting so much out youll be fine,NOT
its fact liberals and feminist are fake masked people and mislead others,NOT
i am male i like girls but i want to be a girl too,NOT
you ate chicken nuggets on your snapchat yesterday,NOT
yes trish im so proud of you,NOT
lmao the gap doesnt exist its just a median between men and women women choose less paying jobs thus resulting in this wage gap,NOT
this is so great  so happy to see you do this ,NOT
men work harder,NOT
transgenders make me cringe,NOT
when the problem is individual choice then there is no problem,NOT
the milk song was funny the carnivores were too people will eventually learn the truth or have diseaseits their choice im excited for my own journey its been amazing so far being vegan im so thankful for the information keep inspiring others with your actions and the truth,NOT
men are tired of being talked down to by women just claim to be transgender and now you can just beat the hell out of them its just another cat fight right nothing will happen,NOT
trisha  having a zit doesnt all the sudden make you a guy lmao,NOT

i really thought she was born male i think there has been lip injections and the hair isnt nice that vocal fry croaky voice is horrible,NOT
whats your problem with feminists we just want justice  loved the video tho,NOT
i love you trish i dont care what you eat,NOT
theres only a wage gap because of womens individual choices its nothing to do with businesses underpaying stop being privileged and trying to demand money you havent earned,NOT
do i think im transgender  do i identify with my born pronouns  hunny you cant be both  you can use they them pronouns and be non binary but you cant be hehimhissheher hers its not how it works ,NOT
the wage gap doesnt exist,ABU
if people did they homework about hormones everything changes so they wont be as active since the estrogen is higher yes testosterone is there but very much deductible especially after surgery,NOT
women take on more house hold tasks in couples because they have a diffrent standard they want to uphold men are not waiting around for people to fix their problems they just simply dont view them as problems,NOT
like like like i think shes transgrammar ,NOT
they couldnt win the boys track competition so they have to join the girl to have a muscular advantage naw we have no advantages as boys all of human science are lies,ABU
confusing much sheesh help me blair my dog wants to transition to be a cat what should i do,NOT

theres literally nothing confusing about the pronoun theythem when youre talking about someone that you dont know you use the word they if your female friend said that she got robbed you would say  what did they look like this is one singular person where is the confusion,NOT
finally vox welcome to logic,NOT
wow so proud of you even if its only for  weeks rooting for you ,NOT
oh honey we are all attracted to gay men bc they take care of themselves dress well and go to the gym that doesnt make you anything trans people have power when people are begging to be part of the club,NOT
the problem is that sexism keeps women out of the higher paying fields and positions and thus pushes them towards the lower paying majors,NOT
sorry your either a girl or boy straight or gay thsts its whats this transgender craziness,ABU
i think what were witnessing is a person slowly slipping into insanity,ABU
just because a wage gap isnt necessarily  the cause of employers intentionally saying to themselves i think ill pay x group less doesnt mean that wage gap is automatically innocent or rather that only the portion which we can directly connect to an explicit intent to discriminate as the cause of the gap is problematic andor unfair andor discriminatory as the narrator herself points outthere are many possible explanations including factors influencing these choices men and women make as if choices have ever occurred in a vacuum free of human or natural influences on ones considerations ones socalled free choice it is still entirely possible that the difference in career choices and educational opportunities can be explained less by womens willingness to accept lower compensating fields of work but instead the tendency of the whole society many of those women included yes to segregate andor selfsegregate women in to particular kinds of work and roles that may or may not be paid or paid as much as roles society at least much of society historically has preferred to push men towards and women away from as much as possiblewith varying degrees of explicitness,NOT
the comment section going to be fun to read,NOT
i give mike mccloskey a great deal of respect for coming out and owning up to the truths exposed in the expose perhaps he can transition his business to a successful and sustainable vegan farm and offer truly educational tours to the public most of us contributed to animal agriculture in one way or another until we were fortunate enough to witness it and have the chance to change our ways i wish him the best financially and spiritually in a new kind and merciful venture,NOT
this information doesnt take into an account how men usually work much more hours than women more hours more money,NOT
i will not be eatinglet me repeat not eating that beyond or impossible meatburgers noway gross that fat dude advertising for the kfc chicken sandwich need to stop playinjust not eat fast food period that is so trueall the bighuge animals do not eat meat cows hippos gorillas giraffes zebras elephants do not eat meatonly eat plantbased foods,NOT
must be a west hollywood thing or maybe im a hag lol ive never experienced straight women crushing on me as a gay guy its an urban gay myth from my perspective,NOT
so i guess we can say that feminists are just lazy at finding a job or at anything,ABU
the freelee is collab shit is wrong since she was talking bout u on a video,NOT
you just need to find a man who has a personality that fits you youre choosing the wrong type of men,NOT
great vegan proteinfiber sources   main things you need to focus your diet around to lose weight or just stay healthy oats  very cheap also and filling every and any kind of nut many breakfast cereals are vegan but i recommend kashi go lean kind for the most protein beans especially black beans are great brown rice tofu  it absorbs any kind of sauce very well and is amazing grilled  peanut butter or peanut butter powder which is lower in fat  calories and tastes great then anything soy  like soy milk and also there are many veggie burgers that are vegan but some contain milk or egg so make sure to check the ingredients first so happy for you trish hope you continue this diet also just wanted to say oreos are vegan in case you want something sweet and ben and jerrys and other brands make vegan ice cream you can purchase also taco bell has some vegan options like i usually get the  layer burrito with no sour cream or cheese its already vegetarian oh and i forgot to mention most whole wheat breads are veganjust remember to check the ingredients,NOT
mental illness spreads,NOT
also if the wage gap shrinks to  cents thats still technically a wage gap,NOT
regarding the lgbt community as a whole not every individual this is all part of the homosexual agenda you can be sure if not curbed it will weaken our entire nation im not at all hesitant to say i dont like them i dont and its their fault for overstepping their boundaries more precisely for their insatiable lust for children i might seem to be offbase until you explore an alternate perspective they have developed an obsession with presumed authority first they presumed to tell straight people that because we dont understand them and because we are uncomfortable with their relentless effort to integrate some form of conveying the hey look at me im gay message into everything they do we are mentally distressed and need counseling then they advanced to corrupting every television program with some form of homosexuality for example i turned on family guy one day the last show i watched regularly and suddenly stewie was gay to me in a modern family the grandparents are babyboomers and parents have tattoos and a mind that is not stuck in a s time warp a boy with  dads and no mom is my idea of a throwedoff family television stations do not have show directors to choose the shows they broadcast they have programming directors who choose the content with which they will program the audience children are a large part of the television audience the entertainment industry has no shortage of homosexuals there are even radio stations and probably television channels that broadcast only content from homosexual performers but if we try something like that they cry because we have violated their right to doublestandards now their lust for children they have demanded the children of the nation which they cannot produce be taught there are more than  genders not only that but they want to tell the other peoples children they can choose their gender leaving a child at home alone is dangerous but it pales in comparison to teaching a child lies in school where they go to learn the truth but lets go on and tell the kids the many genders homosexuals have created in their minds are  as real as the  that can be scientifically proven give the boys female hormones give the girls male steroids theres no reason a  year old girl shouldnt be taught how to put a condom on a lifelike latex penis right thats how the state of california sees it are you starting to see their lust for children yet do your best to convince yourself that will benefit the child as much as the sexually perverted pedophile give them all puberty blocking chemicals to allow them extra time to decide what they are honey if you identify as a toaster thats just fine daddy and daddy will still love you just as much as if you were a pixie or a fairy  i believe in equal rights however when the population of an entire state is forced to accept the fantasies of the mentally ill as reality and abide by laws that mandate promoting the lgbt agenda by teaching children these peoples delusions are reality while ignoring the majority of the population who actually produce the children that is far from equal and  rights what rights who gave them the right to lie to our children oh wait silly me it was obviously their fairy godmother so the result is that a champion female athlete is not only robbed of her status but robbed of her chance to earn a scholarship and maybe a better education than she can get without it because she has to compete against boys who want to dress like girls some girls might rely on a scholarship to go to college there have already been cases where girls in contact sports have been injured by boys dressing up as girls whats next you can be sure the girls are not the only victims though theyre just the first to take a hard blow those boys are in the spotlight now but according to statistics dark times are just a blink away and all for what it is nothing but lust for new meat that motivates the lgb whatever they are this week to recruit children it gets even worse there is a new movement of people seeking to become part of the lgb crowd they have labelled themselves maps are you ready for this minorattracted persons thats the long way to go about saying pedophile they believe it should be legal to  as long as they have the childs permission there was a time it was different but today the propaganda outright lies the selfpromoting content in every form of media and the aggressive recruiting campaign of the homosexual community has saturated every aspect of the nations childrens lives thereby bringing them down to the same disgusting level as pedophiles they dont care if these kids will become so confused and frustrated that theyll rent a gun and buy a bullet before they reach  no i dont dislike them for their sexual preference i despise them for the negative impact the children will feel due to their selfishness lack of respect for the nations youth and for their presumptuous attitude and actions,ABU
alleged  what a sad state of affairs when you have this staring you in the face and nothing is done so these girls  boys get to receive scholarships and other percs id like to see these guys with their homies and see if the charade continues,ABU

gender fluidity exists nonbinary exists tacking yourself to a constructed stereotype of a gay man just because you want to avert the male gaze is not being transgender i support someone feeling less than cis but this is a fucking train wreck that the trans community now has to field trans people have to fight tooth and nail to be taken seriously and now theyre stuck dealing with this,NOT

well the minority lgbtq community who demanded special rights and got them with the support of feminists and left wing lunatics ask them if this is fair they will of course say yes because to do otherwise would show them to be the massive hypocrites they are they dont care about the huge majority against it and the obvious advantages for these girls this is why trump will win again ,NOT
women earn less on average because they work less on average as every alegit statistic shows u guys are supposed to be factual and shouldnt lie about stuff like this to make women look opress when theyre not,ABU

scrolling through the comments looking for freelee,NOT
sorry but the wage gap doesnt exist,NOT
to fix this gap you dont make jobs more flexible timewise thats just stupid what you do is make sure that domestic duties especially involving children are split equally between husband and wife this way women can have kids and still have a career in a job that demands a lot of time also women are treated unfairly in the workplace theyre seen as less effective and evaluated under harder criteria than a man is in order to get promoted to fix this gap we need to make sure women are respected and seen just as capable as a man is and also make sure that domestic work is something everyone should do and is not considered unmanly because a lot of these things are not outright discrimination and mostly on the subconscious level we do not realize it is a problem but it is and it has shown the consequences,NOT
why are transgenders only competing in womens sports i dont see any one of trans women competing against the men hmmmm i wonder why that is,NOT
do vegans hate asians they eat meat therefore theyre evil,ABU

this is a great video good arguments however you didnt take into account other places in the world in easter europe where i live this wage gap is real there is still a lot of people in management places who hire women instead of men for this exact reason they give them less in fact they are going to do the same job but man wouldnt accept this instead a more defenseless woman can be taken advantage of i am willing to believe that in the us and westerneurope its negligible but in the eastern europe and other underdeveloped countries its a real problem,NOT
trisha paytas more like trisha gaytas hahahahahahaha goddem,NOT
what they miss is that its a myth choice is oppress apparently,NOT

oh and in order to lose weight on a vegan diet you can pretty much eat everything you want as long as its a low fat whole food such as fruits vegetables whole grains and beans eating lots of processed foods oils or high fat plant foods like avocado olives coconuts nuts and seeds will likely make you gain weight but in moderation those are fine,NOT

gigi gorgeous is such a stupid airhead i dont regret unsubscribing from her,NOT
i find it interesting how this video could also tie in with the lack of paid maternal and paternal leave women who take time off for a baby do not have to be paid leading to the wage gap yet someone has to bring in money so men are expected to work even if they want to stay with their child its a bad situation all around,NOT
this video didnt acknowledge the large amount of women who do not have kids are are still paid lesser than their male counterparts my seniors who have graduated my law school were paid lesser than the men when offered the associate post maybe its it just about kids,NOT

no mention of the biggest driver of the pay gap motherhood this is a perfect example of a variable labelled as choice that really isnt one the fact that in  the us still proscribes to the breadwinner model is madness and the real reason women earn less than men and it is a sexist model no biological reason why women should be the primary caregivers not supported by any empirical evidence worth reading the lack of affordable childcare access to acceptable maternity leave or good quality parttime work means that mothers are hugely disadvantaged when it comes to work employers are even likely to discriminate against women of childbearing ages simply because they might have kids now you might think hey having kids is a choice that many women benefit emotionally from so why shouldnt they get penalised economically for a personal choice theres two things wrong with that firstly it isnt true for thousands of women who have unplanned pregnancies and secondly having children benefits society especially a capitalist one that needs continuous growth to survive so we should be rewarding mothers not penalising them,NOT

  is not  less than  it is  of  but only  less still a large amount less but not as much as  less,NOT
the fact that women earn  cents for every dollar that a man makes for the same work is bs however lets look at why women make those choices how dod people perceive a woman who decides to dedicate her life to her job instead of finding a husband and having kids how does society view a women who is willing to be on call at all times she is probably a total btch who is going to become an old cat lady with no friends okay so she decides to get married if she works all of the time early in the relationship to try to climb the ladder so she is earning a lot of money people ask why she doesnt spend more time with her husband people ask when she is going to start having children people say things like your biological clock is ticking not to mention if the woman earns more than the man the man is looked down on by society for not providing for his woman on the other hand if the man works long hours and then takes his woman on lavish vacations and buys her nice things people look at how wonderful of a life the couple have now lets say that the woman decides to have children having any job at all people look down on her shouldnt she be home with the children say shes a lawyer and really values her work but the man is willing to be a stay at home dad or do something with shorter more predictable hours on the side now people are flipping their lid because not only is the man not providing for his family like he should but the kids should have their mother at home with them flip roles and suddenly it is just fine the problem isnt that businesses pay  to woman what a man makes but that woman are pressured to sacrifice their career in a way that men arent thats not to say that you dont have to pick and choose what your priorities are or anything if raising a family is more important than working a high paying job then by all means follow your dreams however that is something that a couple should discuss before starting a family and society should stay out of that families business if the mother wants to be a high earning business professional or a lawyer who works  hoursweek while the father works from home as a computer programmer so that he can be with the kids great if the father wants to work the long hours and the mother wants to do something more flexible also great if they both want to work hours that are unpredictable and long well they should think of that before starting a family but both parents should be held responsible not just the mother as soon as society buzzes off thats when the wage gap will disappear,NOT
the next olympics are going to very interesting,NOT
freelee has good smoothies and hot for food is so good,NOT

the best way to transition is by purchasing all fake animal products at the beginning then slowly transitioning into the starch solution,NOT
can someone if in sydney help id like to be vegan and currently trying but i found that vegan products were either super nice and expensive or cheap and tasteless so if anyone can either direct me to probably cheaper stores or take me to vegan places in sydney that would be super helpful inner west preferably east is a tad trekky,NOT
hey trish my advice is eats things that will keep you full so you wont want to eat animal products for example i like to eat oatmeal with fruits and maple sugar or brown sugar and coconut milk its so good anf you can eat a couple ripe bananas too  i promise you wont be hungry until lunch time,NOT
there is a gap there is inequality but the cause is not what anybody thinks the cause is central banks like the fed the sad thing is most people dont have any clue what a central bank is anymore or more important how it really works,NOT

i have been waiting for this love you,NOT
as a lot of this is true but i disagree about one thing the gap while this does depend on the job and the person you arent literally earning  for my  if you were then more people would hire women just like they do illegals,NOT
your salary depend on the job you choose or the one you manage to get not on your gender,NOT
when your bored and home alone,NOT
this made me kinda sad for someone who writes songs about being a bigger size woman its showing that youre not happy with your body you doing this is showing other people that being thick is not ok and having a body like freelee is whats beautiful guess my bodys shit,NOT
the likes on this video speak for itself,NOT
see teacher there is none,NOT
notice how they simply say average earnings and dont take into account that many women by their free will raise families and take off time from work take on average work less hours than men and other factors its funny how feminists of today get so angry about some womens choices but not others i thought they were all for that,NOT
why not compete against the boys and make the point that girls are faster instead of against girls that way theyre using their gender identity to make a real statement guess thats not the pointgets the noggin joggin,NOT

omg trish i hope youre still reading comments you have to look up the starch based diet of dr mcdougall please rawtill wont work for fast weightloss for most people and can lead to weightgain when someones really physically active and fit vegan then its good to add more fruit to maintain weight but for fast weightloss definitely try the wholefood starch based diet with no oil salt or high fat content foods avocadonutsseeds it might also make a huge difference for skin for me it did but also if you have anxiety etc before shooting a music video then find a way to reliefe stress as that could also cause breakouts theres tons of ways to eat vegan it takes a bit time to find the best diet for you just doing alot of research about vegan diets will help preferably the work of plant based doctors like john mcdougall tcolin campbell caldwell esselstyn michael greger remember you dont just want to look healthy but to truly be healthy and minimize your risk for all top killer chronic diseases,NOT
im in a transition  i love the sound of veganism im currently cutting out a ton of animal products  basically i eat like a vegetarian need help here ,NOT

me explaining something to my mom that she questioned about,NOT
oh its only  less then i guess it isnt an issue right who cares as long as it isnt a  difference how can you cite a study showing a genderbased pay gap and then say there is no pay gap how dumb do you think we are this video completely sidesteps the fact that women feel compelled to enter these traditionally female majors just as men gravitate towards traditionally male majors its kind of unfortunate that women were given lowerpaying jobs when they entered the workforce in ww because now the roles have solidified into basically the same roles from  years ago men get higherpaying jobs because they were traditionally the main income earner and women were either single and living on their own or just earning a little extra pay ive gone through the data did you know that women are more likely to switch majors if they earn a low grade in the introductory classes cs get degrees yet for some reason women feel pressure to earn better grades than men on average prageru also forgot that maternity leave is expensive and that its the most commonly cited reason employers have when they are found to have different pay rates for men and women in the same job why would you hire someone who gets a month of paid leave when someone else doesnt when a woman goes on maternity leave a new temp must fill in until she is gone or the firm goes with one less worker for a month either way its an expense they dont have with male employeesthats why people are arguing for paternity leave so this difference is resolved prageru best cherrypickers on youtube who needs truth when you can just ignore everything that proves counterpoint to your beliefs,NOT

this is coming from someone on the left your not the same as females your body produces more muscle mass you get taller you have more testosterone you are not built the same period i think there should be a transgender league how in the hell is someone who competed as a guy and never got within the top  in the races gonna go to female races and easily dominate that should say something,NOT

heres another way to solve this issue let grown adults and employers make free will decisions for themselves and the government stay out of it,NOT
wish i was either gay or blackand i could at least have equality and wouldnt get my a pinched ouch,NOT
this is offensive honestly offensive you can be a dominant masculine female and not be trans you need to be educated on what the fuck dysphoria is before you start to claim you have it in reality you do not you dont know how it feels to be trapped in the wrong body you only know how it feels to be teased for being more masculine and accepting that you are your attraction to gay guys has nothing to do with you being trans thats a fetish you are obviously confused and please go talk to a therapist or maybe kalvin garrah because he knows his shit you need to be educated you do not know your facts or what youre talking about,NOT
this deeply upsets me identifying as a woman does not make you a woman this is unacceptable and anyone who doesnt accept this is just plain ridiculous,ABU

awesome trisha well done so glad to see you going down this path after so much back and forth with freelee over the years the best thing i did when i wen vegan was to look up recipes they dont have to be fancy there are so many out there and it will make it waaaaay easier than trying to figure out on your own what the hell to do with all those veggies youre going down an incredible path and when yo find that love and connection with animals and knowing youre doing right by them by going vegan just fills you with so much positivity and passion best thing i have ever ever done,NOT

trisha is either fishing for attention or shes been so warped by what she sees online she doesnt know whats real and whats not,NOT
what this fails to show is the fact the the other male half of the home is probably working  hours a day  days a week to provide for the family the woman is doing a disproportionate amount of home work well the man is doing a disproportionate amount of dangerous labor and working an aggressive overtime schedule stop blaming society for a problem that doesnt exist,NOT
you can get things like cheating cheese and all that stuff which is basically vegan cheese,NOT
there are so many factors that are not included for example how many woman were followed and how many man more woman means more chance a woman will land a high paying job that raises the average,NOT
never been so confused,NOT

hell yeah if you want to go to amazing vegan restaurants let me know better for the planet health and animals watch conspiracy theres nothing wrong with humans hunting to survive the issue is we dont hunt to survive anymore we actually thrive off plants anyway our teeth jaw formation and intestinal length all prove that we were natural herbivores before we adapted into eating meat to survive cave man days i am so thrilled for you youll feel amazing just eat a lot this lifestyle is in abundance so eat eat and eat also make sure you get your b humans use to acquire b from the soil when we used to eat our produce from the soil but now everything is washed off and cleanedchemically treated so take a b supplement however some people dont believe you need b because our body makes an efficient amount its debatable  percent of all americans have a b deficiency and theres only  percent vegans so this definitely isnt a b issue  enjoy the food,NOT
if companies can get away with paying women less then why dont they fire all men and hire only women up to  of a companys expense are salaries,NOT
going on  months vegan i shouldve done it a long time ago,NOT
the equal pay act of  is federal law prohibiting wage disparity based on gender if you are being paid less than a man for the same job get a lawyer and sue,NOT
these are facts im willing to stand with research has backed the claims given in the video plus a bit of common sense thrown in to boot if the wage gap is  cents why dont employers hire only women,NOT
thank you for clearing this up,NOT

she keeps switching from median salary to average salary which im guessing is to the benefit of her argument,NOT
i always find it weird how someone will try and take an academic approach to a controversial topic and still get hate like what are people so up in arms about the video is literally just citing what studies found,NOT
mukbang please luv u trish  ,NOT
its funny how this video disproves the wage gap,NOT
this is literally why the fake transtrender girls in school would say ye im a boy but some how all be gay and love boys as well they literally just have this mad fascination with gay men gay tv characters gay cos play you name it so they become a fucking gay man to grow the fuck out of it and become normal girls,ABU
bruh literally everything you said as to why you identify as a man i can relate with but youre just being sexist like i dont identify as a man just because i dont like attention and dont wear make up every day its just who i am but im still a female like im not against transgender but like you really dont have any plausible explanation to be and its disrespectful toward people who actually have gender dysphoria and are trans,ABU
so  slow dudes won and placed second in a female track meet,ABU
waits for freelees video,NOT
my mother makes more than my father quite interesting that vox posted somethingsensible,NOT
this is my opinion if you want the wage gap to disappear then work harder for it work for longer take more shifts men on average work harder and longer for more times during the week thats why men gain more money thank you for not freaking out about it like it ruined your life and instead kept your cool,NOT

there is no wage gap but i wish to god there was if so i could just hire women exclusively take out a huge salary while paying them less than i would a man doing the same job and be surrounded by women all day every day charlies angels style,NOT

watch fullyrawkristina if you go vegan,NOT
video title there is no gender wage gap video content there is a gender wage gap but its womens fault iconic,NOT

when ur actually trans watching this losing fucking brain cells,ABU
i miss hi to rick moranis lol,NOT
chances of it ever being  between the two genders is unlikely there always will be a wage gap it might be in favour of men and it may also be in favour of women the wage gap is a good thing as it shows that men and women make different choices based on their gender derived strengths and not because they make up the perfect ratio to appease idiots looking for  gap,NOT
what the hell is wrong with these people black people hold this l,ABU
why do all feminist look alike hmmm,NOT

stupid parent how is this fair boys competing with girls,ABU
vlog your vegan journey,NOT
i thought its possible to be trans and accept the body youre born with,NOT
after seeing some comments regarding the maternity leave i have something to say if you care enough to read things changed so much in the last  years many developed countries have not only maternity leave but paternity leave as well so usually the woman is the first who takes that leave to recover from laboroperation and to breastfeed if they have milk but more and more women choose not to breastfeed or they simply dont have milk childrens health doesnt suffer much from this factor actually then its the dad who takes a leave and women usually leave enough milk at home so that dad could take care of the child there is no reason why he cant if you think about it for example in finland you see as many dads as moms walking in the park with their newborns for that reason so there is no reason for that gap you people are referring to btw statistics tells us that in the past couple of decades more and more dads take a sick leave to take care of a sick child in europe its not only on women anymore spouses are finally a team with equally shared responsibilities after all very few families might afford for one of the parents to stay home to take care of childrenhome because of todays economics so this gap even if it exists should disappear completely in the near future there is no guarantee for a business if they hire a man he isnt the one who will take care of children when they get sick and not to hire a childless woman only because in the future she might have children is not practical at all after all men are physically stronger but womens health and endurance is better and they live longer in almost all of the countries easy statistics to look up they fall sick rarer and take more care of their health and if they are valuable to the business there is no reason not to hire them if they are more suitable to the position and there is absolutely no justified motivation to pay them less even if they take one or two maternity leaves during their career men will take as many months to take care of their health when they fall sick or their children will and it is beautiful if you ask me children have both parents equally present there is no better thing for them i hope these facts are enough for you to realize why there is completely no base at the decision why to pay women less for the same work there is no way for companies to predict the future of the employee no matter the gender,NOT
the comment section is just as idiotic as you would assume,NOT
veganism population control at its finest ,NOT
yeeeessss super excited,NOT
tldr anyone with an issue over this gap is either understand it or is to the extreme far left desiring not equality of opportunity but equality of outcome,NOT
usa is becoming a freak show,NOT

you also cant just invalidate peoples pronouns if someone identifies with theythem pronouns thats not for you to say no thats weird i dont like that,NOT
she needs help and no one can see that she needs comfort,NOT
watermelon is actually not good for you it shouldnt be an active part of your diet its better to use it to replace candy when you want a treat its a lot better for you then chips and candy just not good for meals,NOT
some businesses do only hire women like walmart cashiers,NOT
people keep wanting to put feelings first yes i understand youre a transgender girl and thats your gender identity but you must understand that there is an obvious biological advantage that comes with being biologically born male like the woman said in the video men produce a lot of testosterone which increases the production of red blood cells that absorbs more oxygen enables men to develop larger skeletal muscles and develop larger hearts these give men a larger aerobic advantage so no transgender girls who are biologically men cannot and should not be allowed to compete with cisgender girls because of the obvious unfairness,ABU
i kinda understand why mothers work lesser in their jobs,NOT
i swear i have learned so much from these videos than i did my high school years learning actual real world problems thank you prageru ,NOT
you wouldnt see a trans male competing with biological males because they know theyd be at a disadvantage im not transphobic but they should be looking at facts rather than feelings in a competition ,NOT
science with flexible hours hahahahahahahahahaha nah its just that people whos into bussiness is much more well stupid hahaha they are much more sexist science usually requires much harder schedules than any other field when youre into a proyect aside from that pretty good video,NOT
mayb if u stop bla bla bla and start working harder it wouldnt be the case,NOT
cheating no matter what they are two young men they will always be stronger than a female you are what u were born with idc,ABU
being attracted to gay men is much the same thing as being drawn to married men they arent available so it wont have longevity she subconsciously kills the possibility of having any long term commitment within her relationship shes the definition of self destructive,NOT
people saying it doesnt exist are wrong it is definitely exaggerated though not to mention that all the statistics around this are outdated we should be looking at what women going in to the workforce right now can expect to make compared to their male peers in the same profession the fact that they were using people from different professions is ridiculous there are more women in universities today than men so it stands to reason eventually women will have a higher median income especially considering the lack of women in lower paying labor jobs but noone will say its sexist then,NOT
rice and potatoes veggie chilli and beans,NOT
at  trisha about freelee she looks skinny online  but shes toned and just gorgeous yes,NOT
if the wage gap is so real then why are men even hired if they have to get paid more,NOT
its funny how vox admits that the argument is total bull at the very beginning of the video they admit that the wage gap is based on nothing but median wages of both men and women do you understand what that means that is the average of all female wages compare to all male wages it has nothing to do with females making less money for their time at the same job as a man it only means men spend more time working on average men tend to get pregnant at a far lower rate than women men tend to work more over time than women statistically men are more likely to do high risk jobs that have high pay men are less likely to work minimum wage low skill jobs than women men are more likely to work night shift jobs than women men are more likely to do physical jobs than women men are more likely to pursue lucrative college degrees than women men are more likely to own a business than women men are more likely to do dirty jobs than women men are more likely to stay with the same company for long periods of time than women not for doing the same jobs these are just a few of the examples of why if you compare the totals men make more than women after all if a company could get away with paying women  less than men they would only hire women,NOT
i thought i noticed a bunch of bologna when i heard about this in my economics class,NOT
pasta thats vegan like freelee says carb the fuck up you can get good carbs from potatoes too,NOT
i really wish that they would have covered the blue collared skilled labour jobs thats a whole different story the gap is huge when it comes to pay and advancement between the sexes,NOT
you know i dont really like your channel that much but i agree that trisha is not transgender she needs help because shes sick in the head she is an attention seeker with multiple insecurities,ABU
i wonder were shes getting some of her information because i cant seem to find a link to it anywhere also prager university isnt a university and is heavily bias from the information im finding on it it was founded by a republican radio talk show host dennis prager come on now you guys i would agree that there is a wage gape but both liberal and conservative outlets have already put so much trash statistics that supports only their side that finding the true gap would be hard would it be a big enough difference to argue about thinking logically your never going to make everyone happy so of course people will still argue at the end of the day it falls to an individuals effort to do what you have to so you can be where you want to be,NOT
trisha is just being himself leave him alone i love you trisha ,NOT
im gonna tell my kids this was zach efron,NOT
i was on board with everything you were saying until you started invalidating nonbinary people big yikes,NOT
isnt she the same woman who did that video about dogs and asked if they had brains she may have been trolling in that one too but still,NOT
veganism is a lifestyle a plant based diet is temporary pls dont call yourself a vegan if you dont plan on sticking to the lifestyle,NOT
this is wonderful news im going to go sub on her channel freelee please make a stepbystep howto guide videos for her that we all can follow along so anyone newher fans can also do it together this is what you do best inform others of the cruel food industry inspire others to make an important change in their lives that directly make an impact on stopping the animal cruelty in food industry thank you so much for your voice,NOT
feminism is cancer the wage gap is a myth women if you dont raise our children our society ends and the muslims will force you stay home and be nothing more than baby machines western women you are the most privileged group in history stop indulging your every whim and consider the society that gave you so much again feminism is cancer,ABU
so the wage gap has nothing to do with inequality interesting thx vox,NOT
so the message here is that guys are lazy yeah ill believe that,NOT
beans nuts spinach nearly most green veggies or so ive heard all have protein in them theres always the option of tufo and you can just look up vegan brands that most stores carry,NOT
so i get to be paid as much as a man when im  yaaaaayyyyy progress,NOT
this is almost good enough to be a southpark episode ,NOT
freelee also cycles  miles a week its not all diet,NOT
im sorry not really tho but that was very offensive people dont choose to identify as schizofrenic or mpd people whom put those two diagnosis into the same box are not suffering from either of them she is misinforming people about alot of shit in this video and as a schizofrenic i take that bit to heart i know that was a small part of the context in the video but people whom dont suffer from theese things watching might take those facts with them out into world,NOT
ahh i know vegans can be very intimidating but i do my best with my videos as you know trish to make them fun and helpful for vegans andor meat eaters just some foodspiration for all ,NOT
stop pushing your agenda on the peoples of the world,NOT
it would be best that tried it for a month also dont treat it like a diet make it a lifestyle just start out trying find eating what makes you full and satisfied and see how that affects you then fine tune for weight loss and never cut too deeply into calories or you will get into selfdefeating yoyo mode finally dont do freelees fruitarian diet that just lacks variety eat a broad base of whole foods and you will do a lot better,NOT
i want to know the reasons why someone would dislike this video is there something that wasnt accounted for or is it inaccurate,NOT
and if you spend all day making mud pies it is a lot of work but it is also completely useless  ben,NOT
and shane was using a vegan meat substitute in the rainbow taco diy video he put out today,NOT
woah i was pleasantly surprised this wasnt a feminazi,NOT
   no more explanation,NOT
if for the same work women only make  cents for every dollar a man makes why dont businesses hire only women  men are usually face discomfort viewing women in positions of power let alone giving them the said positions if you only hired women then theyll be your entire workforce and youll have to listen to what the say for example if they demand salary inclease you wouldnt have a choice but to give it to them but if you have fewer women or a lot of women under the influence of more powerful men women cant demand anything because they are easily and cheaply replaceable,ABU
you really think if these greedy corporations could get the same job done by paying less they wouldnt do it its like saying why sports person makes more money than a teacher simply because they bring in the revenue,NOT
and that only lasted a week ,NOT
of course they had an unfair advantage,ABU
  ,NOT
doesnt seem like a wage gap at all the way it was explained its appropriate pay for time in different sectors,NOT

this makes some sense,NOT
yayyy trish so happy for you thanks freelee for being such a good influence your videos are also helping me im taking baby steps but so far so good p,NOT
radical feminists get destroyed,NOT
the major thing about the wage gap is that it is false taking the average of anything is not scientific ill play the average game on the opposite side on average men do more overtime take less time off dont take parental leave without losing their job and are better negotiators taking the initial salary of somebody is pure bs because its up to the employer im too tired of writing these to not press the shoeonhead button,NOT
question who are you to tell someone their identity  hey guys its me blair making a video about trisha paytas to get these views adds that promo  hey buy my merch anyways back to the video dislike,NOT

what a revolting pair,ABU
your diet choice doesnt matter vegan vegetarian etc it is about input and output what helps you lose weight is burning more calories than you consume thats science of course a well rounded diet whether its vegan vegetarian whatever is best and staying active as well freelee is very active so yes she can eat alot of calories you also have to consider metabolism life stressors things like that affect weight loss and gain,NOT

honestly even if you cant go completely vegan all the time im still proud of you i just hope you keep putting good foods in your body that will make you feel good goodluck,NOT
valid points on both sides really okay how about this a worldclass boxer of the caliber of say manny pacquiao decides he identifies as a woman and starts hormone therapy now knowing hes going to lose a little in the process he steps up his training regimen to stay in the best shape he can one year later hes tested and his testosterone levels are down enough and is given the okay to fight he steps into the ring with the best natural female boxer in his weight class and they fight whats going to happen,NOT
i think any hypothesis about a subject including this one should be discussed openly and objectively what bothers me is the feeling i get from reading all the comments most of you think the problems that women who call themselves feminists talk about are not true most of the people who comment are very supportive of rigid gender lines and responsibilities and i dont label myself anything i am myself some people may call me a feminist but im a human being who is trying to express myself and freely be myself without hurting anyone the fact that i am a women should not exclude me from any profession it should not force me to be feminine it shouldnt force me to have children again i think most of the people who comment here would want all these things to restrict me or be denied to me its very disturbing,NOT
globalist propaganda veganism is part of agenda  dont let them control what u eat but dont buy factory meatbuy local farmer meat,NOT
i think you are just sick of how men treat women how society makes us think we have to look a certain wayguys dont have as much pressure i am female and love gay men i think because they are more sensitive i have very few female friends because it is always a competition i dont like them women like to tear others done to make themselves feel better i also feel like a man somedays but that just low self esteem it is easier being a man when it comes to looks and stuff i think you are confusing these normal feelings with being transgender you are tired of putting on a show best of luck,NOT
exactly by saying that men earn  to  is basically saying that men work harder so they earn more females chose different paths and as a result get lesser pay,NOT
if piers morgan was told that the vegan sausage roll was real meathe would say it was nicebut the stupid pratt is so against veganism and hates anything thats vegan it just goes to show what an absolute idiot he is,ABU
wow as a conservative i expected to dislike the video from vox this wasnt too bad,NOT
why does she record on the kitchen floor,NOT
as any woman working in a science lab will tell you correlation does not prove causation so its nice to say women get paid less because they have babies but not all women have children not all women are the primary caregiver and the wage gap still exists it might factor in but a survey will never ever prove a causal relationship and honestly the wait until youre  when your wages will match and shes just also raising a family are flimsy excuses anyway by the time wages level out later in life the man who was making  more than a woman in the same position will have a much larger savings retirement and pool of assets than the woman so thats bull pucky you shouldnt have to wait until nearly retirement to get paid fairly try again,NOT
why you ask such a stupid question you cant ask somebody a question that you know i know the fucking world knows that the answer is based on their bias and not facts,NOT
as a trans guy myself i think theres a huge difference than being trans and not really feeling like a woman i personally cant speak on your feelings but j think you need to do you reserch so many people who think theyre trans but arent because of other issues that they believe could be fixed my being different gender for instance you being attracted to gay men doesnt mean your a gay guy you just happened to be attracted to some of the qualities they have i think that its awesome to try out new pronouns and to experiment but i dont believe in just going straight in and coming out as a trans guys i think one thing for me that really makes me confused about this is the fact that youve gotten multiple breast jobs to enhance your boobs as a trans guy that would absolutely kill me you can obviously do whatever you want and i hope you well in your transition but i think you need to do way more reserch and figure out if you want to become a man not just a drag queen,NOT
she literally probably watches drag race where she loves all the gay black guysshe wants to be a gay black trans guy who does drag,NOT
hey freelee you should watch pewdiepies newest video why pewdiepie is the dumbest youtuber it kinda revolves around veganism idk if it is meant to but it kinda does,NOT

there is a wage gapbut not in hourly positions as by law they are all equal payed positions however there is a gender and even racial wage gap once you enter into management level there is a gap there but i feel no sympathy for such people as most of america is under the poverty line so even when they are stiffed they still make more a month then most do in three,NOT

is it possible for youtube comments to be constructive instead of pure hate speech an openminded person will not insult others but discuss and improve,NOT
why dont transgenders race against each other if they want to be fair and equal just like how most transgenders end up having relationships with each other,NOT
this is the best video,NOT
this sooo good thank you plant based news for existing,NOT
this is facepalm inducingly obvious i cant believe were still talking about this anyone who is honest with themselves about the biological differences between men and women and their priorities men are ambitious status seeking women are all about relating to others will get it without issue only the biology deniers eg those who think women are as strong as men will continue to push this dumb narrative re wage gap,NOT
wait but after you said you accounted for career choice hours and all that stuff you said there was still a  gap thats still a wage gap,NOT
you left out the part where she says you being nice to her helped instead of making mean videos,NOT
really this is where humanity goes probably good time to die out if i say i am  year old boy will i compete with them if i say i am not that fat will i fight in lighter category how much do common sense need to step back for those creatures they feel like women whatever they can act like them they can have female names but they wont be females gender is not something you pick its biological fact,ABU

gender stereotypes are not gender im sick of hearing it,NOT
vox is a fake news propaganda machine  you should not be showing up in my feed youtube is not for mainstream media,NOT
if the wage gap exist why would businesses hire more men if they could pay women less if you could get away with this  cents to dollar crap then wouldnt all the women be hired first,NOT
it kinda sounds like non binary  from the way she talks and non binary falls under the transgender umbrella,NOT
the little tiny shred of respect i had for her was just destroyed  wtf is wrong with her,NOT
i believe the small gap observed in those studies is due to not controlled variables such as negotiation skills and risk aversion men are just more aggressive than women on the labor market we take more chances and expose ourselves more we are more willing to risk stability for higher compensation elsewhere needless to say those variables are hard to control,NOT
the wage gap looks at the average pay for men and women without having in count the personal choices vacacions promotions time worked plus it only looks at full time jobs and thats why it is a myth,NOT
you go girl mega thumbs up on going vegan from here stick with it you will love it    as for freelee thumbs down no excuse suffice when it comes to her recent behavior there are plenty awesome kickass smaller vegan source youtubers out there gogogo my fav for simple easy yummy recipeesideas of what to eat high carb hannah the vegan solution simply quinoa cooking with plants remember you can basicly eat everything you used to just veganise it i eat homemade veggi burgers weekly they are so awesome weight wise the less processed you eat the better though most vegans disagree with you being able to eat unlimited dont starve yourself by any means but dont overeat or stuff yourself either best of luck ,NOT

so do dogs have brains or nah,NOT
drag queen isnt a gender,NOT
the wage gap was debunked way back in the seventies and thats not to mention how much extra support women get in terms of scholarships and grants for their education that men have little to no access to,NOT
im all about boobs that was hella uncomfortable for me to say btw hello im lyam im transgender ftm if you are able to say boobs and say youre girly or say that you were female at birth is absolute bullsht if you were able to say thoes words without feeling dysphoric hate to say it but youre not transgender youre just an sjw that is in it for the fame and money because you get paid to make these videos that means youre basically using the lgbtq trans community for money and your own comfort we fought long and hard for our spot today we get harassed and bullied for being who we are some of us even commit sucide because we dont feel comfortable in our body this is really fucked up of you if you were trans and had the freedom to transition you would have done it by now quit the bullshit and stop making the trans community look stupid,ABU
this world is going to hell fast,NOT
how is this so hard for the public to realize there is no wage gap nobody in there right mind would pay others less or more based on their gender the only gap would be based on there physical and or mental capabilities but there is no gap in reality it is a factor on a few different things that cause the wage gap it is the fact that women end up not choosing fields that earn them as much for an obvious example there are many more male doctors than female and on the other side there are many more female nurses than male nurses they both are in the same field but there is a clear difference on what they end up choosing also if you ask a lot of girls on what they want to be ones that choose medical fields end up saying i want to be a nurse much more than i want to be a doctor that is the equivalent of somebody saying that they want to be a copilot maybe that comparison was different but there is an obvious correlation in all fields with this just like you will see a lot more hostess at restaurant than hosts female  hostess another besides that is the effort it would take for females to do certain tasks such as heavy lifting ones or dirty ones clearly men go into that field because they are genetically by far better and they would need  or more women to complete a task than  man for most cases i can go on with a lot of details but the last would be things like maternity leave causing them to literally miss work for months because they had a child which is understandable but if you want that to be on your options you need to take less pay or you just dont get paid leave,NOT
or you can just look at individuals and find that its all about individual life choices and not a conspiracy against women you can compare the salaries of men and there will be differences as well and as far as the baby stuff that is a choice you make not society keeping you down its a choice i made im a stay at home dad is this society sexist against men because when i rejoin the work force i wont be making as much as those who stayed in it,NOT
boys are faster and stronger then girls  dun dunn dunnnn,NOT

maybe because of pregnant leave and all the time spent on their phones and gossiping with other coworkers during working hours,ABU
these statistics are completely irrelevant if you dont consider time worked or what type of work done,NOT
you eat whole foods till your satiated you can not pack in all the vegan foods with no exercise and expect results,NOT
good work all of your and thank you for all you do,NOT
thanks you for being objective but is any of this accounting for how women on average work less hours overall or are less likely to push for longer hours and promotions and what about manual labor any kind of gap would be generated by the fact that there are significantly less women in those fields but im sure findings will reveal that on an hour to hour basis the place to begin that women make exactly as much by the hour seeing as anything other then equal pay is illegal and institutions and organizations exist to enforce that the gap is misrepresenting the stats by the fewer collective hours otherwise the bbb or someone would be stepping in which goes to show you cant fix something that isnt broken if i could fix anything it would be that feminism would be defined as superiority instead of equality since its not about equality its about revenge things were so unequal for so long that now they have to be unequal the otherway instead of balanced like they should,NOT
there is  triggered feminazis on this video,ABU
shes gotta be trolling that was so bad,NOT
transgender people have dysphoria if you do not have disphoria then you are not trans and dismorphia and dysphoria are two very different things you can be a masculine female without being trans you can be a feminine man without being trans trish please talk to people who are trans legit people who are trans because i know you are hurting so many people because you are calling yourself trans when you arent,NOT
more woman in america like her please,NOT
its just wrong  boys competing against girls,ABU
look at mommy tangs channel shes a vegan youtuber that is the queen of mukbangs she includes recepie in her mukbang too,NOT
when will this bs die off the differences are not existent when you take someone in the same profession working in the same part of the world to eliminate regional differences in pay and labors laws the feministics twist this truth to suit them by combining the earnings of all men and women without regard for age profession or any other factors obviously an engineer is going to earn more than a teacher and a doctor is going to earn more than them thats just how it is considering the fields men and women work in due to their own interests and dreams we find that women tend to work as teachers nurses etc which are not very high paying jobs but come with a social component and are much lighter on the workload men tend to take more stressful and dangerous jobs  ranging from mining sewage engineering offshore work and more they are obviously much more strenuous and dangerous to ones life and limb but are crucial for civilization to function hence their pay is equally large by explicitly avoid this piece of common sense these feminists are peddling lies openly and people still buy it its annoys me to no end that people are not using their brains even a little bit if you paid a doctor only as much as a regular office worker why would anyone go through the years long hell and massive risk to be a doctor same with engineers miners and so on,NOT
says im a guy proudly shows off tits to get more views in different videos,NOT
i dont have a problem with them being transgender although i do think people should be who they are born to be i have a problem with them taking victorys in sports in which physical men excel in while the true woman champion gets rd instead of st its freken logic for goodness sakes,NOT
men have better paid jobs than women quick we have to put more women in better paid jobs for the sake of equality there are more men homeless than women quick we have to put more women in streets for the sake of equality,NOT
they are men,ABU
how bout this shit for equality lmfao almost as good as watching bitches that hit men get knocked the fuck out,ABU

i identify as a rich person but in reality my bank dont agree with me send cash to my cash app ronnierabell so im not discriminated by society,NOT
more people should be listening to christina hoff sommers on this topic not milo yiannoupoulis she says brilliant things without feeling the need to bring every ounce of attention to herself ruining the legitimacy of her arguments with the inflammatory nature of her ego  which is what milo does guess what dude when you say things like if women had been the predominant gender in the world throughout history instead of men wed all still be living in grass huts you arent really going to get very far in an argument about equality,NOT
bro woke people in the comment section now using science xd when is not good for woman they instantly change their mind xd,NOT
what vox is really trying to tell is that women should get more than their male counterparts even if they are in the office or not whether they leave the office early or not present when clients need them instead they should be paid for staying homefantastic thinking vox,NOT
awesome video prager u helped me to become a conservative im a brazilian student and by the way thanks for portuguese subtitle,NOT

im a  year old girl i get mistaken for a guy because i have a boyish pixie and baggy mens clothes i dont wear makeup that doesnt make me less female im just more masculine,NOT
even in porn they have categories just an example as funny as it sound they have an award for best female pornstar and an award for best shemale pornstar if they wanna compete the state should create another category for transgenders female or male im sure that will be more fair and thats not discrimination it just common sense,NOT
this makes me so happy my top vegan tip beans they are so good for you and if youre worried abput protein that helps theres lots of vegan mexican food bean soups etc and hummus will go great with those carrots i also hope you know that this could be the start of a great chain reaction as someome who was so far from vegan and somewhat against it to try it now will help open a lot of those kinds of peoples minds and your friends too because you and some of your friends if they try it too have such a big audience you will reach a lot of people and help the animals so much,NOT
frustrates me david attenborough is not a vegan,NOT
has everyone lost their dang minds this is ridiculous these are boys whether they want to be or not,ABU
democrats are now officially insane cant wait for the olympics more teachable moments democrats are idiots socialist idiots,ABU
when a woman leaves the workforce to have children have you factored in that the male has to work extra during that period to try and cover some of the earnings loss,NOT
what people miss answer  the fact that its made up propaganda based off of an inability to actually read statistics in a correct and educated manner,ABU
trisha just wants a label for herselfinvolving with the lgbtq community gotta get dat clout some way or the other wannabespecial,NOT
ive been waiting for this vid with baited breathyou did not disappoint ,NOT

if this woman ever runs for president shes got my vote,NOT
common sense has left the chat,ABU
you missed the fact that men are more likely to take risks at work for that reason men are more likely to both become millionaires or commit suicidebecome homeless,NOT
go watch beautytakenin has a video for vegans,NOT

wait your argument is that there cant be a pay gap because if there were companies would only hire women lol,NOT
roses are red violets are blue i came looking for hate comments and id bet you did too,NOT
this channel is devolving into a trainwreck,NOT
do worry trisha all these guys are clearly being rude so lemme give you some encouraging words  youre a trashcan not a trashcannot and you trashcan leave the internet huntie,NOT
there is no wage gap men do harder more dangerous and physical jobs therefore men get paid more you ppl cant be this stupid,NOT
so if theres anything i got from this its that men are lazy and leave the mothers to take care of the children so they make less money right am i right,NOT
im so glad you talked about nonbinary being just a fad sadly my  yo granddaughter has a best friend who identifies as nonbinary and it has caused my granddaughter to vehemently defend this as a thing now i absolutely love her friend because shes really sweet and often talks my granddaughter off her hormonal cliffs i just wish shed be who she really is im hopeful though she actually joined dance with my granddaughter though her primary athletic interest is roller derby but its cool to see her at least exploring something more feminine she doesnt even use her feminine name and only goes by a nickname that is genderless she also calls it gender neutral vs nonbinary but i think thats basically the same thing at least it seems to be,ABU
am i vegan yes  do i eat meat and dairy on a daily basis yes ,NOT
i know this an extreme analogy but what if lebron tomorrow decided to identify as female and he wants to play in the wnba he probably go down as the greatest ever lmao ring on top of ringsits riduclous to allow that and so is this shit,ABU
literally you make no sense,NOT
can you please do a video on jillian michaels she is always promoting meat and dairy consumption when she is a well known personal trainer and is influencing millions of people,NOT
because a lot of male workers also attracts more business in a male dominated world,NOT
i particularly agree but it sometimes does happen,NOT
vegan what i eat in a day videos helped me so so much in the beginning ,NOT
one reason is agreeableness when my dad wanted more money for his work he demanded a raise when my mom wanted more she passively waited for them to give her a raise,NOT
yeah trish welcome to the vegan family  c yes im also vegan c,NOT
what in the actual fuck you should quit yt forever for the sake of humanity,NOT
still the questions remains why do women make those different choices a lot of those choices in college major number of hours worked etc are influenced by the fact that women are still expected to be homemakers even if both parents work fulltime countless studies show that when a mother and father both work mom does the majority of the housework and childrearing this could partly be due to biology where women are more inclined to nurture their children giving you the benefit of the doubt but it is undoubtedly largely thanks to societal pressure and cultural norms,NOT
love you blaire i was waiting for this obv shes trolling theres no way shes trans  no one was talking about her and her cross eyed tits so she had to come up with something to get attention i think shes hilarious but is she trans no way,ABU
i stopped eating dairy because of my acne and it got soooo much better,NOT
great video annoying comments stopping bashing each other geez,NOT
finally someone with common sense,NOT
holly shit prager u seems to have gotten something right wow just wow of course they didnt get here through a critical analysis of evidence but rather because in this one case the evidence does not contradict their political narrative seeeerrriously can we dispense with fake universities now or should we elect another con artist president or two first,NOT
broccoli holds more protein than steak so you could try that but not many loves broccoli beans are great im so excited for you to go vegan,NOT
sms bish wat,NOT
even if the wage gap did exist why would anyone want to be a feminist in todays age good and true feminism died in the s now feminism is about man hating egalitarianism is the way to go,NOT
random side note although conservatives are annoyed with it im still surprised to see blair eating and promoting chic file as they actively fund anti lgbt groups aka anti blair i was like whatever when i thought it was just the owner saying he doesnt agree with gay people but once i found out my money would indirectly be going to anti lgbt groups thats when i stopped going to chic file,NOT
im gonna need a gif of im deceased,NOT
watching this video made me think of becoming vegan i have turned vegetarian not so long ago however i am always picked on my family about it my family are meat eaters and im only in my early teens meaning i cant control much on what i eat im thinking to become vegan when i move out but thats might be in many years in the future which is too long idk what to do,NOT
did she just assume their gender,NOT
why so much backlash i thought you didnt have to transition or pass or even idenitify with the opposite gender to be trans you just say you identify youre all so hateful sarcasm and not directed at blaire of course,NOT
wrong in so many ways,ABU
there are zero differences between men and women why are there even  genders there is absolutely no biological differences between men andy women nope absolutely none cant tell the difference no amount of sciencing has ever found any difference,NOT
it wasnt pre recorded because she made jokes and made a comment about how this video is not for vegans to watch she knew she was going to get backlash yet she didnt care and last why would she make that remark if it was prerecorded,NOT
so if women would just stop having kids and work a little bit harder we dont have to listen to them complain that theyre lazy and they like having kids and staying at home if my wife wanted to go to work and work long hours while i stay at home with the kids i would gladly make less money than a woman does,NOT
wow thank you for opening my mind no joke when i clicked on this i said to myself ima gonna lose some brancells but you really explained it well and helped me understand thanks,NOT
freelees body is the result of over  years vegan and riding a bike km every single day it took her years to get that body you may actually end up gaining weight over the next  weeks because of metabolic damage rather than loose weight so just be wary of that i hope you stay vegan after the  weeks because you will notice that you will feel better and have more energy and of course you will be supporting the lives of animals but in saying that you might not loose any weight,NOT
is a vocal fry required to be a white feminist,NOT
so basically the wage gap mainly comes from the number of hours worked thus the main cause of the wage isnt sexism,NOT
they both just gays and like to dress like females,ABU
love you trisha,NOT
fake information just conservative bs,NOT
yes yes yesss im so proud of you you dont just have to eat fruit get some rice beans lentils potatoes and other yummy carbs p good luck ,NOT

when they pulled the baby cow away from the mom i bawled how could someone be so cruel i just cant believe it its so sad,NOT
liberal media supporting them again,NOT
i still have no idea why tp is watched by anyone i cant eye roll enough when i even hear her name let alone her speaking,NOT
yes im so so so excited for you,NOT
a lot of women get paid less than men bc theyre willing to work for less and they sometimes work fewer hours to take care of their kids or something now thats not a problem at all but its true,NOT
yay good luck,NOT
so allowing her to be who she wants to be holds more weight than an actual female losing the medal,NOT
good video in a long time,NOT
also please go watch the documentary cowspiracy on netflix it is really really eye opening  there is no gruesome livestock footage x,NOT
the first thing i thought when i saw trishas video was i hope blair makes a video on this youre always on it sis,NOT
people mad that they slow or that they kids slow ,NOT
so your basically non binary,NOT
very valid points but it doesnt hit the mark it explains a few reasons why women are generally paid less and also fails to mention the main  reasons women typically make more straight out of college for the same job up until they decide to start up a family,NOT
lmao those dislikes feminists be like butmuh oppreshun,NOT
ive been a vegan for almost seven years now and am still going strong but i dont buy into all of the climate change propaganda its agenda driven nonsense,NOT
i lean left on most issues but this video makes a lot of sense,NOT
that bimbo trisha questioned if dogs have a brain because they dont talk i think right there  case closed ,ABU
good on you freelee,NOT
so because women dont want to work odd hours we should make ice cream shops and law firms close earlier that makes no sense a woman is just as capable as a man of working shitty hours if women dont think its worth it thats their choice,NOT
how old is this video stay away from freelee she is poison,ABU
im vegan  months ago and its fucking amazing its hard a little bit in the beginning but then ur body will use to that rhythm u feel healthy and thats the best feeling ever,NOT

she is literally insane i dont even think she is educated does she know what dysphoria is,ABU
she cant eat chicken when shes sober minded aka she can eat chicken almost every day of the week,NOT
so what this is saying is that to end the wage gap a night job must pay the same as a day job and risky jobs must pay the same as safe jobs and remove the overtime extra pay sorry but that looks a bit unfair thanks for clearing up what you want done to end the wage gap,NOT
if u switch to vegetarian try morning star farm products they are delicious ,NOT
i destroyed  feminists and my teacher in our econ class thank you,ABU
seems like garbage,NOT
women take on a disproportionate share of child rearing tasks by their own choice this is the thing that all of these analyses ignore people make individual choices about what they want for their own lives and those choices affect how likely they are to get promoted people have different personalities and those differences affect how likely they are to get paid more or get promoted on average women choose to stay home with children more than men on average women are more agreeable when in entry level positions and focus more on relationships rather than quantifiable results these are facts and they predict success in the workplace it is not sexism it is individual choices about worklife balance,NOT
chickpeas tofu kale,NOT
soif i decide to become a model right now  i am male  overweight according to feminists can i demand the same payment as the angels from victoria secrets in order to do not have a wage gap ,NOT
women cant compete with men its biology if you allow this youre gonna get men who cant medal in the olympics getting sex changes and stealing medals in every event a junior hockey team of yr old boys beat the gold medal winning canadian womens hockey team how can anyone think that this will ever work fairly,ABU
yes i agree its sexism and the p envy buy a strap on with those ad sense coins and call it a day im fucking rolling on the ground laughing so hard girl you are funny,ABU
women tend to take more time off work and take more breaks off work and ask for raises less and they tend to work in fields with less paying jobs,NOT
this is so stupid if u are born a boy run with people like you dont cheat,ABU
i just found this but thank you for clearing up the description of the wage gap i heard this statistic told over and over and found it impossible to believe that the majority of people today would willingly keep a womans wage lower than a mans they just wouldnt get away with it today,NOT
ive been waiting for this and im so late but amen,NOT
lasted  seconds most annoying voice eveeeeeeerrrrrrrr,NOT
never thought this day would come so great,NOT

if i wasnt vegan already for years i would have been now great film hope more people see the truth and help save the planet and their healt,NOT
i didnt like getting attention from adults as a child so im trans,NOT
i agree with you shes probably trolling i highly doubt shes actually a trans guy love the female to female reference not sure who started it but i remember hearing it on one of kalvins okder videos i think its hilarious and i love the video as always,NOT
people can be nonbinary or gender fluid without seeking attention its more validation and its also not a fad i just think there just wasnt a term for it before and now that there is people are using it what trish is doing on the other hand is for attention unfortunately for her is shes trolled and cried wolf so many times no one takes her seriously or even actually cares anymore,NOT
what happened to the part where she said ur a bitch in the end ,NOT
it is unfair its basic biology that men are physically stronger than women even if they are trans that trans women is going to keep that physically strength she has from when she was a man,ABU
vegan since  months now  and never felt better  follow my igaccount for food inspiration   veganbolism,NOT
so women do more work at home and get paid less so are men supposed to be breadwinners or homemakers you can have one or the other not both thats just kinda how equality works,NOT
i can hear the feminists screaming   ,NOT
this video is what we needed it proves that there is no gap in salary for men and women working for the same time we may not have attained equality in all aspects of life and society but it dosent mean that we dont need to pick our fights i think that is part of the reason modern feminists are seen as radical and such however i dont know about the situation outside of the states and canada so i cannot be sure about it,NOT
hey freelee just wondering if u could do a video on how to help anaemic people,NOT
yea they miss the fact that its a myth,NOT
jobs with higher risk and uncertainty are more paid men have a tendency to be riskier than women,NOT

this entire documentary is based on lies,NOT
if you are comfortable with the gender you were born with you arent trans,NOT
of course cheats dont see themselves as cheats no surprise there then,NOT
we could tackle this problem indirectly by guaranteeing paid maternitypaternity leave sick leave and vacation time for all full time workers,NOT
i eat jack in the box when i watch freelee lmao,NOT
im a lesbian with feelings for a straight girl does that mean im a straight guy no no it doesnt it just makes me sad,NOT
how can anyone deny this,NOT
was gonna say trisha is just a troll lmao,NOT
the fact that this is a debate is concerning,NOT
youre my favorite youtuber  keep it up,NOT
im curious are all your friends and family vegan,NOT
please do a what i eat in a day,NOT
this is the most problematic thing ive ever seen  this is the i cant get clout from the vlog squad anymore so lets just impose on an entire society that has come so far but i want attention,ABU
thanks for making us look crazy,NOT
thank god that people in the comments in this braindead video do have a brain,NOT
ugly lowlife cheaters with zero self respect or a clue about fairness or community theyre out for self just like their sniveling excuses for parents theyll go nowhere and accomplish nothing but in their wake theyll leave a bunch of females whove worked hard broken hearted and possibly without a scholarship or other offers these things dont practice or workout to get better they dont have to how about putting in the work and joining the mens track team like the other men nah much easier to act like a girl and win easily while getting all of the attention you obviously never got from your douche parents who are these people that put up with this shit if they tried it at my school theyd both have a suspicious limp before every meet time to stop taking it up the ass from these fucking freaks,ABU
all i got from this is that the professions men prefer are compensated better sounds sexist to me,NOT
trisha female to male also trisha male to female,NOT
you cant compare self employed men and women because men are more likely to take risks its proven,NOT
i think it has something to do with the fact that women arent pressured as much as men to work men are waaaayyy more pressured to have money in their pockets so it makes sense they would go for the jobs that pay more sex is also a motivator for men to have money theres still a whole slew of women in the world who aspire to be housewives it doesnt mean women are less ambitious  some nurses works  hour shifts we just have different levels of whats comfortable,NOT
i havent been this happy in months so glad youre going vegan,NOT
she deadass kills me  how does she even keep a straight face saying all this random shit,NOT
freely you and harley are why i went vegan two years ago i love you guys no matter ,NOT
good for you girl  tips be open to the fact that the vegan version of foods isnt supposed to taste exactly like the animal version chicken nuggets are their own delicious treat as is coconut yogurt soy milk soy cream vegan cheese vegan cookies also most bread pizza dough crackers etc are vegan if you want delivery pizza order it with sauce and veggies and add your own vegan cheese or toppings at starbucks ask for soy milk or coconut milk instead in fraps or any drink sorbet ice cream is dairy free oreos are vegan there is a vegan version of just about any food and its fun to try also there are so many vegan tumblr blogs with a ton of ideas and simple recipes that really helped me when i went vegan finally do it at your own pace if you have a set back and eat an animal product dont condemn yourself and let it turn into a binge forgive yourself and continue on hugs xo,NOT
if you doing it to lose weight for  weeks then maybe you will have better results from the atkins diet for quick weight loss but i think been vegan for two weeks then why not commit to it  percent your title says you going vegan but you said only for  weeks why not commit and become fully vegan if you going down that route i tried it out for  months few years ago was nice but yeah i eat meat still no hate thanks why  weeks only become vegan for life ,NOT
trish you can ask at starbucks for then to make your fraps with coconut milk soy milk and it is dairy free i do this all the time and im a vegan and i need my starbucks,NOT
but you cant tell this to any of the feminists now a days because then it would be their responsibility to make the right choices and their entire movement is all about denying responsibility they claim that women in this country have no autonomy by pretending that they dont have it they want to escape their accountability by throwing their problems onto a nonexistent enemy who has a supposed advantage or privilege that they dont when in fact that supposed enemy makes their own choices with what to do with their lives and either accept the benefits or live with the consequences,NOT
lowkey waiting for freelee to make a vid,NOT

trish youve said a lot of things on the internet but this is the first time ive actually been shocked ,NOT
really proud of you,NOT
not a bad documentary and im really happy that it doesnt only highlights the positive side but also talks about possible arguments against veganism and disproves them afterwards but ive got the feeling that its mostly focussing on the economical part although i think it would be much more beneficial to shed light on the concrete impacts on our environment i see the focus here mostly on famous representatives of the vegan communities and less on the actual reasons why people should go vegan nevertheless i think it is awesome that youtube has now free documentaries as well and that even the ones without netflix can inform themselves about the plantbased diet,NOT
thank you vox for making the sources for all of this easier to see by putting them in the description,NOT
she was also on twitter last night posting nudes  clearly fine with her female body also didnt she get a boob job,NOT
i still dont know what a sausage roll is,NOT

girl vegan is easy but it can be scary to start just eat rice pasta to fill you up with any veggies you like but its good to add some greens plus if you want to add the fake meats you can,NOT
vegan a very very good thing for our planet but these other spinners this friday for future are hypocrites and ecofascists have not yet seen one of those demonstrating in front of a slaughterhouse  but there it would be appropriate,NOT
freelee can shut the fuck now smh,ABU

soooo because i let my zits go and because i dont give two shits about my hair half the time im suddenly a male mhm okay honey,NOT
so great im so proud of you my advice start following some vegans on instagram for some inspiration and delicious recipes ,NOT
so why are traditionally femaledominated occupations lower paying than traditionally maledominated ones ie why do trades people engineers and lawyers making more than teachers social workers and nurses is it because men once ruled almost the entire workforce and put more value on their own strengths and less on femaleoriented ones such as caring for others this systematic inequality has been perpetuated over the years its not just about the choices females make its about what we value in our workforce that has been dictated to us decades ago by men,NOT
i like how she has to title it female to male because everyone is gonna say to themselves ah that explains it,NOT

you can do it trisha,NOT
the great tennis champion martina navratilova trained by playing against her coach a man ranked around th in the world at the time she never took a set from him not once therefore it can be safely assumed that there are hundreds of men today who cant hang with djokovic or nadal but can easily beat the top women in the sport inevitably one of these men will think to himself i can keep on teaching beginning lessons for peanuts at this country club or i can call myself a woman tour the world and make a fortune i look forward to the brouhaha that will ensue when that happens,ABU
females get paid way more than they shouldthey are worth about a quarter of men,ABU
i respect you very much for being open with the way you feel on this topic and sharing your views i believe you said this all very well and it stinks you cant do it without getting backlash from others,NOT
what when did chicken become vegan lol,NOT
how can you take what she saying seriously when she cant even state facts correctly not to mention willfully leaving out key parts of the argument when she says men make  and women make  less that means they make  what she meant to say is they make  of what men make at that time which was the  she told us  if she cant understand that what she said is wrong in a heavily funded and scripted show how can we take anything she says seriously how can someone someone mess up presenting facts to people she clearly isnt used to looking at facts and breaking down statistics like educated people do i wouldnt put it past her if she doesnt read statistics because they almost always go against traditional liberal beliefs,ABU
also why does the number always change somewhere like its  cents  cents  cents like m ake up your fuckig mind,NOT

great vid xxden,NOT
anyone arguments against im interested certainly sources please,NOT
massive tomboy with some girly intentions,NOT
i like some of prager us videos but the hypocrisy in this one really bothered me to me it clearly demarcates the true bias that our shortsighted society has against women and true femininityand its not the kind of bias that feminists propound we still live in a mans world remember that song where womens skills and interests which tend to be verbal and nurturing rather than the stem fields and womens call to be homemakers and to care for children and family members just arent valued economically it really is unfair many women and yes many men too spend countless hours giving unpaid care to children the handicapped sick and elderly our society expects this more and more doctors are releasing patients who need  nursing and can even prosecute someone who does not care for a family member but then we hypocritically turn around and blame womens choices because theyre not as singleminded about a career as men do you realize how much our society depends on unpaid people many of them women to check on the elderly in nursing homes to take care of sick people to call insurance companies and wrangle with doctors offices to care for autistic kids and small children our society could not afford to pay people to do what lots of moms do every day but this work has to be done and you cant trust that a hireling will always really give your loved one individualized care which is critically important for babies and young children what this video also shows it that in order to make a mans wages a woman has to somehow truly transgender herself she has to somehow be able to change her brain which is different from a mans and be able to think and act like a man and have the singleminded careerdrive of a man or be penalized economically this really puts women in an emotionally painful position and when i was a manager i saw women crying about this either abandon their children in daycare all the time or simply not have children at all then where would our society be in  or  years i realize that part of the problem is due to the work of extreme feminism our society no longer supports the traditional view of the family with husband who has the masculine drive and time to specialize in a career as prime provider with a family wage the change in our economy so that women are now almost forced to work in order for a family to be middleclass is probably the worst thing to ever happen to women honestly although i certainly think that women should have the right and option to choose a career i myself have a masters degree im an extreme conservative and i understand economics one of the areas in which i disagree with conservatism however is when conservatives hide behind the glib statement that people always have a choice yes we all do have certain choices but we do not have a choice as to our sex as well as our race our intelligence level our physical handicaps and how we are programmed biologically oftentimes the dogma of choice is just used by the intelligent the wealthy the lucky the healthy and the otherwise successful to justify why they should be rewarded more  in our society than others who perhaps work just as hard but in jobs or unpaid positions that our society considers to be menial or unworthy of remuneration,NOT
 brianna i totally agree a transgender still has the physical musculature of a man if a woman these two are still boys which gives them a physical advantage against women also cant change the dna no matter how much estrogen is taken its just not fair to the women,ABU
why does this actually make sense to me,NOT
why is eden deffending trishaa wthhh happened to heeeer,NOT

lmao nah they gotta run against the boys thats like me growing into an adult  but then felt like a kid at heart so i wanted to compete against other kids,ABU
this is really offensive in the worse way this is not humor please seek help and think about what youre doing ,NOT
i fully agree with all of this factors involved however dont seem to phase the people who believe in this fallacy freedom of speech is definitely at play and all are welcome to their freedom in that right i would add though that freedom of speech in expressing each opposing idea does not equate to realistic pragmatic fact opinion does not equate to fact appreciate the video keep up the great work,NOT
lol glistening in the sun not wind,NOT
what are you going to do about all your leather goods,NOT

you can still get stuff at starbucks they offer dairy alternatives also you need protein since you wont be getting it from meat and cheese beans legumes nuts if you make up some rice and beans and then toss it in a frying pan with some onion carrots a little garlic and soy sauce is my favourite way to eat beans you also need green vegetables there are all kinds of goodness in green vegetables that we all need kale and spinach are my favourites and an easy quick thing to do is have smoothies for breakfast or lunch i will take some water or some good juice and blend some spinach banana and frozen fruits and its great on the go for a quick pick me up meal accompanied by a snack lately i have been pairing it with watermelon,NOT
trannes in my state ew,ABU

trisha veganism is not a diet it is a lifestyle ,NOT
is this the equality they wanted,NOT

trish i am so proud you are making this video so proud to see someone take this step forward however do not and i mean do not feel pressured by the bullies or the people that leave nasty comments if you feel after  weeks that you dont necessarily like the diet please stop and ignore the people that tell you otherwise its your life babe and its great that youre doing something like this  xoxoxo love you,NOT
gotta love it how vox uses ww showreels to exemplify the amount of women used in hard labor jobs when men were less available because they were drafted to fight wars,NOT
for iron and protein and calcium try to eat things like lentils and potatoes and kale and broccoli and things like this and you can try to not eat  big meals a day you can try to eat many portions of food a day so your digestive system can break the food down easier,NOT
they miss the fact that  when you control for hours worked and productivity and intelligence  its a total  myth,NOT
i am mostly vegan myself but i dont think this is a good film i dont think a daily meat eater feels much incentive to keep watching after the first few minutes minutes or even seconds thats the audience you want to reach right not the people who already agree with you its so judgmental so preachy so condescending the people you are trying to reach hate that,NOT
youtube has pushed all the debunking videos on this far far down in america search results took forever to find one debunking video but a bunch of videos are on top perpetuating the propaganda just had to let that be known youtube aint slick,NOT
honestly if she is doing this for clout im suing if she is gender queer i understand how confusing it is and why she had a hard time explaining this but if she is just saying it bc she is irrelevant or wants to sound woke imma be pissed,NOT

i always gave you the benefit of the doubt but i will neeeever watch another glitter bitch unboxing never watch a trisha video never watching a cola with you im done and poof youre gone  youre not gonna apologize your way outta this one sis just you wait,NOT
i have the exact same reaction as piers morganwhen i ate meat i replayed the part of when he took a bite of plantbased burger or whatever it was his face contorted even before he took a bite most people react with disgust when tasting something they dont likeafter theyve taken a bite he had already made up his mind he wasnt going to like it but his facial expression revealed that it wasnt all that bad but because he had bashed vegan foodand of course because of his narcissistic personality he is belligerent and narrow minded they cant admit when they are wrongtheir way or the highway i went vegetarian in  i went vegan in  i became vegan after cutting out one food after another to figure out what was wrong with me i suffered gastrointestinal issues for years when i cut out dairy i was absolutely staggered at how much better i felt in one week i thought its got to be a fluke so i introduced small amounts of dairy thinking a little wont make any difference all i had was one small in x in x in slice of cheddar cheese i was in unbearable agony all night i had stomach and intestinal cramping that rivaled being in labor it was actually worse than labor because i was in horrible pain the entire night and part of the next day ive never had a childbirth labor last that long i gave my sister the remaining cheddar cheese packageshe isnt veganim the only vegan in my family there are millions of people who are allergic to nuts the food industry now has clear labeling for nut allergies it can be life threatening for some people to consume foods that contain nuts those of us who are severely lactose intolerant have struggled for years to find nondairy substitutes my best friend was vegan and told me about a website that would help me a lot it was peta i was heartbroken disgusted and angry when i looked at videos of farm animals being tortured every day after they suffer unimaginable agonizing pain just so people can have their meat i never really liked the taste of meat it always tasted like blood to me but because my parents were meat eaters i was forced to eat it along with the rest of my family the only way i could eat it was to mix tiny pieces into my mashed potatoes now as a  year old grandma i continue to refuse to enable industries that callously and inhumanly torture farm animals,NOT
 years strong being vegetarian then recently turning vegan a few months ago best decision ever,NOT
transgenders can not join woman in my opinion you have to look at sex and test lvls those transgenders have an unfair advantage against woman,ABU
if a transgender girl beats you in a race its probably because she is better at running than you,NOT
how to you offend an entire community from your title to your thumbnail to the first second of your video to the last and then say i dont want people to be offended btch what,NOT
freelee react too sorsha,NOT
unfair advantage they are the same height and size as the other girls and even have to be highlighted to tell who they are  they are just hating because they are fast ,NOT
the gender pay gap is easily disproved by   the equal pay act of  is a thing and if some one was breaking it and paying women less they would get sued and shut down thats all you need to disprove it,NOT
the two presenters seem afraid of saying what they really think,NOT
yay trisha so happy for you ,NOT
im very happy for you ive been vegan for  months and love it make sure to eat lots of rice pasta and greens you got this,NOT
she looks like shes been dragged though an hedge backwards,ABU
only thing that this video suggests is that women arent as smart or as hard working as man,NOT
sorry my english i have never ever in my life got paid more than my female co workers who has the same seniority level and same kind of work the only time i have got more salary than some others is because i have worked more overtime but the same goes to as women as well i am so sick and tired of man hating feminists or feminists in general who always have to claim obscure things,NOT
shes has a week,NOT
i swear people are so fucking retarded if they said they were going through hormone therapy what does that tell you they are currently boys yes but they are transferring over to the other side and honestly it doesnt matter if they are boys or girls at the end of the day its just a sport thats for entertainment and if anything if it dont apply to you then why even comment negatively about it,NOT
i am so happy for you trish ,NOT
the trans athletes have unfair advantages,NOT

secret to not gaining weight on this diet is simple eat when youre hungry  stop when youre full dont stuff yourself  stop when ur satisfied pretty easy ,NOT
good thing you had a female presenter otherwise it wouldve been mansplaining,NOT
are you going to do a video about how she is no longer vegan,NOT
read for all the answers you need and to add eat whatever and how much you want is sort of a lie to me try to keep your calories still around the recommended  area and eat foods that are easy to digest for you drink lots of water no soda or anything like that keep the sodium low that will help prevent bloating the most and try to keep around below  mg a day  mg at most is best because our bodies arent used to digesting sodium so it clings onto water cells which makes you appear bigger because then that water cant exit your system due to the bloating you can also eat starches like rice potatoes not french fries baked potatoes or even sweet potatoes are the bomb and also oatmeal pasta whole grain but no bread bread has a lot of sodium and it is so hard to digest pasta has nearly no sodium and oatmeal has barely  per serving i would also suggest to have melons and fruit as a lunch like a fruit salad and banana smoothie for lunch after a oatmeal breakfast make it with water though and  calorie sweeteners arent as bad as people think as long as its saccharin and not aspartame with lots of fruit on top  i love pineapple strawberry and blueberry and last but not least you do need to do the tiniest bit of exercise maybe walking around town or around a mall for about an hour a day will help loads okay im done ranting xd remember low fat  less than  g a day is when i feel best high carb  around  is what i usually get in a day and around  calories which is what i et around and low sodium i usually have around  mg a day and about an hour of walking and youll do great i really hope youve read this and if you have please give me feedback by replying if this has helped remember i went from  pounds to my lowest of  so i know what im saying ,NOT
this is vodka btw is my mood  great video blaire,NOT
what the fuck,NOT
no such thing as transgender mental health disorder and nothing more now people will abuse a flawed system that caters to these very sick people biology does not lie running  swimming  wrestling a man is simply created different and will have an advantage every time a very sickly liberal mindset has blinded and lied to the entire world to make this nonsense acceptable,ABU
its also maybe the fact the pharmasutrics are a heavy female led perfession,NOT
i want to be vegan but my entire family including family outside my immediate family eats meat and they all think im crazy,NOT
this isint bulletproof like most people say at least in what is seen in this video alone the real takeaway at least the one i got is that wemen prefer eaiser less time consuming jobs to men the real question then becomes why why do they act this way if its simple biology then it seems as if even though a wage gap does exist its not due to any controllable factors but what if its for another reason what it wemen act this way beacuse of societys expectations if thats the case then there really is still work feminists have to do to make wemen feel more at ease in workplaces personally i think thats not supported at all from what we know about female biology but like she says there are so many variables and answers im not willing to count that argument  out yet,NOT
i think she wants to be a part of something to feel loved seems to be lost soul its sad really i hope she finds the help she needs,NOT
please help me begin how do i start i tend to have anemia quite often thank you,NOT
ummm excuse me but what business school are you talking about where people have an average salary over k just after graduation,NOT
hey blaire im not a constant viewer of your channel but i saw some of your videos and find your opinions quite interesting i dont agree with all of them but hey thats the joy of conversations xd theres one thing in particular i always find puzzling when hearing peoples opinion on the matter and that matter would be men and woman are biologically different especially when it comes to the malefemale brain that is what i believe not based on studies but what i consider common sense each sex has its own good and bad attributes in varying portions and there are people now opposing the idea that there are differences between the two sex however if there is no difference that would contradict a lot of the base argument for their topics if men and woman are the same why make a big deal out of the first female insert job here it was because before women where expected to have overcome bigger hardships that it seemed like a breakthrough to get into male dominant positions if theres no male and female characteristics why do you wish for a female president if theres no difference why is it about time you get one that whole idea is based on the expectation that a woman wouldnt be as cruel as a man and more levelheaded in stressful situations equipping her with positive female traits this contradiction just seems quite obvious and blatntly ignored by those claiming absolute unity of manwoman i would like to hear your opinion on this and perhaps other commenters to get some ideas from different perspectives  btw im neither here or there on this matter i find labels nonsense dont care who you are anyone can do what they want as long as they put effort into it and as long as they dont harm someone else its fine with me,NOT
you are gorgeous,NOT

he raped me using logic to debunk my victim complex,NOT
feminists getting triggered,NOT
tofu is great for protein,NOT
once again kids are the problem,NOT
for wage gap you need to find a man and a woman with the exact same qualifications and exact same working hours in the exact same job and compare them,NOT
i have many female friends who chose to get into different fields and made the same money as men the problem is they fall in love and want to have kids they get emotionally attached as a mother and take breaks which forces them to either stay in current position or take a break from their current job while the men who still shoulder most of the expenses continue to compete for higher wages which makes it appear men make more then women on average the simple truth is it is life choice decisions that affect income on the opposite end of the spectrum i have seen female coworkers who are extremely career oriented and they make higher income in higher positions then other men because they dont care about having kids or have a male partner who works in a lower paying position and is the house husband it all comes down to choices but feminists and gender inequality advocates dont want to hear that also evidence shows that men on average dont live as long as women so go figure,NOT
potatoes rice pasta make sure you stay full trish you can eat lots but it needs to be healthy vegan foods can be just as processed as meats so be wary of anything that comes from a box although they taste delicious and are amazing for when youre craving animal products be cautious of eating only waterdense fruits those are essentially that water and they wont help you feel energetic through the day try potatoespastasricebeans for breakfast and fruits etc for dinner ,NOT
finally some real talk from someone real xoxo,NOT
stop as a trans guy this is not cool at all someone please stop her rn,NOT
honestly i dont respect you or even support you anymore as a trans man you made me feel disgusted and violated so you can just fuck off,ABU
for those who cant tell this is a joke yall so sensitive i,NOT
theres an earnings gap not a pay gap there is a earning gap because women on average do less hours and work less dangerous jobs,NOT
man we will do  damage to this planet earth but  damage to ourselves dont save the planet save yourselves,NOT

muscles are glistening in the wind id buy that shirt,NOT
i bet she will go back eating meat in about  days,NOT
so like im attracted to gay guys so that makes me a trans gay guy,ABU
there is no wage gap there is however an earnings gap as people who do the same job with the same credentials tend to get paid the same amount because regardless of the business owner they want to maximize profits and thus pay their employees as little as possible while still retaining more skilled individuals however if billy works  hour weeks and mandy works  hour weeks one will make more initially and be more likely to receive promotions in the future which results in better wages and thus even greater earnings down the line this is the jist of what many purposefully mislabel as the wage gap as a wage is the rate one is paid hourly not what you earn over a specific amount of time including nonwork hours that is what we call earnings,NOT
her face is so fucked up,ABU
you still sound like dudes,NOT
although i believe the gender wage gap is bullshi and does not exist what is the proof that men are more willing to relocate more willing to ask for raises etc,NOT
i didnt see a trigger warning ,NOT
fact the only people who argue for the wage gap are people who never actually worked a real job,ABU
kalvin garah needs to react to this,NOT
wow good for you,NOT
ooooooooooooooooooooh freelies video income ,NOT
so this video is saying that the wage gap is a myth but then says it exists about  because of womens own poorer choices what a bad argument and how much it ignores societys discouraging attitudes towards women going after careers in the sciences or leadership positions it disregards that sexism exists in the workplace its not anywhere near common sense to say working long hours aka as many as your company wants you too determines your work value when specialized skills and benefits to having a secure and healthy are not even considered as part of a career,NOT
those who claim that the wage gap does depend on more factors then just gender btw i dont believe in the wage gap wil then say that there is still sexism because woman care for children and thus cant work first im sorry to be that guy but biology sort of decided that or god if u like fairytales because woman mentally and physically are better at child caring then men who are better at hard work and hunting for the family to survive and second i believe that just like here in europe families should get paid when a woman cant work so its still fair so when a child is born the man can work and woman gets some money but less and the company the woman works for doesnt have to pay the woman but gets a cut of the money that would go to the woman so the woman wont get fired and thus chaos within the household wont happen and a child can growup with the attention of a mother which it needs,NOT
trishatheres a such difference as identifying with and identifying as,NOT
its simply unfair to women athletes that should be the end of the argument and it should not be allowed running is bad enough but what about boxing mma weightlifting etc etc is a trans woman  male body  allowed to beat the living crap out of a woman this is absolute madness ,NOT

within a healthy balanced diet a man needs around kj kcal a day to maintain his weight for a woman that figure is around kj kcal a day so a man earns more money since he has to eat more than a woman makes sense to me,NOT
feminist   in south korea a feminist lawyer appeared on tv to talk about wage gaps and claimed victims by women however most of her low farm consists of men this is loman if i do it adultery if others do it,NOT
as usual feminist want equality without responsibilities and want to earn more without working or less work these days feminist dont even understand that man put more efforts to earn more man doesnt sit in comfort zone he take risk he takes more pressure sit long hours in work,NOT

if the gender wage gap exist then why arent companys replacing men with women,NOT
aw trish youre so cute im so proud of you,NOT
would a fully transitioned trans male be allowed on the girls team ,NOT
so for women to get paid fairly men trying to negotiate their own pay have to negotiate for their fellow womens pay because what they cant do it themselves ludicrous to think women shouldnt have to do any bargaining when negotiating their pay that when mens contracts get negotiated the womens contracts have to automatically be fulfilled with the same pay without putting forth the same effort the men did kinda goes against same pay for same work ethic,NOT
my first year vegan and managed to get one of my friends to ditch milk and another to turn vegan too,NOT

on the business women point that is essentially an argument that women arent as good at managing businesses if im a ceo guess what i have to schedule my day around work whether im a man or a women and the less i do that the less successful im likely to be at running the business,NOT
remember its not a diet its a lifestyle,NOT
eat tofu its good,NOT
stop calling them girls they are not,ABU
but doesnt this presuppose that income should be the main determinant for choosing a profession it should be a factor but combined with aptitude interest benefit to society etc to ensure people are contributing to society to the best of their individual ability if the data given here is correct the question still isnt why do women choose lower paying jobs or why do women value more things over their job the question is who does our society undervalue femaledominant services compared to maledominant ones and why does the unpaid work of socially important things like child rearing communitybuilding taking care of elders etc fall disproportionately on the shoulders of women,NOT
fruits and vegetables are great for snacking im so proud of u and i think you are going to love this lifestyle change get some grains quinoa is my favorite very high in protein and fiber dont be worried about protein too much but definitely think about b,NOT
i think its sexist i think their jealous a boy does not run faster then girls if everyones saying its not fair cause their bos its crazy maybe the girls shoukd practice more d,NOT
so women should have to take certain in many cases less paying jobs just to close the wage gap closing the wage gap is great and needs to be done but restricting the jobs women should take doesnt really achieve the overarching goal,NOT
this just sounds like theres way too many options in the world transgenderism has been glamourized so much lately through the media and now people who would have never even thought about it are questioning if that could be them so now we have a very girly woman saying that shes a transgendered gay man drag queen edit the transgender community is calling to everyone nowadays because its become the popular thing it seems wonderful by the current portrayal,NOT
no needbto explain yourself if ur trans and gay and like being beautiful in a femme way then like fuck it thats ywho you are you never owe anyone an explanation to anyone,NOT
trisha is basically myself if i were immature and im  i wish i were a guy yet i identify with my gender i just wish i had a penis,NOT

i cant imagine how trans people feel and i cant imagine how one notices that you are trans because i am not but i always liked football and the colour blue but i am not a boy,NOT
the survey about the amount of work men do in households only had a sample size of two households way way too small to have statistical significance,NOT
all i can wonder iswtf is next ,NOT
trisha is already falling off the wagon,NOT
so so so so proud of you i am vegetarian going vegan soon but i know a good amount about veganism i suggest that most of your diet should be whole plant foods aka vegetables fruits but you can definitely eat pasta vegan pizza tofu rice grains and if you crave meat try fake meat like gardein however dont over load on it its a once in a while thing remember eat the whole plant foods until youre satisfied and remember to carb the fuck up love ya girlie i know i will probably get some feedback by other vegans about my recommendations so go right ahead vegans ,NOT
k is  less than k,NOT
freaks the shouldnt allow them to run as girls,ABU
trisha is nothing more than a troll who is dying to stay relevant any way she can shes made such a mockery of every part of the lgbt community i dont even think shes an ally she needs to seek professional mental help and its not for dysphoria she loves her vagina its a shame its bigger than her brain,ABU
im so happy that shes finally giving it a try freelee this just shows again that youre not some bully but someone who really influences people i mean with trisha i never thought id see the day in the best way keep doing what youre doing love you  xx,NOT
freelee is a bitch,ABU
went vegan in february  never going back  my mexican family eats me alive specialty during the holidays those tamales i am bringing are going to be vegan and they wont even notice ,NOT
ive been vegan for a few months now never felt more clear minded and great dont beat your self up if you mess up cause it happens you can have all different foods mexican chinese ect but just sub out the protein for more veggies or beans,NOT
lmao i cant with this chick shes such a joke typical trisha antics,NOT
oh honey how are you trans if u idntify with ur birth gender aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh,NOT
lmao to the people asking why not just hire women have you been watching the video at all if women make less money on average because of kids or other availability issues which is what this suggests then you would need to hire more women than you would have men and women combined just to get all the necessary work done this video suggests that women who can commit as much time as men will make just about as much really if you can split up the parenting load perfectly equally with your spouse and you two have worked the same job for the same amount of time this evidence suggests the wage gap between you two will close,NOT
women have come along way in sports i think this is really unfair i remember back in high school girls use to avoid pe because the guys would be so inappropriate and insensitive many girls did not get into sports because of that reason and now we have a lot of strong female athletes you want to ruin it by throwing men in there sorry like drake im upset,ABU
trisha you do not need to go vegan just stop eating so much heavy processed food and eat a wide variety of fresh organic food eat clean drink a lot of purified or spring water stay active rest treat your body well focus on health you can eat a high plant based diet and small amounts of organic pastureraised meat eggs and wild fish but if you insist on doing a vegan diet you need to make sure you get enough protein eat a wide variety of food get your bloodwork done and consider taking a high quality multivitamin there are great vegan foods and also lots of junk food stick to mostly unprocessed food organic tofu and tempeh brown rice quinoa steel cut oats leafy greens fruits beans sea vegetables like nori sweet potatoes avocado etc etc etc eat wellrounded meals and check out vegan youtubers who eat balanced diets not diets that exclude a lot of different foods like raw vegans there are also good vegan protein powders like sunwarrior and vegan meal replacement shakes like amazing meal which you can mix with vegan milks like almond milk and a little bit of natural sweetener like stevia coconut nectar pure maple syrup or brown rice syrup it would probably be best to find a dietitian or a nutritionist who has experience with veganism who can show you to do it the right way,NOT
yes thank you for this as an activist i sometimes get really down this just shows that last year i had a good feeling about  and here this video just shows that exactly the amazing progress and change and it will keep getting better and better ripple effect lets go guys go vegan for your health the animals the planet and much more ,NOT
wait a second guys its fair because their cocks weigh them down making it more difficult to run as fast figure each of the these girls are packing lb of dick and balls minimum  that should be a disadvantage if you dont realize this is sarcasm it is in no universe should these men be running with girls,ABU
you look like you lost a lot of weight youve slimed down,NOT

i think the modern countries have pretty much overcome the whole gender bias thing the only industry i see that is extremely sexist is movie industry there are a lot of things that dont comply with our modern values but are prevalent in the movie industry  yet these are one ofthe most influential people on earth,NOT
i never want to watch this video or hear this girls voice ever again i literally had to quit eating my food,NOT
oml ppl here are triggered typing up whole freaking paragraphssmh this is youtube lol,NOT
if this is acceptable then i can see males faking to be transgender in order to get scholarships its just a matter of time imagine michael stratham faking to be trans and competing in womens football,NOT
im so happy for you trish i suggest snacking on fruit but for actual meals rice pasta and meat substitutes are the best especially if youre not experienced with cooking vegan meals for eating out i recommend sticking to mexican middle eastern and italian because they will always have vegan options ,NOT
poduction quality is brilliant you guys did a fantastic job this year bring on ,NOT
so if you want to make more money dont have kids problem solved,NOT
the best part about this is a female is narrating this this channel is my hero,NOT
trisha you look gorgeous,NOT
no mention of divorce outcomes yeah lets just ignore that obvious elephant in the room,NOT
trish i really hope youre not trolling if youre not im so proud of you this is the best decision youll ever make my suggestions for protein beans lentils tofu soy protein powder and faux meat products dont be afraid of those there are lots more but those are the main ones i eat gardein meat products are always delicious most realistic taste and texture in my opinion makes it easier to transition my main advice make sure youre getting enough calories eat until youre full you can literally never eat enough fruits and vegetables also vegan junk food is a thing enjoy it but dont make it a staple in your diet  good luck,NOT
yess blaire ive been dming you to react to her hahahaha,NOT
i truly have been wanting to attempt veganism as well when im hungry im not even thinking about what im eating or how many calories it is i hope to join you on this journey please post the process if you can i can easily purchase a book i suppose but i feel that it will be motivating to see your progress too good luck,NOT
they make it seem like that is all there is to the wage gap though what they said s true some women do suffer from pure discrimination when it comes to how they are paid,NOT
this is interesting however the reason why women make different choices on career and pay is because our society constantly influences women on the idea that they arent worth as much as men and that they cannot amount to that by that regard if i was raised with alot of influences that my gender is subordinate to another would greatly affect my choices for my career and my actions to ask for higher pay honestly your channel is no better than the young turks or breitbart,NOT
go vegan yes lets change the world and give the animals a damn break already,NOT

when i went vegan i went into it fully unprepared d i dont know how i survived and that was  years ago when vegan food wasnt as available as it is today im from europe id suggest you to buy a lot of staples dont try to go  pureclean and healthy because you will feel like a failure if you slip up i know i do so i buy myself a lot of healthy staples unprocessed food but now and then i buy some prepared vegan spreads bread veggie burgers etc so pasta in all forms  whole wheat white from different cereals beans lentils canned mixed frozen veggies buckwheat mushrooms and a looot of fruit dry fruit is good too when you have cravings for something dates popcorn if you have a machine you can air pop it potatoes sweet potatoes brown rice basmati rice white rice black rice wild rice red rice oats some type of plant milk try them out mixed nuts seeds to sprinkle on your salad soo lettuce of some kind its nice to eat salad once in a while while i dont suggest eating oil its good to have it in the beginning cold pressed coconut oil is perfection when combining with tomato sauce d virgin olive oil isnt bas as well but i wouldnt recommend heating it if you have a farmers market buy fruit in bulk because if you dont have ripe fruit around you wont desire eating it whenever you feel like eating something just google vegan  and i think there exist a vegan version of anything oh and the best and healthiest icecream out there is banana ice cream or nicecream  the best thing ever that is a must if you feel lost then try a vegan online challenge you have a lot of pages that you can sign up to and they send you tips on how to start where to start what to eat where to buy etc good luck,NOT
what people always ignore about this same wage gap statistics is that it also shows asian americans make more that caucasians,NOT

okay you need to stop because there are actually people who watch you that are transgender nonbinary and genderfluid you should educate yourself by getting friends that have gone throught the bs that family members that dont accept them people lose their lives every day because of this educate before talking about this crap,NOT
f your facts we have feelings murica heck yeah,NOT
im soo happy for you  do not only eat fruits and vegetables there are many many other options pastas beans lentils etc hope you stick to it,NOT
i did like this but i would also add that most mothers naturally have a strong bound with their children witch will lead most women to take more time off of work instead of the man that normally doesnt have a strong of a bound as the mother dose this normally stems from welli women gives birth and carrys the child for  months some women breast feed witch create a vary strong bound a bound that a father cant grow with his child and it can even take a new father a few weeks to even a few months to really feel like a father it just takes men more time its just nature theres a reason why people say women should stay home with the kids and men should go out this tradition has been around sense forever the mothers stayed home kept the kids happy and safe while the father went out and got food times have changed  so women should have choice to work or not to ,NOT
did anyone consider the causality is the other way around jobs with more women get paid less just because the majority are women that would be sexist and when you honestly consider it you realize its true,NOT
i love trish but no i dont understand ,NOT
lol these transwomen beating these females asses in the ufc,ABU
thank you ive lived as an ethical vegan for coming up on  years now my only regret is not living vegan my whole life what the world needs is a real radical internal shift in awareness living as a conscious being with a deep reverence for all life its quite sad how conditioned humans are unaware of how to think for themselves and question everything thankfully there are many who are waking up it is so inspiring to see these vegan films educating the masses the real change begins with all of us looking within and being the change much love to you all a vegan world is rising ,NOT
go to chipotle get a burrito or burrito bowl with rice and beans and some roasted veggies and guac and salsa eat the stuff that makes you feel good veganism for the win,NOT

omg trisha thats incredible i am so so so proud of you  after those two weeks you are going to feel so good dont believe anyone who says veganism is restrictive and expensive the cheapest foods beans and rice are vegan and it is not restrictive in the least if you do it right you can do it,NOT
so nowwe have proof men are smarter and make more hahaha women have children so thats  the rest is just because women dont do the same job,ABU
whats this an internet gossip outlet looking at actual research i almost fell off my chair,NOT
i just shared this with my  followers on twitter   we got this guys more and more people are waking up to compassion for mother earth and the animals everyday  ,NOT
a lack of action does not imply a negative action i think the biggest reason people think of the wage gap has some patriarchal influence is their firm belief that everything is a zero sum game they are unable to see that free trade and laws protecting the individual can help both parties without hurting a third party a third party is only hurt in the fact that a transaction may have not been completed individuals should have every right to pay for whatever they want when both parties benefit and nobody loses especially when purchasing or selling labor,NOT
where can i sign this petition,NOT
the best thing about this video are the comments,NOT
the whole transgender community has called to me im not trans but raise your hand if you were calling out to her,NOT
i love the trans community gee thanks cause now this video makes us look bad ,NOT
am i the only one who actually understand what trisha is saying here she said she is starting tomorrow like theres no discussion to be had doesnt matter if she had nonvegan pizza today shes starting tomorrow doesnt matter if this is infact three weeks old shes starting tomorrow the date it was recorded doesnt matter she said tomorrow which applies strictly to the date this video was uploaded,NOT
i would have loved if the video also included some information about mitigating factors like the fact that women while earning less money on average are the majority money spenders and also gender pension gaps men paying more into it while women are the primary beneficiaries and other such mitigating factors which render the gender wage gap meaningless and might actually flip things considerably towards men being the disadvantaged ones in the whole picture society is much more complicated than single data points,ABU
are you stupid or just fucking dumb,ABU
lol gay people and trans people spend to much of there life worrying about sex there body and partners the only people that can make a min vid talking nonsense about nothing,ABU
gardein chicken tenders i live off of them theyre so good with ketchup ,NOT

for everyone saying  eat pasta bread and rice omg nooo do not eat rice bread or pasta it has so many carbs and add pn pounds very quickly  secondly trish is you want soda then drink diet soda  it has no calories or sugar and doctors and nutritious doctors suggest people on diets to drink diet soda if they are craving soda,NOT
yeah i can explain this pretty simply actually ive seen one of her vids where she says that shes been diagnosed at borderline i am borderline also let me just say that this is her very obviously going off the rails for whatever reasons she has bpd is something that requires a life of upkeep its on the narcissistic spectrum she obviously hasnt been able to take care of herself appropriately and is now giving in to one of the symptoms which is basically that you feel like your core identity is completely malleable its an identity crisis on steroids and shes trying to get back in touch with herself but shes going in the opposite direction to where she should be gigi probably got an earful from trish and likely isnt so sure about it but wants to support her friend trish was talking a lot about her ex if a borderline person is coming out of a good ol dumping thats when the abandonment issues can kick in this might be what that looks like for her questioning her identity because it wasnt good enough for someone and rebounding into a marriage,NOT
oh boy but have you seen the most recent trish video ,NOT
im happy for her,NOT
if we actually gave her dysphoria she wouldnt last a day,NOT
regarding your weight you may notice some fluctuations in your weight because your metabolism will be changing  weeks is a relatively short amount of time so i would encourage you to keep being vegan even after your music video to see how it affects your body also regarding food eat as many fruits and veggies as you want and if you are feeling hungry make sure to eat more potatoes and beans nuts are also a very good source of protein if youre worried about being protein deficient the worst thing you can do on a vegan lifestyle is starve yourself so just make sure that you are always full from healthy food good luck,NOT
can boys dress up as girls and run on the girls track team are we being serious,NOT

i conceide this point however i will also say that i would rather make slightly less living a life i want to live with the profession major and schedule i am happiest and most able to work than chase dollars my entire life,NOT

congrats on going vegan you will feel awesome there are so many food choices besides fruits  thai restaurants can do most dishes my current favorite it generals tofu  if you like spicy also there are lots of wonderful mexican dishes being new vegan you wont miss the meat in these dishes but i do want to tell you with freelee latest drama you dont want to get drawn into having other channels taken down falsely is not something anyone supports,NOT
freelee gurl make a video about this ,NOT
liberals are nothing but shit eaters  seriously they literally eat shit john mcafee ran for president in  for the libertarians he would hire local woman to shit in his mouth when he was living in belize,NOT
this video explains it so good gender wage gap has nothing to do with sexism racism fatshaming or whatever idiotic stuff modern feminist whales come up with,NOT
say sike rn,NOT
its great that some people on the left are finally putting this myth to rest however im confused why they still have an issue with the wage gap now that theyve acknowledged its not sexism i dont understand why the difference in money matters if everyone is making their own choices to pursue their own goals,NOT
wow before u were roasting her for being fat and a meat eater and now all of a sudden youre so nice to her bitch,ABU
sucessful worthwhile men want women who can take care of children women who dont want to take care of kids should not expect to get married by sucessful men,NOT
and also this company called gardein is very delicious and it is vegan,NOT
penisits a boy,ABU
actually they do take into account occupation education and position another part of the wage gap is that men are more likely to get bonuses than women who work the same hours and are more likely to get promoted if a women tries to discussnegotiate a higher salary then she is needy if a man does the same hes a leader,NOT
freelee said you will gain weight if you go vegan carb diet in the beginning but if you keep doing it you will find your ideal weightbody shape find delicious vegan food that has tons of good carbs and bit of protein and enjoy dont worry about putting on weight through eating good food that weight you will lose without you even trying,NOT
you are serving some nicole scherzinger buttons music video vibes in that hood girl love it ,NOT
my new hero she has put common sence,NOT
freelee oh my god,NOT
very well done on turning this one around i never thought i would see this happen,NOT
on her snapchat story she was eating chicken and waffles ,NOT
wait what  did blair say something about that she transitioned in the past because if so i dont believe it  this would be the first trans woman ever where i thought she was born a girlwtf can somebody tell me,NOT
didnt she make a song that she loves jesus,NOT
i thought that this would debunk the wage gap as what it really is being an earnings gap the earnings gap states that overall women make less than men with roughly  cents to a dollar being the figure that they come up with this is statistically true since on average most studies on the subject have shown that men more often ask for raises apply for the highest paying jobs ie stem tend to go into overtime more often and that men arent biologically capable of having children as such men tend to work longer hours and with the same pay earn more women on the other hand have all of these obstacles to overcome if they are to work for the same time and earn as much the icing on the cake is that the pay gap has been made illegal therefore all companies who do this are to go to federal prison as such there wouldnt be a pay gap anywhere in the united states might i suggest you research what you hear before making a video,NOT
anybody who thinks that women earning less than men is a problem are somewhat wrong if a women wants to have a child and take care of that child then there is no need to try to make more women work i agree that it is an issue that jobs arent flexible enough for women who take care of children but in the en it makes no sense to change how the entire world works because some people find it hard to do well in work and take care of a child also if you think about it businesses pay the same amount of money to the same amount of staff so having less women working means there are more men working or other women working who could then support the women who have children money is not being lost from families if women work less,NOT
yall know shes just a troll right shut up,NOT
businesses dont hire only women simce they bitch and moan because of periods and need to take months off for giving birth cuz theyre all whores,ABU
saying there is no wage gap is still a jump from saying it isnt calculated properly,NOT
trish you need to watch jess beautician on youtube she had vegan june and posted what she ate everyday and it all looked soooo delicious ive watched it and im not even veganput me up so she can see this comment lol,NOT
damn tryna get attention dont even know wtf she says cause the things she say dont make sense at all ,NOT
i hope to god they never play in womens beach volleyball that would really fuck up my favorite sport,NOT
there is nothing wrong with traditional gender roles where the husband is responsible for providing and the wife is responsible for caring millennia of history and simple biology tells us that is a strong and efficient default family structure that has kept our species alive this long if thats what a couple wants that shouldnt be a topic for a feminists protest sign just because raising children doesnt get you a paycheck money is not the most important thing in the world even though many people think so on the flip side i do also believe that if both husband and wife want to break from traditionbiology and are both providing then both husband and wife should be caring as well its all about a balance and the  on each side is not what its all about its about a happy and functioning home with what the people inside that home consider an egalitarian division of responsibilities regardless of a wage gap people would do well to establish this before deciding to marry andor have kids so they dont just let life happen to them and become unhappy in their home and channel their discontent into an internal hatred of whatever system or movement they think is keeping them down smart choices planning your life and personal responsibility will do wonders,NOT
she needs help not joking she is very very ill,NOT
im vegan i get it but i really want to knock you off your moral high ground,NOT
just sent this video to a feminist i was blocked right away xd,NOT
thank you for covering this trisha video i felt very confused by what she was trying to say every sentence was either a contradiction or assumptions,NOT

shes obviously very confused i know jason is thanking god he dodged a bullet,NOT
i am in track and cross country and dont think that them being transgender should matter the sport is about running it doesnt have to be that serious let them be youll live,NOT
trisha is wearing the exact same outfit same hair makeup and nails in this video that she was wearing in her june favorites video posted on june   obvious troll,NOT
im only acquainted with the statistics in sweden where the unexplained wage gap is  i think the last point of this video where men in average work longer hours in full time jobs is a factor that should be looked at more according to last years report by scb men work an average of  minutes more per week,NOT
i love this as a fan of both you and freelee i love that you are trying out a vegan diet fruit is great for breakfast for other meals try rice potatoes  pasta all vegan staples mix with veggies beans etc and you are good to go oatmeal is also a great breakfast staple,NOT
in addition to making more flexible hours we should try to create a society where women and men are expected to take equal roles in child caring,NOT
where freelee at,NOT
james i like straight man trisha i like gay man,NOT
she is not gonna last,NOT
clearly a marketing stunt,NOT
if women make less money than men does that mean you get paid less than your male counterparts well if you say you dont get paid differently shouldnt you have said most women,NOT
you had me and lost me why should we fix it its caused by the choices people make in their private lives and we have no business there,NOT
go to whole foods they have a lot of vegan meat and dairy products ,NOT
i honestly prefer black trans gay boys with both parents sticking together than a thug with only a mother always remember chicago shout out to obama,NOT
how u gonna ask a dude if its fair that they compete against girlsthey already mentally touched lol,NOT
you forgot about the wage gap between bunnies and humans,NOT
the only thing people miss about the wage gap is the fact that it doesnt exist,NOT
trisha fyi the only reason freelee is scary skinny is because she has an eating disorder after she eats large quantities of food in restaurants she goes home and throws it up bulimia so please dont aspire to her diet for the reason of obtaining her body there are several signs on her body that give it away you can tell she is malnourished her muscles are shrinking in her arms and other places also if you eat a lot of carbs potato chips pasta etc you will gain weight but then again youre used to eating a lot of highcalorie food so just keep an eye on it with your scale at home good luck,NOT
dont pack in sugary fruits try more hearty foods to fill you up like quinoa vegetables and grains,NOT
why have we not shifted our focus after all these decades considreing what has happened women have become less happy and we have too few children to sustain ourselves we need to widen the wage gap not close it we need more kids more mothers tending to their children family is more important than wasting away in a cubicle more important for women and more important for our society overall a fairly respectable video but as is standard with vox the presentation seemingly made for  year olds was revolting as always,ABU
im so proud of you thats amazing that you are open minded and trying this eat lots of carbs and listen to your body if your body says you are hungry go eat dont restrict your calories you can eat as much as you want i have lost lots of weight and have such clear skin since going vegan its amazing my go to snack is hummus and broccoli mmmmm also eat as much fruit and veggies as you want girl i eat  bananas a day a bag of cherries a bag of carrots and lots of other veggies in one day,NOT

some fucking freak of nature should be jailed,ABU
the gender wage gap is obviously a myth i mean how the hell would companies get away with paying men more for the same work which by the fact is illegal to do and why do i never see any of my most assertive female colleagues at my job complain about it i know a girl at my workplace who is very friendly and all of that but she would never accept to be discriminated like that and would make a very big deal out of it all the time if it actually happened but she seems to love being there and has a great time and she has worked there for at least  years,NOT
trust is so small now her waist looks good,NOT
wait so you are telling me the world is unfair that men and women have somewhat different child rearing roles and that might have an outcome on wages you dont say hey while we are fixing the wage gap maybe we can fix the homeless gap incarceration gap suicide gap draft gap custody gap work related death gap homicide victim gap,NOT
them niggas is weird om,ABU
theyre only doing it coz theyre crap doing it as a male,ABU
 out of  people are feminists,NOT
 people dislike the truth,NOT
the hollywood wage gap is touted as being the most exemplary but every actress whos complained about earning less has always been on set for less time and wasnt a star role or a crowd draw their arguments dont hold water at all and when you point it out all they can say is that youre a sexist,NOT
i loved how right after the covering up pimples comment i get an ad for skin care also the this is vodka by the way im seeing new merchid buy that shirt love it love you blair ,NOT
i think its funny how trisha paytas being attracted to gay men doesnt have people calling her a predator and a rapist but james charles being attracted to straight men did,NOT

wow this is crazy and such a disrespect to womens sports,ABU
trish check out video response of that vegan couple they give you some good tips  by the way so proud of you good luck ,NOT
in every sector in which i have worked women have earned as much as me  because pay has been based on position and any difference has been based on experience merit increases and education my girlfriend and i earned exactly the same amount when we did the same job when i worked in health care there were  women for each man  and those women earned more than me because they were nurses and i was a technician at the time my exwife worked for an energy company and earned literally  more than me,NOT
you cant eat as much as you want on a vegan diet dont listen to freelee thats nuts if you eat too too many calories from any food even fruits and vegetables you will gain weight not all vegan foods are low in calories either,NOT
so mangoes and bananas are filling so those are good,NOT
can i get the links to external sources,NOT
this nigga got a deeper voice than me,ABU
i feel like she just has a borderline dissociative disorder where shes kinda created a male alter but still has somewhat of a grip on her female original identity sense of reality,NOT
ive been vegan for about  to  weeks and tbh its not that hard their are alternative for everythingggg  the only thing is lately my bones have been feeling like weak so my aunt bought me some natural supplements for it other than that ive been fine  ,NOT
there is a wage gap if we tell you there is a wage gap sincerely the progressive liberal commie democrats,NOT
so men and women earn the same just that men work more time thus earn more,NOT

vegan from texas,NOT
ill often wonder if this chick trisha is just a really good actress and thinks of ways to troll youtube and i think that this is not the issue to be trolling about,NOT
disclaimer not trying to start a fight so basically the wage gap is caused by women them selves for their lifestyle so in essence its not a problem that we are facing but a scheduling inconvenience,NOT
yes trashy fishy,ABU
check out  hot for food  on you tube  all vegan all amazing ,NOT
the argument of personal choices in my humble opinion is just trash she ignores that our personal choices are highly influenced by our experiences for example as a man ive been teached that i can do whatever i want if i try hard enough however i know tons of women who have been discouraged from the first time theyve failed doing something if every time you fail doing something someones tells you not to try again or that you cant do that you are not going to even try making personal choices that involve being surrounded by men that probably are going to feel better than you and are going to make you feel like youre worse than them you have to take in account the social reality in which you live when youre analizing this you cant take for granted that all men and women make their choices in the same situation because society is not the same for men and women,NOT
i hope you are exploring these things with your therapist my son is trans and i have zero judgment of you over this having observed your channel for a while though i would advise you to talk about internalized misogyny with your therapist because i think you have experienced a lot of misogyny and it has harmed you a great deal jason was particularly misogynistic towards you make sure its not that,NOT
i feel like if everyone actually took what trisha said to heart and started called trisha he she wouldnt like it,NOT
check out mommy tang she is a vegan mukbanger you love mukbangs d she is so real and is a mommy and her family is nice to watch its like ur in the home d good luck girl,NOT

 days ago trisha was eating meat at a restaurant,NOT

i went out of my way just to click this ad and thumbs up the video,NOT
 trisha is a walking contradiction,NOT

i saw this as an add at first i never thought i would see the day good on them for getting this important info out there,NOT
im no feminist but if you are going to present a proper argument you cant repeatedly twist facts with vague statements why dont businesses hire only woman because when i hire someone for a job there are literally  years worth of discrimination laws that prevent me from making my decision based on gender oh and your reproductive sex is not listed under qualifications  they dont take into account occupation no they only take into account literally all occupations held by botheither genders making it abundantly nonbias position are you reflecting on men holding higher payed positions illustrating a genderbased inequality because it sounds like you did  education people who attend a university will make on average  million dollars more over  years and there are more woman than there are men in college so logically shouldnt education result in woman making more hours per week we literally just heard you mention both parties working fulltime rendering that irrelevant to the statistic ,NOT
its more complex because its inaccurate it doesnt represent reality at all women and men at the same level of experience and seniority in the same fields earn pretty much the same the reason there appears to be a gap is as you said women hold disproportionately more lower paid jobs like child care etc whereas jobs with higher wages like dangerous jobs or jobs in stem fields are predominately male filled men also work for more years on average and take less paternity leave than women take maternity leave mostly because theyre offered a lot less men are also more aggressive in salary negotiations on average and are more likely to ask for a raise,NOT
this was filmed a couple weeks ago and shes been eating meat since then snapchat,NOT

i became vegetarian  months ago and this is my first week as a vegan,NOT
all a means to supporting eugenics,NOT
businesses cant discriminate based on sex though her first point is incorrect but the rest is true,NOT
i did the same thing youre doing about proclaiming it out loud i was stuck in a pescetarian phase for almost a year really struggling to make the commitment to veganism so at work i told everyone i was vegan from that day on and so i was it definitely helps to put it out into the world i lost  pounds in the first four months of going vegan and even though it wasnt my goal to lose weight during this process it is a super bonus the first two weeks is a bit of a struggle but after that as long as you eat well and nourish your body itll be the best decision youve ever made the best advice i can give you is that if you mess up allow yourself to move on a lot of people feel like if they messed up once then its hopeless and they want to stop being vegan you just have to accept the fact that its an entirely new lifestyle you have to get used to and you will accidentally eat things that you wouldnt even think werent vegan just take each moment as a learning experience and enjoy your journey,NOT
i feel like everyone should watch this and then open their mouths to speak,NOT
what i really want to know is how does she do anything with those edward scissor hands,NOT

 cents is how much sjws make,NOT
mostly a good video its a shame the wage gap is often presented as evidence of misogyny if this werent the case i suspect many more people would be on board in finding solutions like more flexible hours or encouraging men to take a more active role in child care and other household duties we also need to make custody more equitable that would make men likely to take a more active role in their childrens lives,NOT
those are men not women fact dont like it boohoo,ABU
ugh whats next trisha coming out as a person of colour,NOT
blaire youre so pretty xx,NOT
should be named idiots of ,ABU

so not true comparing both genders who are working the same job can show you how less is the salary women are getting please stop saying untrue information,NOT

balance lots of fruits veggies nuts seeds beans etc with a generous amount of carbs bread pasta rice etc its important to eat a lot of carbs to keep you satisfied but be careful not to eat more carbs than plants otherwise you might start to gain weight the bulk should always be plants and theres sooo many great easy delicious adorable recipes you can make yourself that you can easily find on the internet and always be sure to keep frozen fruit and vegetables so that you dont have to constantly be buying fresh stuff alll the time,NOT

the wage gap itself completely wrongbecause it doesnt exist the study was conducted by looking at the the wage of women and the average amount they earn a month compared to a man but they didnt take in many factors like bonuseshours offpositions of jobsect also on average women take more time off its a commonly studied statistic used to prove the wage gap wrong men work more hours and take more overtime than women on average women take more time off and the wage gap itself is illegal,NOT
freelees you can eat as much as u want isnt  accuratemaybe it is if you run a k everyday amd do alot of excersise but the foods u can really eat as much as u want of are like carrot sticks minus hummus or like apples or oranges or grapes because those will fill u up fast bc they have a lot of water so u wont really have to eat that much to be full like the whole eating a ton of rice or a whole box of pasta or  pounds of potatos or  mangos is not really healthy unless off course u do a ton of high intensity excersise,NOT
okay but think about ur future partner if you wanna date a straight guy and they get confused about ur gender and you tell them that then theyll get very confused and it might not work out,NOT
i dont under why all the hate for this video if you have nothing nice to say dont say anything at all this is her life can she live,NOT

yas queen im so happy your trying vegan i made the change myself and its been amazing thing you should doknow always look at your nutrition labels for certain products and make sure the ingredients are wholesomenatural eggplant is very good try baking that or roasting it with olive oil nuts seeds berries are great for snaking avocado is very good and instead of dairy milk which isnt nutritional at all by the way i know i was fooled too try using coconut milk or silk vanilla which is soy milk grilling certain fruits such as mango really changes the flavor and grilled watermelon would be perfect look up vegan recipes and hire someone to cook for you if you dont have the time im so happy for you trisha and i hope it goes well for you xoxo ,NOT
she is shitting on trans trenders right,ABU

the pay gap itself comes down to submissiveness if you dont stand up for a better wage you forfeit it and you cant complain men tend to follow the ask and it will be given to you principle more all potential employees men or women are usually offered a standard to low rate its your responsibility as an individual to deny a lowball offerask for a higher offer for if you accept it you share equal guilt to the unfair transaction and have no right to contest what you forfeit and as women tend to forfeit more than men its not the pay gap thats an issues its the inability to ask its not just women many men also fail to ask modern day feminists tend to find excuses and demonize the patriarchy they believe exists to deny their fault note just because you believe something to be true doesnt mean it is and if the patriarchy does exist its because women let it happen,ABU
i promise youre going to love being vegan i love that you take advice from the amazing freelala,NOT

trisha needs help,NOT
great film great job your efforts are greatly appreciated far more than youll ever know keep it up it makes a difference thank you,NOT

first time i see vox slightly nudging the liberal agenda instead of going allout leftist nicely done,NOT
not saying fruits are bad for you just make sure youre not over doing it because they dont always fill you up,NOT
thing is when people hear about that  to  ratio they think that women just straight get paid less if you were to compare a man with the same job and experiences who puts in the same amount of hours as the woman its literally been illegal since  for people to get differing wages like that lol,NOT
if i had penis life would easier so thats why i want one yeah no shit,NOT

a few years from now a word for the thing that she is describing us will come out,NOT
im  and freele inspire me to go vegtarian im not sure about vegan maybe when im  but im happy,NOT
gigis video was well hmm confusing because her end conclusion was how we have to accept trishas assertion and therefore fight against ignorance while she ignored every ignorant thing trisha said like how trisha identified as trans because she wanted male privilege while still identifying with her birth gender that seems like the kind of ignorance hypocrisy that gigi might want to poke at just a bit,NOT
the thing about vegan is that its litterally no animal type food whatsoever like no eggs milk ofcorse chicken hamburgers etc soups n tbings like that and because you arent eating eat you definitely have to find a good source of protein so like lotssss of beans and sometimes vegans will have to take protien supplements but have to watch what they are other than that just making sure you are balanced then you could probably eat as much as you want there are also other diets like the kill catch grow method which is if you dont kill catch or grow it then dont eat it or there is paleo or vegetarian plenty of things to try just really have to find what works for you so that if you want to then you could have it be a life style instead of just a few weeks type of thing ,NOT
very first time i have liked a video of yours very happy for you and proud of you as well take it day by day remember accidents arent the end of the world and try to extend that  weeks to at least  months you need time for your body to get rid of all of that junk you ate before ,NOT

look its not just we look different on the outside were different inside aswell women are designed to carry children men are designed to defend the pregnant women making us faster and stronger just by nature we need to cut the shit and stop alouing these kids to do crap like this those  guys are taking opportunitys away from leget girls i bet there not even fast thats why they wanted to race girls,ABU

all dislikes are from feminists,NOT
oh boy i was waiting for this video ,NOT
theres a lot of pakistani foods that are vegan,NOT
businesses dont hire only women because of discrimination in the old days women were sooooo underpaid but businesses believe men are more capable of doing the work which is why businesses dont hire only women even if there is a gap and they would be cheaper,NOT

wage gap is completely bullshit,NOT
the meat poultry and dairy industries have money and they will fund politicians and climate deniers just like the tobacco industry and the fossil fuels industry they will fight for every last dollar of profit having the science on your side is no longer enough everyone needs to speak up for the future of the planet,NOT

yall really dont realize that shes a troll,NOT
wage gap isent a thing comparing all the avrg of all men and all women what you actualy get is a representation of how strong the difrence between the rich and the poor is lets say  people from group x get to earn  a month another group of  people caled group y earn  aswell yet  of those do not have eny income and  of those have an income of  now you have a group in wich the avrg earning for  people is  and  people in this group wherefor the avrg earning is  now you have an avrg of something around  for group y so yes on avrg group x will earn les then group y but do you realy want to be a part of group y where you have a  chance to end up in poverty and posibly die of starvation at the off chance of  where you might earn more money as you can spend on top of that you have to take into acount that those who are earning  a month probably are giving up the chance of a personal life starting from there s to there s now so lets say you dont want to be a part of this group that gives up everything to earn money now you are just stuck with a  chance to end up in poverty and a  chance to earn a living unlike the  chance to earn a living so you tell me would you rather be a part of group x or y i know what my answer will be i would like to be part of group x and on avrg earn les then group y this btw isent taking into acount chance of having an acident with permanent disability working conditions and all other kinds of bs u whud rather not deal with,NOT

hey trisha im so happy to hear this from you i do want to mention something you wont see drastic change in just  weeks but me personally ive lost  pounds and kept them off in  months and i dont go to the gym and i eat whatever i want vegan until im satisfied i hardly eat vegan junk food so please dont get discouraged if you dont see drastic change in  weeks this lifestyle works you just have to give it time i also have recipe videos if you want some ideas im very proud of you for making the best decision of your life,NOT
i am very much not a feminine person pretty much the only thing i relate to my gender is motherhood but parenthood can take on many forms that arent restricted to gender ive always wanted to be a mom and have a career from home in middle school i wanted to be an author so i could be a mom but man i feel like a woman which is why i didnt understand transpeople until i saw blaire explain the science behind it,NOT
yay so happy for you eat lots of carbs to keep you full and satisfied but also have variety have enough greens fruits and veg rice lentils beans pasta bananas pack in those carbs ,NOT
eat lots of greens if you want to lose weight low fat rice potatoes beans quinoa fruit etc you got this,NOT

you know its kind of unhealthy to not eat meat sometimes and stop shaming people for eating me like,NOT
 i had the same reaction lol,NOT
this was an add on a video i was watching thank youyoutube,NOT
you should try to purchase a vegetarianvegan cookbook there are really good ones out there and make sure you dont only eat fruit because then youll get sick of it so fast and always be hungry you can still eat all your favorite foods just the veggie version black bean or beet burgers are amazing gardein chicken products like their orange chicken or teriyaki chicken are incredible you can even eat like taco bell just order beans instead of beef its way easier than most people think for protein just focus on things like mushrooms chickpeas beans tofu vegetables etc,NOT
i identity as filthy fuqing rich do i get to be what i want,NOT
she already quit,NOT
so funny when men intrude into women space and take it over and dominate it there is outrage when women take over the boy scouts its supported in the name of equality quite the double standard we have here in this shitty time of americas history,ABU
yall realize that trisha is just off her meds l right this isnt real how do yall not see that,ABU
try beans and or lentils for protein,NOT
do a video on your gym routine ,NOT
people hate feelee so much for bullying others but hey it defiantly worked she got trisha to go vegan way to go freelee,ABU
thats so great one day at a time girl  if you like how it feels and you know you want to eventually be a vegan for life know that it can happen and that if you go back and eat some animal product once twice a few times you dont have to throw in the towel some people go vegan overnight and stick to it but many many people dont like me if you really feel how it feels in your heart as well as physically and mentally you can get there never ever thought id go vegan either in the past,NOT
 people cant take raw facts,NOT
made me remember when i struggled with my own gender identity in the past i thought that i mightve been a gay guy in a female body turns out im just very boyish and never really fit with the female must be girly stereotype ,NOT
this is too dumb to even be offensive,NOT
oh man i unfollowed and unsubcribed from this chic a long time ago and ur telling me i cant get away from her him whatever,NOT

so the solution is for women to stop having children,NOT
how much did you pay trisha to make that video you look like a fool now when shes eating chicken every other day,NOT
the gap dusnt egsist,ABU
trisha i wouldnt say im confused well im very confused,NOT
although i agree with most of your commentary about trisha i dont think it was fair to pull in other peoples gender identities and accuse them of doing it for the sole reason of getting clout just because they dont base their entire personhood on their gender identity and make every conversation about it,NOT
 great so its not that women are victims of sexist paying its that theyre just victims of sexist hiring and educational procedures just wonderful clearly this completely debunks sexism in our society,NOT
and that is a badass,NOT
basically men care about money,NOT
freelee i need your help i grew up on animal products living in oklahoma usa always having barbecues going to get fast food never doing anything but playing video games and going to school all of my friends are horrible influences and none of them are vegan much less eat like you do im a vegan but since im only  i cant drain the low income of my single dad family with raw food prices so im gonna have to wait until im  in   years and id love to get to meet you and have you as my health mentor i love your channel and the message you project much love from america,NOT
if theres a wage gap wouldnt everyone hire women,NOT
im surprised vox would actually tell the truth,NOT
what the fuck it is still men competing with women besides they wouldnt allow this in wrestling or boxing,ABU
its a shame that the people who need to hear this the most wont theyd rather perpetuate hate and ignorance than to actually solve anything,NOT
you are awesome and smart,NOT
i wish i hadnt watched this video i,NOT
so in summary for you lazy twats watching the wage gap is formed by the hours and availability of the worker and this generally correlates with gender no feminist bollocks lovely,NOT
to be fair the vast majority of men who studies theology is working to become a catholic priest i can only assume the women want to become nuns i dont know what you get out of the job except a christian job,NOT
its very effective to speak about this issue as a female,NOT
shes always kept her channel and career alive by causing controversy and allowing people to bully and talk shit about her im one minute into the video and i can already tell its nothing new ,ABU
can we stop blurring all the lines so damn much people just need to be proud of who they are,NOT
do it for the animals first and foremost and the next two weeks trust me omg you will feel amazing youre body is going to thank you go vegan for life for the animal yourself and the planet,NOT
i have never loved anything you have said more good luck you are going to do great,NOT

you moving to canada to follow aaron just curious,NOT
you lost a subscriber trisha fuck freelee and her cult,ABU
my pronouns are thee and thou please dont disrespect i identify as god,NOT
it was much better when women could just get a job when they get out of school have a family  retire to look after the kids they didnt have to worry about work because there was more money available to pay their husbands wage now we have these feminazis who want women to work their arse off to prove some psychological point that women can work as well whereas before they could relax  have a nice quiet life now we have this wage gap myth that is splitting people apart whereas before it was you either had a good paying job or a minimum wage job,NOT
been a vegan for over  years and an animal rights activists with vegan life change for almost  years ive been involved in so much and have definitely seen massive growth in veganism and animal rights the world is going vegan we have no other compassionate choice for the planet,NOT
you never take into account what directs the choice of the people women are not sent signals that they can be engineers explorers or have an open world of careers for them i am not trying to sound like some liberal hippy but the it is evident that exposure to certain elements will influence your thought process from a young age women are given easybake ovens and fashion barbies while men are given tool sets and cars while yes you are the one who chooses your career but you are not in control of what products are placed in front of you your whole like that direct you towards who you become therefore there is still oppression with these gender roles also i am sure there is a misconception about females making  to every  and this video does a good job on clearing up some of the math unfortunately i dont know that much about that topic so i wont put in my  cents on where i stand on it maybe that joke was a bit tasteless,NOT
guess what the wage gap exists even between only men but of different age between different parts of the same city among men in different fields etc etc etc,NOT
be a gladiator in  a slave obese many health issues having to fight to the death eating nothing but barley  the game changers,NOT
woman and men have different values,NOT
so if ca goes along with th court are you proudly going to go around topless in public if its legal please please please,NOT
ok they may not be boys but they not girls either so start a trans track team then its fair,ABU
im currently trying to be vegan for a few months now and ive been really successful lately but i also have celiacs disease too so when im on vacation its really hard for me to find vegan and gluten free food ,NOT
 please give data from the last two decades and not half a century ago,NOT
great video that shows that the causes are part of the system and social structure and not just an arbitrary pay gap,NOT
she is a girl that doesnt want that much attention but sometimes she wants attention,NOT
trisha going vegan is amazing dont get me wrong but what about all those leather purses she has and what not,NOT
this is beyond bullshit men should not compete in womens sports and yes you are males you cant just slap on a wig and eyeshadow and call yourself female my femininity is not your damned costume,ABU
fucking cheating losers nothing against trans people just fucking cheaters like these dudes,ABU
she posted a video of herself eating chicken and waffles on her snapchat ,NOT
yaaaayyyyyyyy usa vegan here beanbettys and soyboys unite my favorite part of this years film was the honorable mention of plastic waste we need to be moving toward a zero waste future veganism and zero waste go hand in hand,NOT

you were born a boy deal with it,NOT
my question is why are jobs that women due more  pay less,NOT
i want to go vegan but my parents wont let me and theyll just force me to eat meat they just dont listen too what have to say,NOT
so shes claiming to be a trans man who likes to dress in drag so a woman gender politics is so confusing at least blair helps me feel like im not the only one going crazy looking at some of the batshit going on but being a straight white guy i cant comment on anything anymore or theres calls to burn me at the stake,NOT
fun fact dressing up as troy bolton doesnt make you transgender,NOT
jawanna mann lol,NOT
if you confine your research to married working couples then why should the wage gap even matter at all the household is going to benefit if one party is being paid more regardless of who that party happens to be,NOT
youre goal is to replace a meaningless wage gap by having companies have more flexible hours which is detremintal to buisness,NOT
maybe she actually feels that way that she was describing but transgender is not the term for what she is feeling at all,NOT
maybe youre biand gender fluid,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense gold,NOT

beans are huge in protein,NOT
the wage gap isnt reeeeeeeaaaaaalll,NOT
i think the power part was misinterpreted i think she mean how the world sees it most folk in rl see any female being more straight forward an well that bitch like the girl who doesnt need help she good all on her own type as too much an not feminine an thats what she mean do she feels like because those traits are more normal an accepted in dudes that she feels more like a dude dont get me wrong she sounds kinda crazy but i think she basically saying she more masculine then she believes to be normal for a girl an feels like she might be trans or some umbrella term like i get her cause i be feeling the same way but i know im tomboyish an kinda androgynous so ,NOT
trishhh u should try frozen grapes they are sooooo goood thank me later,NOT
go trisha but please dont eat unlimited calories you will gain weight a lot of people have but you can still eat more than you usually do since a vegan diet is lower in calorie,NOT
nice video but why are you too lazy to just try to pronounce the names slightly correct it seems respectless towards the job you are doing as if youd made a shitty presentation when holding a speech,NOT
do you want to see the left start eating their young just start hiring men who identify as women in stead of actual women and promote more of them competing in sports until actual women are shoved right out of the money o it would be a misogynists wet dream and all brought to you by the left roflmao,ABU
even though i dont agree with you about everything but i love you,NOT
well that didnt last ,NOT
i respect this video much more than others covering the issue which typically makes my blood boil the reason being that instead of making a victimizing video bout how woman are so oppressed she attacks the issue by looking in to why it is that women tend to have lower salaries and its not because employers are paying less just because you are a woman its because most women bear children and mothers tend to their babies you cant be the best at work and have a all the time most people want in their families,NOT
doesnt matter what year it is idiots are still going to believe this myth,NOT
im going to assume you didnt mean to but you definitely just called every human that identifies as theythem schizophrenic,NOT
i was late at seeing that channel u r perfect,NOT
this is like alexandra trusova the figure skater identifying as a man and wiping the floor with the natural born men because she has superior flexibility and her quads are amazing it would be unfair in sports that favour women to allow biological women to compete as men against men as they have the more desired abilities and body shapes this applies to biological men competing in sports that favour masculinity as transgender women it simply isnt fair regardless of what anyone says,NOT
thats awesome you go girl its super easy but rather than doing it temporary why not do it for life you should include beans and rice brown rice and any kind of beans,NOT
modern liberals triggered,NOT
congrats girl  weeks is not enough thpugh try maybe a month to feel the effects also you need so much more food to keep you full i eat pastas for dinner a lot and it keeps me away from the animal products,NOT
please get help,NOT
i believe woman is not only a troll but shes a dimwit im straight as can be and i know that what shes saying doesnt work that way,ABU
i loveeeeee youuuuuu sister keep it up ,NOT
why are the jobs that women prefer undervalued isnt there some amount of sexism at play in at least that aspect,NOT

the other thing about the wage gap is they say that white women make  cents for every mans dollar and then later on they say something about black or latino women making  cents for every dollar is this then suggesting that the wage gap is also racist when was the first time you ever heard a feminist bring this up if blacklatino women are earning less than white women,NOT

freelee isnt a mean person she is a highly passionate person who supports a vegan lifestyle if she was a mean person then she wouldnt make a video talking about how proud she is of trish freelee is just an advocate of a vegan lifestyle and is determined to inform the public about animal cruelty and to that i say you go girl if you dont like freelee then you probably eat meat or do not understand how animal cruelty can really effect people due to how disgusting the industry is keep doing what youre doing girl and im happy that you are supporting trish much love from here in canada,NOT
we will have none of your logic around here only feelings theyre what matter,NOT
measure a womens hours pay per hour and effort into the work then give the male the same job for the same hours and a similar attitude and effort into work thats how a good study could be performed two similar individuals of opposite sex,NOT

she literally has claimed shes black and has been in mental institutions shes delusional,ABU
jelly of your alcohol think imma have some of my own tonight after work,NOT
so women get paid less because they take care of their children and do more housework and work for less hours for the same job than men ok so feminist myth debunked that for the same amount of time worked women get paid less its quality and quantity that matters to make money so money quality of work x quantity of time given hence even if quality of both genders remains same the quantity of time poured by women is less because of her maternal instincts which should not be booed by feminists i respect good mothers who pour in a lot of efforts in their job as well as to their kids men and women are simply just different if we try to make them look equal or make either gender be superior then its wrong proud egalitarian here ,NOT
havent seen any female transgenders boys winning medals in the male races i guess replacing hormones works and makes it fair,ABU
wage gap is  cents on the dollar within the margin of error,NOT
sis this is so ugly just when i thought you couldnt get any worse you have trans friends how could you make a joke of it youre fucked,ABU

blaire you are a breath of fresh air your videos are very interesting intelligent and are very positive for everyone not only the trans community,NOT
can you give me the link to the video farm to fridge,NOT
as a loan officer at bofa so during the course of a day i would ask several people how much money the husband and the wife makes i found in the vast majority of families it is actually the woman with the stable job who makes more money but when they average in the the high wage earner males into it it appears that men make more so for example out of  couples  would have the wife who makes more money they fourth the husband may make more than all of other men and women put together i am guessing that are looking the the numbers in the fourth family the wife is likely to not work at all so they would count her income as zero because her husband makes more money then all of the other people combined they would then say men make more money on the other hand i find liberals lie about statistics and really bend the rules to come up with the result they want to come up with,NOT
trisha i think its so good that you are able to give a vegan lifestyle a try just make sure you eat stuff like rice beans etc not just fruit also i would encourage you to look into more about veganism not necessarily watch slaughterhouse videos but educational video about why people chose to go vegan etc nonetheless i am still proud of you for giving it a try you go girl ps even if you are not serious as some people are suggesting in the comments i think that it is good that you are at least spreading the message a little by making a video addressing veganism love you trisha ,NOT
she has also came out as a chicken nugget,NOT
i love the drag culture and community they are glamorous beautiful artistic unique and very popular its easy to feel jealous of them and wish you could be a drag queenbut that doesnt make you transgender,NOT
wage gender gap was created by the far right,NOT
there is no fuckimg sexism related to this because for the same and hours worked men and women earn the same,NOT
i truly hope trisha doesnt smoke a lit match anywhere near her will make the hydrogen in her head explode,ABU
trader joes does the best mushroom and teriyaki sushi  just saying  tbf you live in the us so im guessing you have a good availability of fruit and veg as well as alternatives as far as milk alternatives go cashew milk is amazing also you can get coconut and soya drinks made from starbucks  so frappichinos are still on the menu  you will need other options other than fruit cooked carbs and veg with a nice source there are plenty of low fat tasty sources in the health food section of the supermarket and as for protein there are plenty of meat alternatives or things like beans and lentils can be added into cooked dishes salads soups ect good luck,NOT
if you are a woman how is the wage gap affecting you if the issue is that women do more unpaid work like taking care of their children because they want to then how does that affect you as an individual if a wife and husband decide that the husband is going to do the unpaid housework and childcare from now on the woman will be earning more than him tldr the woman prefers to do the housework the gap wont affect her if she solves the housework problem with her partner,NOT
us vegans will help you but you need to put down those chicken fingers ok gurl,NOT
oh no trish pls dont fall into the quicksand of the mainstream transitioning to veganism i absolutely love your vlogs because youre being yourself plus size and loving it with a sass cuz u know girl love me some bacon if it turns out that you love being vegan then i support you i will give you a chance but if you start posting motivational videos and vegan recipes i will unsubscribe your ass immediately love you xxxxxx,NOT
if women earned less than men in the same exact job why would anyone hire any men if women really earned  for every  a man earns that would mean companies would spend less on wages if there was an all woman workforce if that was true every job would be taken by women,NOT

i demand vlogs daily for the next two weeking,NOT
tank fuck bitch after eating a whole farm,ABU
if shes not joking she needs therapy,NOT
the video omits history and social context as well as clearly known facts that men by a wide margin outnumber women as chief executives in fortune  companies only  of all ceos in fortune  companies are women why men and women take different jobs is not a matter of choice but social norms history and context feminism understands these social norms to be corrosive to the broader social fabric when any sector of society has to struggle this hard to contribute that society serves its members poorly what can be the value of supporting one already dominating point of view that helps only a few what is the value of the inequality that this video supports,NOT
ok im not even halfway through the video yet and i already know that youre just lost and very very confused which is okay i was confused about being trans at the beginning too so i dont wanna jump to conclusions and just criticize you now i just really think you should do a little more research on the matter maybe talking to some trans people as well and see where it goes and how you feel about all of it you know good luck,NOT
if you ever crave ice cream take some super ripe frozen bananas almond milk and cinnamon and blend it all up in a blender it is so good and it totally knocks out my sweet tooth ,NOT

i had a dream that i had a penisthats a sign i am now going to become a man im transgender,NOT
women choose to make less money than men then women choose to complain about their choices then they choose to argue that it is not their fault that they voluntarily made choices that they understood women that argue that this exists actually just think that men are superior and that women need special treatment,ABU
did she just greet people by saying hey vanilla but hes i think not thats a thumbs down no bueno,NOT
great moment in women sports these girls train and work hard for years just to lose to a guy these girls should boycott all events until this nonsense stops,ABU
i thought you were cool bc of the reality house but my thoughts about you went ,NOT
dont try to reason with feminists theyre already a lost cause,NOT
after  weeks shes gonna go to in and out or taco bell or red lobster or the capital grill,NOT
they are using their gender for an advantage why dont these girls want to play football,NOT
this is an important video there are a lot of emotions and identity politics at play when discussing the wage gap which causes it to become an all or nothing it exists or it doesnt debate if we can all stop breathe and acknowledge exactly what is causing this wage gap then we can find areas where it can be mitigated paternity leave is a good place to improve upon for example,NOT
my biggest tip for losing weight on a vegan diet is to avoid processed foods obviously just cause its vegan doesnt mean its healthy haha although vegan junk food is definitely better for you than non vegan junk food just stick to fruit veg wholegrains nuts seeds and legumes if you wanna lose weight fast limit your fats ,NOT
she literally like a year ago trashed vegans so hard,NOT
cant you just be thankful you make ,NOT
okay so i am not trans however i am pan but from what ive seen so far the trans community doesnt claim her,NOT
i hope your vegan diet goes well  you should try to eat things like kale lentils beans quinoa brown rice etc so you wont starve yourself good luck,NOT
this sounds like shes trying to be trans but shes describing gender fluid which is where ones gender switches on situations or days or whatever,NOT
wtf is happening,NOT
ive never heard so much vocal fry in one video,NOT
the answer is not to put more women in those maledominated positions as chs pointed out that it comes down to personal preference but to either put more money into those femaledominated positions like social work or find a way to make those more profitable no easy task,NOT
you know what people miss about the gender wage gap its nonexistence,NOT
but you just ate a chicken waffle on your snapchat lol,NOT
check out mommytangs channel and hotforfood you can do this,NOT
going vegan isnt a diet its a lifestyle,NOT
i feel like eating a ribeye steak now,NOT

so youre a tomboy it sounds like you dont even know what you want to say or who you are or what to come up with hmmm im offended,ABU
how can there be a gender wage gap if there is  genders,NOT
wonder if ever any feminist will complain about the consumption gap because i can bet women end up wasting much more money then men and those sad oppressed girls dont even get to use their own money on those dresses,NOT
not wanting to get ready full glam everyday doesnt make you any less of a woman,NOT

her eyebrows different sizes,NOT
people keep on saying she prerecorded this and thats why shes not vegan anymore but why the fuck would she still post it then and have people thinking that shes vegan right now thats really doesnt make any type of sense fr if she actually did prerecorded it and post it while she wasnt vegan idk whyshe shouldve just kept the video to herself then if she wasnt vegan when she posted it,NOT
theres a gap but it isnt because women are paid less due to their gender its because they are expected to sacrifice their career for their children because of their gender if more women had the support to work full time and men felt comfortable being the more full on parent i dont mean that dads are lazy or dont care we wouldnt have women complaining about the pay gap and men complaining that the system is against them when it comes to children,NOT
the more i watch your videoes the more i like you in the beginning i thought you were a bully but now i just like what you do and i see that you are trying to change and wanna do good for the world  good that people like you are around,NOT
go trish this is awesome girl your gonna feel so great after not having dairy im so excited to see how great you feel and bomb you will look for this next music video hot for food has a great youtube channel for vegan recipes and honestly to not eat to much just eat when your hungry and stop once your full thats all their is too it just dont overeat love you xoxo i hope you continue veganism after your music video it would make your vlogs so much more exciting to watch ,NOT
 she sounds like she wants to be those non binary or gender fluid people and sounds like shes trolling it would be fine if she actually was a transgender man attracted to men but she still looks female and isnt trying to transition hate that people are giving her attention cause thats all this stunt shes pulling is for regardless if its negative or positive ,NOT
beyond meat and imposible food must worka harder,NOT
great i just happened to watch vegan  this morning ive been a vegan for precisely  days which is how long its been since i watched what the health on netflix these movies can turn people because for so many of us we somehow remained in the dark on these truths so powerful they can be instantly lifechanging once we realize eating animal products is actually bad for us and we dont need to do it then we no longer need to accept consuming animal products no matter what the rationalization in which case we can see it for what it is its a complete paradigm shift because most of us have always believed we needed to consume animal products in which case thats just the way things are turns out we dont live in a dogeatdog universe but a pandaeatbamboo universe,NOT
it doesnt exist end of story,NOT
omg freelee where r u,NOT
i recently went vegan i have never felt better,NOT
im not trans so i felt it wasnt my place to say  but i really dont think shes trans,NOT
accidently a biting satire of a infectious  memetic  gender identity delusions ,NOT
lefty propaganda as always,NOT
its actually really common for people to gain weight when they first go veganvegetarian because their body is used to being deprived of nutrients from calorie deficiency dieting starving yourself and is still storing everything as a fat reserve your body will adjust within a month or so of normal eating sufficient calories carbs and nutrients and plateau at a certain weight then youll start losing it best way to combat the initial weight gain is to drink a lot of water and exercise daily  min of cardio is a good starting goal just mentally prepare that youll gain a bit of weight before youll begin losing it because of your dieting habits  good luck oh and also root chips  leaf cuisine spreads  bomb its healthy probiotic chips and dip and it can be used instead of creamcheese  its vegan and dairy free if you want to substitute soda try kombucha as well ,NOT
both of them are biological mistakes which unfortunately happens they can identify as they please but they are still not women simple as that all they are doing is cheating that is all there is to it ,ABU
im on my third year vegan and really and truly wish that id made the change sooner after over  years vegetarian my conscience would feel so much cleaner if i had i would love to get into a one to one conversation with jack skipper  what a disgusting human being seeing animals as a commodity and nothing else  what arrogance  shows a total lack of humanity the rest of us are starting to see the light and not a moment too soon,ABU
as i commented on another video about this i dont do my hair and make up because im a lazy shithead i guess im trans too sarcasm,NOT
am i the only one here who is fucking confused on what is going on,NOT
or you could just let women be happy and have to jonb they want and family time they want,NOT
 says that my old highschool is just conveniently ignoring this video we at one point spent and entire hour talking about how men are payed more than woman and completely ignored the fact that it is illegal to pay someone more or less based on sex race etc if i could go back with the knowledge i have now i could easily disprove them but sadly at the time i still thought the crazy ones were just feminazis and not the whole feminism movement as a whole,NOT
this prageru people are the same people who told smoking cigarettes are good for health,NOT
you so crazy  love your witty comebacks and goofiness love you,NOT
i like trisha coming out as a centaur,NOT
not gonna lie blaire is so hot love it,NOT

i think this myth is actually starting to dissipate at least in sweden most feminist most are actually quite reasonable over here,NOT
how many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb    none because they think the world revolves around them,NOT

thank you for all the work and logic ,NOT
wow an actual sensible video about the wage gap,NOT
wait wait hold up one year out of school on average women are making  a year and men are making  a year haha im pretty sure most grads arent making more than kyr regardless of gender i wish i was in that average haha,NOT
isnt prager university a c im all for the facts and this video defiantly has some however remember that theyre only giving you evidence that supports their argument its great to be informed but dont narrow your information to only one source,NOT
men are more likely to pick high paying jobs and women are more likely to pick low paying jobs within the statistics provided in the video from that you could say that the higher paying jobs are more masculine and less feminine because of the choices females and males are more likely to make on average representing the different mind sets than the lower paying jobs and that our society tends to benefit masculine qualities over feminine qualities as a whole determined from those statistics also the title there is no gender wage gap is very misleading when the video proceeds to explain why there is a gender wage gap this argument comes across as very counterintuitive one last thing genders occurred in our species long before we formed a currency in which to reward each other for jobs doesnt it seem strange we have worked ourselves into a situation as a species in which occupations that are mostly male dominated are going to get rewarded more than female dominated occupations over the duration of time we have been evolving with these delicate and influential minds problems like these have inevitably been emphasised and expanded from our initial nature and we should probably fix it,NOT
i dont like attention takes out k ad billboard in la gtfo,NOT
scientists say methane is bad for the environment eating lots of plant based food will make you fart more which will create more methanevegans are planet killers think ill stick to meat,NOT

vegan yrs lbs down from a pre diabetic to a non pre diabetic from acid reflux and throwing up every night to not having acid reflux at all went from constipation ibs to pooping  times a day i think i will stay vegan ,NOT
we have reached full circle also her nails scare me,NOT
fuq them that one boi has a whole ass mustache ahahaha society has become one giant ass joke they were probably trash competing against other men so now they are barely the best competing against only women lol,ABU
im not vegan but i try and cut out as much as i can i dont drink milk eat yogurts i have non dairy butter i dont eat beef or pork or anything you can get almond milk which i think is so nice on its own and you can use it for cereal and coffee you can get great vegan alternatives and i always try to substitute when i can,NOT
are we sure this wage gap is true,NOT
i have been vegan for about  months the reason for me doing this is because i watched a documentary and i was horrified at the time i was already vegetarian and i wasnt aware of just what they do for dairy or on dairy farms in general i feel a lot cleaner and have lost a bit of weight thats not why i made this choice at all just a side notebonus  first of trish i am very happy to hear that you are going to make the jump and try to eat a vegan diet  my advice to you being a new vegan would be dont give up you can do it theres tons of delicious vegan meals of course if you get stumped you can look up some recipes on peta and on pinterest pinterest has been my best friend through this thank you for shining some light on this subject and choosing to make an effort rather than ignore the issue ,NOT
as a feminist i apologize for the sjws and radfems who turn a blind eye to the truth in favour of some skewered womyn are opreesed bullshit,NOT
you two men are horrible for doing this just saying go challenge other men and just stay dressed up as women problem solved,ABU
also if your breaking out its because of sugar so dairy with high carbs any kind that is low fat will break you out and its even worse if its dairy that is low fat mixed with sugar stay away from sugar and low fat dairy and especially the combination if you dont want to break out i got rid of my acne like this,NOT
im a vegetarian and i eat from this brand morning star and they have really good black bean burgers and chicken sandwiches  not real chicken obviously i dont know if its the same think but you should look into it but yeah sorry if this doesnt help sorry,NOT
stress makes me break out like crazy i went vegetarian minus the main dairy product like milk cheese eggs etc and i still breakout when i stress out before exams dont rely on veganism to cure all of your problems and dont expect to see results straight away youre not going to see results in  weeks i would say after two months of me being veggie by body actually got use to it and i went from  stone to  and a half i actually gained a lot of weight in the first month due to the changes in my diet by body wasnt use to,NOT
thank you trish i love you please be a part of this change i believe in you,NOT

i love that youre trying out veganism  i do think you should have bought more fruit and fruit with more calories but this is fantastic i highly recommend eating lots of rice potatoes and pasta because those are very high calorie high carb foods and theyre so yummy too,NOT
how can compare transgender with the girls threy are born a aman sorry for my english and back you if you dont mind,NOT

i thought this was supposed to be about the female gap,NOT
im sorry but fk you,ABU
simple if someone does a job as well as someone else they get paid the same doesnt need to involve race gender background or religion just how well the job gets done,NOT
moving just a little off topic the worst paying jobs you mentioned should be higher paying they are incredibly important jobs especially teaching and we should be trying to make pay fair for all of them its not a sexist issue but it would mean women will start to earn a bit more,NOT
if it were a male explaining this it would have a lot more dislikes,NOT
if u disliked ur a fat slag and u think u know everything when u dont,ABU
the only real way you will make a huge movement is if you will create a catchy more lighted more positive not lemme scare you type of documentary but more of a fun and its easy to change the world and easier to achieve than you think attitude show real stories of real people talking about their transition to vegan life their daily eating  food prep habits cravings snacks etc you name it recommend good vegan foods available in shops to the population just make a more visual documentary which will make people think its cool and actually make them want to give it a try its all about marketing yall,NOT
start wiht  weeks but continue because it can take months to notice a life changing high feeling i feels amazing u dont even need drugs,NOT
trisha  you are making this for the wrong reasons  vanity next time you hate yourself youre gonna stuff yourself with mac and cheese and salami you need to realize how these greasy salami bites come on top of your pizza and ditch this dead fresh suffering blood and injustice forever dont watch these videos  yeah everybody dont go to concentration camps and lets continue killing jews cause its hard to watch,ABU

i appreciate that this video acknowledges that the wage gap is not caused by discrimination however it still maintains that women choosing lower paying jobs on average is a problem since when has making a choice that impact nobody but yourself been a bad thing,NOT
god damn it i cant believe my history teacher in high school fooled me into believing this if it simply compares median incomes then its a joke of a comparison women need to realize that men are still slightly better than them overall and worry about their individual selves women were never meant to outclass men their primary focus should be to develop the skills and habits that they can pass onto their children to offset their lower income,ABU
feminist counter argument women dont get into those positions because the patriarchy women cant do anything for themselves a reason why feminism hurts women more,NOT

the problem with the wage gap and other problems with equality is how people look at statistics im not sure what its up to now but the figure is around  that is that women on average across a lifetime earn about  of what a man earns on average across a lifetime when i see just that statistic i look at it and think thats an interesting statistic i wonder why that happens but the wage warriors and equality of outcome warriors look at it and think thats unequal thats a problem what are the horrible reasons for this occurring probably sexism i am going to prove its sexism,NOT

a plant based future is our only future ,NOT
vegan the sixth sense has finally been unveiled,NOT
we have disappointed god and all man kind,NOT
all i got from this video is the reality that the wage gap is a myth in the respect of people paying men more on purpose in reality women choose less paying jobs and easier hours and take more parental roles,NOT
i think shes being serious because she just seems like someone who would be that dumb and stupid to say something like that she seems really unstable and that this is either a coping mechanism or cry for attention or shes actually that confused either way if she is being serious i get that she might not always want to have to put the effort out to be the most beautiful woman ever but just because she doesnt like that does not make her trans lmao she need some milk,ABU
the  cent for every dollar a man makes has been debunked for decades women choose to go into lower paying fields than men when you look at the top  paying fields of study at university men dominate  out of  there are a majority of women in only  field of study and thats pharmacology  female  malebarely a majority when you look at the bottom  paying fields women dominate  out of  fields psychology sociology early childhood education etc guess what folks a petroleum engineer makes more than a kindergarten teach or a social worker this video also glosses over evolutionary differences between men and women and how we evolved the gap exists in business more because men are more aggressive not only are they more likely to ask for a raise but they are also more likely to push hard for sales women use different tactics often looks and sexuality in business specifically sales ill likely be called sexist for pointing out these facts but feel free to research them yourselves and ask any questions there is a pay gap between men and women for doing the same job but its about  men also work an average of  hours more per week so women work fewer hours and tend to spend more time with their kids single women age  who dont have kids earn  more than their male counterparts why is this fact never discussed the truth is that men and women go into different fields mainly because of evolutionary biology its why african americans are only  of the population but are  of the nba is it racist to say that on average a black man can jump higher and run faster than a white or asian man or is this accepted because it is not a negative either way its a fact that cannot be disputed by science,ABU
is someone willing to talk to me about why it is hard for some ladies to understand that there will be the wage gap for men tend to take risks and the jobs that go along with the risks are rewarded with a higher pay if majority of women do the jobs that are secretarial oriented they shouldnt expect to be paid more or equal to the man climbing a ft tree or digging out sewers and of course you forget the electricians who have to work themselves through the wires and some get electrocuted therefore women and men can not make the same because men tend to go for the jobs which are high end risky and jobs that involve a lot of mental capacity put into them and men do very good at them thats my take on the issue,NOT
their voices are stronger than mine and im a real male  these are some strong niggas,ABU
welp looks like we need more abortions a feminist would say,NOT
na but feminists and colleges students all over america think th wage gap is real this factually correct information must be fabricated theres no way th feminists could be wrong ,NOT
if the argument is that women spend more time taking care of children the solution would not be to make flexible hours for them its to let men take paternal leave if you give them flexible hours it only incentivizes businesses to pay them less,NOT

fruit smoothies using almond milk instead of milk  tastes amazing and so filling ,NOT
i make  dollars a year while a adult makes   child wage gap,NOT
it is likely there is some gender earnings gap due to discrimination in the  or so we cant yet explain but it is completely irresponsible to say we cant explain all of the pay gap therefore discrimination that is just bad logic this is a common tactic in politics to jump to conclusions in defense of personal agenda,NOT

freelee just started watching your videos and am in love with you and i actually am going to try a vegan diet but i have a question for you and other vegans below if you can help me i just watched joeys video where he talked about milk and you said how people should cut that out of your diet but i know milk is good for you and makes bones strong so i dont want to cut it but i am just wondering if i can still drink almond milk or dairy free milk because i already am lactose intolerance so just wondering if i should still cut that thanks so much xoxo,NOT

bet she wont last though ,NOT
i would argue that modern feminism and equality has made it harder for women,NOT
you see the wage gap comes up as a really cool statistic for feminists the fact is women earn about the same in the same jobs with the same hours as their male counterparts why did i say about the same because men are much more likely to ask for a raise there is nothing keeping you from earning the same as the men its simply you and science  but that doesnt really change things,NOT
trish remember you can buy vegan cook books and online recipes tofu is a great alternative for meat and talk to a doctor about protein deficiency because you need to make sure you do this the right way or else youll fall back im not vegan im just educated,NOT
jason really dodged a bullet,NOT
there is no question about it they do have an unfair advantage the only question is why are they allowed to compete against girls,NOT

vox whats wrong with you it wasnt ultra liberal,NOT
this film is has never been more relevant than right now,NOT
i understand the backlash from this video i understand how misinformed most of this video is but as a member of the lgbt community i think this is an amazing opportunity to educate and correct her on what she thinks is being transgender i think that unfortunately many people share a lot of the same views that trish does in this video i dont know her motives for making this video or how her views became so inaccurate but the way that we as a community react to moments like thesewith backlash and hate or education and unitywill shape the way the world views our community we need to find more ways to unite and educate rather than bash and cancel just my two cents,NOT
yeah men should take more pregnancy breaks wait no but they should spend more time at home breastfeeding the kids hold on its almost like women are biologically designed as caretakers for children also did you ever consider that the pay gap isnt meant to be closed maybe women will always be less competitive maybe women will always want to have kids maybe women will always prefer jobs like teaching kindergarten while men prefer jobs like particle physics,ABU
jesus created boys and girls satan is really working hard disrespectful too the most high i put a porsche bumper sticker on a dodge took it too the porsche dealer its confirmed that its still a dodge,NOT
when i went vegan for  and a half weeks i literally ate so so much not because i was hungry because my meals were so filling that they lasted me from each meal to the other i just liked snacking on stuff out of boredom yet i still lost  pounds a week and also before i went vegan i had problems with an extreme slow metabolism and i was overweight when i stopped being vegan i struggled so much to get back into the routine of no snacking so that i didnt gain too much weight i gained a couple of pounds but i found becoming vegan so easy it was stopping it which was hard my metabolism is still good from it though also my fave dinner was jacket potato with kidney beans in chilli sauce its chilli con carne in a tin with no beef and salad as a side yum and so so easy and filling  good luck,NOT
shes just trolling,NOT
isnt trisha clearly trolling here though,NOT
gigi we have to believe her blaire im gonna kill myself ,NOT
people also miss that the wage gap doesnt exist,NOT
men are more likely to ask for raises,NOT
the problem with this discussion is that people judge the value of a job based solely on the amount of money it gives anyone who has ever looked for a job knows that money is not the only thing one considers you also look at not only flexibility but also commute time travel requirements workplace environment risk of injury opportunity for advancement and many more what this means is that a woman can make less money than a man at the same job while still getting the same value from it even if there is a gender wage gap that doesnt mean there is a gender jobvalue gap,NOT
orange chicken and cajun chicken littles arechicken lol you just ate there lol,NOT
so wait women are whining because they lost the race wait i thought women and men were equal and women were stronger than men women are superwomen and women can do anything what happened to all the delusional big talk now that these transgender women are crushing the other female athletes and why arent the tradcons complaining about girls being in the boy scouts you gotta love the hypocrisy,NOT

long story short women consistently choose jobs that pay less then blame women for it they are also more likely to take time off less likely to work overtime more likely to leave for pregnancy less likely to act for a raise and less likely to ask for a promotion there are studies on all of this but it doesnt fit the feminist narrative so its ignored,ABU
these meat factories are brainwashing their customers saying meat is healthy just like ciggerete companies saying that smoking is healthy and as pure as water during world war  and being vegan is super easy nowadays awesome movie,NOT

girls athletics will soon be completely destroyed because of this nonsense if you have xy chromosomes everywhere except for half of your sperm you are a male if you have xx chromosomes you are a female period thats science i dont care what hormones you take or what you take to supress other hormones i dont care if you mutilate your body to change your outward appearance i feel tremendous empathy for your confused feelings but your feelings dont change the fact that you are physiologically male males should compete against other males females should compete against other females to do otherwise flies in the face of science and gives a tremendously unfair advantage to boys pretending to be girls maybe its time to add two more categories to student athletics boys who think they are girls and girls who think they are boys then the playing fields are level and no one has an unfair advantage,NOT
im still trying to figure out what this whole  minute video is about shes all over the place this is crazy,NOT
im no vegan but im sure you can eat beans for protein,NOT
and now for my final thought if this mythical wage gap exists its due to your personal irresponsibility kids divorce etc thats your problem dont make it societys problem its called birth control youre woman i hear you roar now let me see you work,ABU
this documentary seems like celebrity boasted bullshit why not hear normal peoples views and concentrate on that,NOT
trish i have always loved and supported u but this is like so much as a pansexual trans man u cant just claim to be trans even tho  seconds later u say ur cis also singular theythem pronouns are completely valid if u are having confusing thoughts about gender and identity u need to figure ur shit out before u talk about it publicly bc rn u have no idea what ur talking about also someone doesnt have to have surgeries to be a man or a woman the person themselves desides if surgery is a thing they want to feel more comfortable pls do research figure ur shit out,NOT

i hate you prageru but this is a good video,NOT
i suspect a slight bias,NOT
carbs girl carbs  you can still eat junk sometimes you know and please eat a lot,NOT
ahhhhhh trishanooooo idk how to feel about this anymore i think you need a sit down with someone who knows more about this and figure yourself out off camera this is a really serious thing that i wish you left off the internet and figured it all out on your own first with a professional come on,NOT
trisha is so toxic idk why people love her she the absolute worst to me,NOT
agreed with this long ago we needed this video long ago,NOT
shouldnt the conclusion of this be maybe women shouldnt be expected to earn the same as a man while also having to shoulder the majority of the burden at home maybe men take on more domestic responsibility or accept that they may have to provide more financially if they expect their wife to run the home and raise the kids,NOT
here are my tips dont be shy to eat a lot eat until you are satisfied yay  eat your favourite fruits  veg bananas dates melons and avocados are my staples as they are calorie dense super yummy and versatile for carbs go all out rice pasta potatoes quinoa couscous bread cereal etc for protein i love beans lentils tofu nuts peanut butter but there are lots more options too you can find great meat options like the brand gardein  tofurky delicious also give smoothies and banana ice cream a try im sure you will love it ,NOT
elizabeth warren pays her female staff on average a median income of  percent of her male staff now she has five men who are in high level positions and this skews the numbers she has a lot of lowerlevel female staffers who make less and this skews the numbers elizabeth warren does not pay women less money for doing the same job she is not a sexist who pays women less for doing the same job rather her staff gender gap reflects differences in jobs however when she looks at the economy she believes women are making less money for doing the same jobs as men this is why nobody should ever be taken seriously who says equal pay for equal work as if this is what the numbers mean,NOT
the gender wage gap does not exist,NOT

fuckers this are men they should never run with the real girls,ABU
this documentary want to make me go out and slaughter baby cows lol,NOT
the problem is that in the current american culture we keep wagesalary a secret somehow thinking that its shameful or private or something and putting a huge taboo on revealing what we are paid to our coworkers when i worked a job that gave me access to payroll data i was shocked how much salaries varied between people doing exactly the same job who had identical experience and tenure when there are many jobs like that then the statistics become hard to extract the gender wage gap from the overall inexplicable wage disparities if every company published how much it paid each employee then we could figure out the breadth and depth of the gap,NOT
hey if you are still vegan try chia seeds for protien potatoes for starch seeds for fats veggies for vitamins fruits are also really goodim vegan as well so if you want any tips i can help you out just let me know girl,NOT
like ive always said wage gap is a joke ive said this exact thing years ago and was laughed at plus in most hourly wage jobs that require physical labor men are usually grossly underpaid while women are overpaid if youve ever worked in a warehouse type job that requires lifting you know im telling the truth the fact is men need fewer days off and we are genetically built to work women are built to reproduce thats not sexism its fact i respect women and if they can do the job they deserve to be paid for it more often than not they are men usually can work more hours and take fewer days off thats the gap not sexism,NOT

wow a fair video from vox this did not cover it all but it was honest earnings gape not wage gap,NOT
us is trisha trans trisha well yes but actually no,NOT
i truly agree with the video there is no gender wage gap i think having a wage gap is all mental a trick your mind plays because we see a large number of successful people being males an example from group  presentation would be the magazine forbes this magazine is successful people and most of the people on their front cover have been males i has agree with there being no wage gap from the beginning of speaking about the topic but never thought of speaking out and giving my opining because i thought i would been criticized and be looked as a bias person the fallacies in the argument is just like said in the video and command sense and its all about the choices each gender makes its command sense because if a guy and a girl both work at mcdonald they are both getting paid minimum wage same amount of money for the hour but all depends who wants to work more and longer hours an example how choices is key to an argument like the wage gap would be the saying of females live longer this is because its usually the male who pull out ridiculous dangerous stunts that sometimes kill them its all in the choices one makes there is no difference on how much females and males get paid like the video there is no gender wage gap they explain how the number  out of  dollar and that is just what average females make divided by what the average male makes all the factors that fall in to where the money goes people make counts too like said by the website the wage gap state by state that most families depend on the females overall its the factors and choices one makes that make males look like they are getting paid more,NOT

earnings gap compare wages for the same position in the same job and that silly gap disappears different pay for different positions is nomal in cases that there is a pay gap for the same work in the same position that is sexism ill need some citations if you find any company that does this and should be changed as it is illigal to pay a women less for the same work,NOT

as far as starbucks you can sub anything with coconut or soy milk theres gotta be great vegan restaurants in la thats the easiest way to introduce yourself into the diet theres a lot of normal food also it doesnt have to be labeled vegan technically oreos are vegan theres substitutes for everything just remember being vegan doesnt mean gnawing on kale and almonds  and dont beat yourself up or give up all together just because you slip once or twice its a big change and you cant expect everyone to transition into it easily every time you choose a cruelty free option youre helping the longer you go the easier and more rewarding it will feel also  from experience try not to bring it up in convo to new people,NOT
theres also the part about the same job the same amount of work the same workplace people will often focus on this especially sjws yet they dint understand that if this is actually the case then what theyre doing has been illegal since  when president john f kennedy passed a law that stated that with the exception of raises it is illegal to pay anyone less or more than any other for the same amount of work in the same profession at the same workplace people often miss things like this however in   women went on trial for this law and approx  in  were deemed legitimate which still works after adding in false negatives and removing false positives,NOT

oh and they make vegan ben  jerrys ice cream its soooo good,NOT
follow up question what factors might be influencing such unanimous choice if  of people choose something that is very suspicious for example imagine a political election with that kind of skewed result consequently the  difference is revealing of perhaps an inequity in treatment that cultivates these choices that presumably should be confronted at least considered and certainly not ignored,NOT
this video absolutely amazing ,NOT

you are stunning,NOT
shes probably just trolling like usual this response is still funny though,NOT
she says you can eat as much as you want without gaining weight on a vegan diet if you cycle as much as she does even she herself only eats  calories a day soy can also be the causes of breakouts by the way,NOT
so proud of you trish definitely eat a ton of carbs pasta bread etc and fruit in abundance,NOT
lots of these facts are actually outdated the top  best paying job statistics was from  years ago whilst the  worst was  years ago during this  year gap colleges have progressively invited more female students into colleges and some of the best fulfilling colleges dont accept women as often even today also you account womens maternity leave yet not a mans so that the gap seems closer i think both the extremist feminists and conservatives are both fabricating statistics the gap is more like  cents and there needs to be something done about it in an equality based manner,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense well i found my new catchphrase,NOT
nice goddamnit  keep going freelee ,NOT
a big issue that is often missed every company ive ever worked for has had many women who have refused promotions because the male spouse was self employed ie plumbers electricians etc the main goal was more about providing benefits like health and retirement that a selfemployed spouse could not provide,NOT

do i believe im transgender yes  do i identify as my naturally born gender yes   i cant,NOT
trish is such a joke this is just the trisha drama of the week she is just a liar and a troll,NOT
if you are using terms like feminazi or fembitch you are missing the whoooole point representation matters words matter you saggy white boys are running around crying because someone called us out on a legacy of privilege why do you feel threatened by a peer trying to get the same cut that you get because you are sexist cry babies,NOT
this video misses the point ok men do work in jobs that pay more and sometimes this is due to danger or time worked but it doesnt explain why a skilled but feminised profession like nursing which is both skilled and difficult pays fast food wages looking at the caring professions in general even skilled and important ones such as day care social work and nursing professions which women gravitate to and by coincidence they all pay low the argument that businesses would employ women if it were true wtf try and find  women oil rig workersor plumbersor engineers stooopid argument but industry happily does underpay in the professions that women prefer too complex to work out the reason nah in the past when women started working and moved into these fields men payed the wages and undervalued their work the present situation is a result of the past so we can say that the reason for this difference is complex which it probably is or acknowledge that it is unfair regardless of how complex the reason for the present factual situation is and rather than forcing women to move into jobs they might not care for pay them fairly where they predominantly can be found lastly im a guyi dont believe in the premise that this is all down to toxic masculinity but im also not going to deny what is right in front of me my sister is skilled and works with brain damaged adults getting payed  dollars an houri work as a night attendant at a university opening and closing doors requiring no skill or carei get  dollarshappy i dont careand thus get payed a living wage,NOT
ha ha blair wont read this,NOT
whoever did her make up did a great job i loved it it brought up her beautiful features,NOT

my home was pretty much the opposite my mum made the most money and worked two jobs while my dad worked at home made less money and looked after my brother and i,NOT
what did freelee say at ,NOT
great job freelee hope she sticks with it,NOT
yay trishi rt is my fav type of vegan diet especially if you like feeling satisfied good luck,NOT
statistics on wage gaps are almost usually manpliated to make it look like its a real thing but the reality is that when you put all the factors in and not just add the occupancies and wage per hour you can make a clear deduction that the gender wage gap is in fact horse manure and on par with the flat earthers who believe the earth is flat,NOT
 im gender fluid and im ok with my gender but sometimes im not and yes i have dysphoria so this kinda wrong,NOT
yayyy trisha watch that vegans couple new video good luck  oh and u live in la so im sure u have a ton of vegan fast food restaurants ps if it dosent  work out pleas at least stay vegetarian,NOT
you have to believe them um this is america i dont have to do anything except pay taxes and die,NOT
im sorry i dont comprehend this,NOT
yes the wage gap exists but not because of injustice or discrimination people in free capitalist societies are free to do whatever they want women and men make different choices in life and so they earn different medium wages since this is not an issue why do we need to address it why do we need to close the wage gap when this is the result of individual freedom,NOT
shes doing that voice thing that she used to do in her trolling videos,NOT
oh no facts as a feminist i need to ignore so i can continue my agenda,NOT
 unless i need to retake basic mathematics i believe that  is not  less than  but okay,NOT
so why call it a gender wage gap as opposed to a when are you available to work wage gap,NOT
i became vegan  years ago im so happy to be part of this im from latinoamerica,NOT
im pleasantly surprised at this video from vox also the gender wage gap to the dollar is actually around  cents less than men this is as the video states partially due to child bearing and raising a family but there is more to this part of it can also be women being told youll only make this much compared to men because of the wage gap so they dont strive to succeed more or perhaps move into a lesser job or even worse go into gender studies and only spend their life cursing the frightening patriarchy men generally being more aggressive when it comes to jobs as in more actively asking for a raise or promotion,NOT
you facist idiots the gender wage gap has been debunked several times,ABU
the wage gap is the difference between the gdp of women and men women avoid jobs like carpentry drywall plumbing roofing welding mining forestry flooring window and door installation home heating and cooling electrical wiring and power supply cement forming brick laying even for   hour with generous union benefits and lots of overtime women just dont want those jobs men to them and take home good pay cheques  feminists only look at big league ceos and corporate board rooms as the source of the wage gap when in fact the wage gap is created everytime they call for a plumber to fix their toilet or have a guy install a new tiles in the kitchen,NOT
this is so perfect you the woman talking are a smart person no one ever takes factors into account and boom theres the answer im saying anyone who thinks this is bull has no common sense end of story,NOT
you just need to make sure to eat enough you can eat as much as you want try to stick to raw foods and you may even need to count calories just to make sure your body is getting enough food this is amazing proud of you,NOT
hey i was wondering if anyone has any advice or anything ive been vegan for about six months and recently i got a stress fracture in my foot every time i tell someone they just say oh drink some milk or oh it must be because youre lacking calcium i know it probably doesnt have anything to do with veganism and my doctor even says it doesnt but i was just wondering if anyone has had any similar problems or if anyone could tell me if there actually is a correlation and i should be doing something different,NOT
good job trish,NOT
what the fuck also why does she look like this now,ABU
wage gap aka  bullshit,NOT
easy vegan protein black beans hummus peanut butter for any vegan meal you can add one of those for your protein d also check out unnatural vegans youtube channel ,NOT
it has been illegal to pay woman less than man since the s tho,NOT
those some slow as transgenders because my county would blow them just from looking at their lead from them other girls and they needa leave my sport alone because this makes me livid,ABU
what is this based vox im shook,NOT
thank you guys for this amazing work you do to make this world a better place,NOT
children decrease your income and increase your expenses significantly which is why i never understood why some people choose to have them does anyone know the percentage of children who were actually planned for those that were planned what were the reasons such as pressure from parents pressure from spouse etc some people will tell you they dont regret having unplanned kids but theyre just making the best of the situation since they couldve chosen them later or never at all if having children was so great then sex wouldnt need to be so awesome its lifes biggest scam,NOT
wouldnt this just be androgynous or nonbinary,NOT
me a trans man living my damn life trisha fucking paytas i choose to identify as male me a trans man imma head out,NOT
how many vegan women on this channel want to have sex with a real man instead of a soy boy vegan boy,NOT
make sure youre not just eating fruit and veg in a day you need protein and carbs like pastas and rice wholegrain if you want to be healthier otherwise your body will cling on to the natural sugars in the fruit and you wont loose any weight nuts and lentils are also important also those vegan donuts original chips are good ideas for salt and sugar in limited amounts still need those to be healthy just dont eat too much of them good luck,NOT
hey thats pretty good,NOT
you go girl but get those starches in fruit is great but oatmeal potatoes rice pasta with whatever you like on it as long as its vegan baked potatoes sweet potatoes whatever just that food is not enough to keep you satisfied ,NOT
somaybe make works hours more flexible just spitballing i have flexible starting and it makes it really easy to structure your day around family without being penalized for it,NOT
i love how she specified that she was trans female to male in case anyone tought she was mtf,NOT
ok i need a moment i need a few moments i think trisha is ummm there are no words im done ,NOT
wow we just seem determined to complicate life,NOT
if i owned a business i would only hire women because you can obviously pay them less think about it,NOT
right im done with feminists who wants to be a maninist,NOT
this world is full of ignorant people your life matters but animals life too whats for dinner verses whos for dinner the food that you eat is not something its someone you are not an animal lover when you choose to look after your pet and eat a different animal you dont kill them but pay someone to do so you kill them and they kill you back karmaillness,NOT
sis no please stop as a trans ftm guy this is not signs of you being transgender being trans isnt a joke the hormones we take literally will change you please seek a therapist and talk about this with them before posting a video and saying youre trans,NOT
vocal fry argh,NOT
omg the kitchen floor i fucking love you,NOT
 percent unfair,NOT
brilliant vid and ily  i do wish that everyone would be a little less cynicaljust a tadand realize that maybe its not for clicks or not just for clicks personally i think shes a very lost unhappy girl who is desperately searching for something anything to give her life meaning trans is trendy right now shes had a bit of body dysmorphia hated her boobs once feels like a tomboy sometimesso she puts those scraps together and turns it into im trans again shes just lost  she also is totally clueless obviously talking about im trans but i identify with my birth gender  she doesnt even know what shes talking about but yeah can we go easy on her a little shes just lost and desperate and grabbing for anything thatll be the one big answer to her life,NOT
personally i knew affluent upperincome  comparably successful women but im sure they dealt with sexism inequalities  secondclass treatment in life im told i have male privilege because of my biological sex then again i dont have a digit annual income nor a millionaire heck there are wealthy blacks  im not a wealthy white privilege person ,NOT
i have a lovehate relationship with freelee i love her when she makes positive videos promoting veganism personally im not vegan but i look at these videos for inspiration to help me lose weight  ,NOT
feminism vs feminazi feminazi sexism feminism logic feminazi triggered,NOT
no mention of women outearning men in their s no mention of women graduating from university at a ridiculously higher rate than men while men on average are more likely to go into a trade and become a plumberpainterbuildermechanic etc men virtually run the labor force but thats ok we dont want those stinky jobs we want to be ceos and scientists men are  of garbage collectors not a problem we dont want to collect garbage,NOT
i didnt you get breast implants,NOT
trishaim trans also trishawears makeup has had a lip implant has had a boob op wears so much damn makeup i have a trans bestie and this is an insult to her talking bout trisha btw,NOT
cant believe vox made a video like this,NOT
in hollywood men make more money than women theres an article from forbes about it the main reason for the gap in other industries is that women are bad negociating their salaries the solution is simple salaries should be discussed openly talk to friends on the same field ask for advice make research and then negociate,NOT
so essentially this video pushes the idea that women need to be given advantages over men in the workplace in order for them to earn the same amount of money to fix a nonissue how egalitarian,NOT
or dont have kids problem solved,NOT

lets go stop eating animal protein,NOT
 tell that to my mom,NOT
i am seriously considering going vegan however the one question i can not answer is what happens to the animals if they are culled either for food or not,NOT
i want to believe anyone who says they are transgender or that they have been raped just because they say so most of my life i have done that in these recent years when people have publicly declared that we have to believe everyone who says they are transgender or have been raped i think it is difficult to do so once you publicly declare you will believe someone you are just publicly recruiting pathological liars they cant even help it its our fault for publicly declaring unconditional and absolute belief,NOT
beans have a lot of protein and other nutrients eat a lot of greens for vitamins along with your fruits also nuts can be a good source of calories freelee is an extreme case she has a fast metabolism most likely but more importantly shes very active so she has to eat a lot of carbs for normal people who drive around the city all day you cant just eat a bunch of carbs and think youll get thin a lot of people becoming vegan eat too many carbs because they use starch as a replacement for meat starchy foods have a lot of calories and they turn into fat if you dont use the energy immediately you should check out the unnatural vegans channel here on youtube she has good advice and supports everything she says with evidence which a lot of other vegan youtubers dont or they think anecdotal evidence is sufficient when its not i think being vegetarian is enough for me but i end up eating vegan pretty often im mostly concerned about the environment though i also dont eat meat because i cant support killing animals for food in good conscience so it always brightens my day up a bit when someone wants to be vegetarian or vegan  good luck trish hope this finds you ,NOT
add another t in the acronym for trish shes her own damn thing,NOT
the dislike are the ones that eat meat and like and support crueltyperiod,NOT
theyre just gay boys the fuck you mean transgender,ABU
trisha you are to much  lol,NOT
cool good trish ,NOT
ok im vegan so here are some tips  make sure to eat enough calories because what you have there isnt enough  you can get vegan burgers or vegan meat and its really good amys is a really good brand and their vegan mac and cheese and burritos are amazing  most of the time ingredients lists will say contains soy milk wheat etc at the bottom so look at that  look into the different meat egg and dairy ingredients  trader joes has amazing vegan options they have really good dark chocolate and meat  look up vegan versions of your favorite food i really like pancakes so i looked up vegan pancakes and they are by far the best pancakes i have ever tried lastly a vegan diet is a very nice amazing diet if you eat enough calories you wont be hungry at all you have a sufficient amount of protein on a vegan diet and you also learn a lot more on how to keep your body healthy and strong if you dont want to quit completely on animal products do it a little slower i went vegetarian for  months and then vegan for a week then back to vegetarian the finally to a fully vegan lifestyle i hope you enjoy your vegan journey and make sure to keep all of us updated xoxo lexi,NOT

i can see freelee smiling from here ,NOT

yes im trans yes im cis yes we exist ,NOT
now im fine with transgender people but i dont want or would like them to call them female they are male by the rules of biology and this shows what the problem with them they will abuse the system as shown,ABU
well done trish for making the connection and giving veganism a try ive recently went vegan and it has made me feel amazing about what i eat id say do your research and watch youtube videos on easy vegan food ideas please stay vegan for life,NOT
why am i even here huh jezuz,NOT
oh have we decided to take trisha seriously did i miss a memo,NOT
according to trisha i a biological woman who is very much ok and likes being a woman am a man because i dont cover up pimples cool,NOT
cut out fats fat gives me huge breakouts,NOT
feminists wont be satisfied until the waitress at red lobster makes as much as the alaskan crab fisherman,NOT
i dont know how to answer that blaire im confused shes a biological white woman who identifies as a man whom wishes she was a black woman so she could sleep with gay guys,NOT
this is so stupid and unfair wtf,NOT
if i changed my gender id be playing for the canadian olympic hockey team scoring like mcdavid for fuck sake,ABU
the fact you did this on the kitchen floor though ,NOT
why does it seem there arent enough females in ceo positions etc let me explain simply in the work place if you want to get to the highest position possible you have to make sacrifices you cannot have everything your way its impossible you have to begin to work extremely long hours to get to the top which means you sacrifice your free time family time etc males are more willing to do this than females in general males dont have it all so why do feminists think they can males have to sacrifice their family time and free time etc because they may be travelling around the world a lot as part of their job women are natural caregivers and most females in general want to start a family because they have a limited of time to have babies women typically want more balance in their life they dont want to be juggling a high profile job family life and other responsibilities think about it thats alot of work for one person  especially considering how much work you need to put in if you have to raise a family it isnt easy for females because theyre natural caregivers and they typically tend to be more involved with family anyway  for example looking after the children taking them to school etc feeding them etc hence why women take on more part time roles and hence why the gender wage gap statistics are misleading if you work part time you earn less than a full time worker  fact women were actually happier in the s because they didnt have the responsibilities of having to work high profile jobs look after the home look after the kids like more women may be experiencing today furthermore another reason that explains why there arent more women in high profile positions is because of competitiveness and personality females are competing not only with females but males too males are naturally and evolutionary more competitive due to their natural dominant traits so having to compete with other females and other males isnt exactly easy females typically have an agreeable personality unlike males in general what this means is females are less likely to disagree with something and be vocal about it in general if females want to succeed in these types of environments and get promotedearn more money they must take on these male traits competitiveness and dominance women must sacrifice a portion of their femininity in order to gain equality of outcome just like men would have to sacrifice their masculinity otherwise known as toxic masculinity to feminist sjws in order to create equality of outcome desired by feminists feminists dont understand that having both a mother and father in a high profile job that requires lots of working hours requires time away from their kids whos lives are gonna get affected the kids they are missing out on family time and its going to affect how they are raised because their parents may be too busy working to give them attention and the care  thus potentially resulting in the children to grow up unnaturally independent and not unattached to their parents distant to conclude im generalising here so dont comment saying i can manage because youre a minority which i acknowledge hence why i said in general,ABU
people miss the fact that it doesnt exist,NOT
wow so much hate,NOT
sorry offtopic what is that lip product you are rocking i love it,NOT
i can tell you why there is a minor wage gap women dont know how to negotiate like jordan peterson says women are more agreeable those that arent make more money they need to learn how to reject offers and fight as hard as men do to make as much as they can,ABU
dont starve exercise more,NOT
feminist wanted this so let it be its hurting them instead,NOT

i hate when femenist bring this up as a fact just ask them how that would even be a thing if the constitution states itd be illegal and why dont companies hire way more girls if theyre cheaper,NOT
thats why they get paid less,NOT

technically businesses dont exclusively staff women because its discriminatory which is illegal otherwise yeah this whole situation is pretty bunk so are the many quite like it information is all well and good but how are you gonna use it what are you going to do about this,NOT
also check out supreme banana shes my favorite vegan youtuber super sweet and down to earth not offputting at all and she has a lot of what i ate today videos and helpful recipes and hacks that make it a lot easier my favorite sources of protein are black beans quinoa certain greens sprouted grain bread and even good old vegan protein powder if the greens are hard for you as they are for me just throw them in a smoothie or even blend them into pancake batter so much easier to get them down that way,NOT

i love thiss,NOT
after three years of being vegetarian ive turned vegan in october i should have done this way earlier,NOT

what about all the  woman who have earned more than their male counterpart when variables are identical,NOT
freelee lost all her weight when she was totally raw vegan she got slim as a raw vegan then mentained her slim body with rt but now she is not necessarily doing rt but she is still vegan no no no you cant eat as much as you want on a vegan diet you will get fat so many people have got fat on rt you need to eat less on to lose weight and you have to do cardio you will gain weight if you follow rt you need to find a vegan diet that helps you to cut look for a vegan body builder and follow the diet they use for cutting you need some professional help check our jon vegus he is a vegan body builder his girlfriend katherine is a trained nutritionist and does meal plans and coaching for people like your self so go check out there website and their youtube,NOT

the human body is carnivorous it isnt capable of processing plants,NOT
if we pay women less why hire men,NOT
the bitch is doing it all for publicity send her to the gallows,ABU
if a feminist tries to bash you with the wage gap myth just show them this vid,NOT
there are two sides to it the gap on different fields is what people look at but women tend to go into lower paying jobs to begin with but then there is the argument that if a man and a women are doing the exact same job and lets say they started on the exact same day and can work the exact same amount of hours the man still seems to make more over all,NOT
okay first love your cat second it truly amazes me how people cannot be somewhere in the middle the gender expression scale without apparently being transgendernon binary just because a girl doesnt want to wear make up everyday doesnt mean shes transgender if that was fact then shit guess im not actually a girl then,NOT
all women likes to find ways  complain about mens,NOT
thank you so much for the dairy thing that has to do with breakouts im going to try it,NOT
watch the vegan couples videos,NOT

so proud of you trish,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap that it doesnt exist commies understand the economy about as well as a flatearther understands special relativity,NOT
im not an expert on the trans experience esp bc i am not trans myself but i see a lot of things that are problematic with what youre saying trish  if u dont feel happy being solely a woman  but also id as a woman sometiems while simultaneously iding as a man then maybe what youre trying to say is that youre gender non conforming however when it comes to oh i want to be a guy bc they dont have the same expectation from society that doesnt justify wanting to be a man at least in my opinion of course its up to you how you want to id  i dont want to silence you at all but i want to make sure youre saying these things as someone whos actually informed on what it means to be lgbtqia  no hate for you just want you to be informed love you trish,NOT
so because your lazy and thick you just want to become a boy ,NOT
trisha deserves zero respect from everyone and anyone,NOT

trish its called personality traits ugh,NOT
well if you go on a boat trip with your coworkers and then the boat sinks all men would be left to die but the women would be saved maybe thats enough for the wage gap question,NOT
most people forget feminism means equality for women and men not just women or just men,NOT
im so proud of trish and im glad that shes getting the message out there ,NOT

i told my sister and my best friend the wage gap didnt exist they laughed at me and said i was an idiot whos the idiot now the person who actually questions what they are told and looks into a topic or the person who blindly believes everything that they are told without a second thought,NOT

those  boys are crazy they think they are girls and the parents are duchebags,ABU
i have never been so confused in my life what the actual hell is going on,NOT
those girls are ugly as fuuuuck,NOT
how much of the gap is explained by the lack of standardized paid maternal leave in the us thats one of the main things i was hoping to find out im not angling for a certain number or anything if its negligible thats fine but i was hoping it would get mentioned if only briefly,NOT
vox is far left propaganda the wage gap is a myth,NOT
as you pretty much strip down daily on instagram and do softcore porn on pateron but dont feel like a female,NOT
you work at the same job but do you work as a manager with a good education background and for  hours a day no then dont complain you make  cents less now go make me a sandwich,NOT
they can also do more pull ups push ups and sit up than those born girls the girls who came in rd and th place are the real st and nd place winners i have absolutely nothing against the transgender community be who you feel you are in your soul but come on this should be a no brainer this shouldnt even be a debate,NOT
there isnt a gender wage gap there is a flaw in the age wage system though someone whos  will receive less per hour because of their age and everyone  are entitled to more how so some  year olds have houses kids etc and some people over  dont some younger people may put more effort in and dont doze about like some over s do but because of their age theyre paid less or more so much mucking about how about paying more based on experience effort and responsibility rather than their age then theres noncewood and indoctrination centres known as schools and most braindead politicians the ones that dont live in the real world just have beans and crisps and shut up you hypocritical virtue signalling nonces greed thats all it comes down to today and why we have such a dysfunctional system that affects many people especially younger,NOT
i cant tell whether shes seriously mentally fucked up  delusional or if shes just a serious troll for attention and is desperate for views either way shes definitely seperated from reality big time,NOT
onlyfans is not just for nudes its literally a private instagram in where you can post videos and photos that you cant share due to guidelines trolls etc its a perfect way your fans to support you and you can be authentically yourself,NOT
ok i know trisha is getting a lot of backlash about this and some of her reasoning might not make a lot of sense but honestly if this how she feels then we should support her,NOT
lool at  she just made a gender comparison and stated that it wasnt sexism just common sense common sense is probably why more women chose unfortunately i dont think individuals really have a choice in social environments they are in,NOT
stop sending me adds i hate your channel i vehemently disagree with your views you have a right to them but stop spamming every ad i see on yt,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women it does not take into account different job positions or education levels,NOT
shes the reason i subscribed  ,NOT
i really think cristina hoffsummers is awsome,NOT
the waaaaaaaaage gap isnt real,NOT
great video good explanation the left is not interested in facts at all,NOT
how did you get that download option next to the subscribe button,NOT
i dont think i have ever ever been more confused by a video,NOT
ha stupid feminists this video acknowledging from the start that the wage gap exists and having a frank discussion about the causes and nuances of the issue and how we should to approach changing it proves that the wage gap isnt real on a feminist channel no less but of course its just what weve all been saying for years if only those stupid sjws would stop hearing only what they want to hear there seems to be a lot of this in this comments,NOT
they have a huge advantage you cant deny it its totally not fair to the rest of the team you cant deny the difference in physical strengh between male and female its not allowing the girls on the team to excell and maybe make a state championship or get a college schlorship it seems to me they expect everyone to bow down to them and to bad if you dont like it as long as their happy thats all they seem to care about you can be transgender all you want but some things about your birth identity will never change,ABU
guys how does this sound mandatory paid maternity and paternity leaves gasp,NOT
do dogs have brain,NOT
these are guys period let them compete with other transgenders,ABU
lol woman are so stupid for choosing careers that care for people and shit,ABU
why is everyone in this comments section so threatened by the myth of the wage gap even the video admits that there is around a  unexplainable wave gap its just a fact that women on average earn less,NOT
who ever dislikes this video has  iq,NOT
doesnt wear makeup when she isnt getting dressed up im a gay man,NOT
cut their balls of first,ABU
transgender woman r real woman people need to get this,NOT
im sorry who are these people making k  year out of business school,NOT
if you add all the factors such as the jobs men do then you will easily see that wage gap is not a thingalso its more common for females to stay home with there new born and take more time of then a man so simply adding all the factors up you can clearly tell wage gap is not a thing,NOT
close your eyes and listen to the voices  male and male leave the girls alone,ABU
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha america is too funny,NOT
holy fkin christthe unthinkable has happened the cow has finally decided to not kill its neighbor,NOT
in short the wage gap is women making the decision to work less and shock getting paid less as a result,NOT
men should take care of the children no it has always been women even back to the stone age they are biologically fit for taking care of kids,ABU
i love how they said all the strongest animals in the world are vegans and used a chimp as an example but little do they know chimps eat meat and hunt other monkeys and eat them,NOT
when i first saw this video it was kind of hilarious to me and now as a young  yr old it bothers me i new i was a trans man for about a year before this video was recommended to me but it hurts because shes kind of mocking and making fun of how i and other people feel she is making young children feel as if theyre not valid because of the idiocy in that video then she just goes about her channel as if she hadnt spread miss information about what transgender people feel yes she might be confused but putting it out on the internet is not the best thing to do,NOT
i went vegan a little over  months ago after finding out my blood pressure and cholesterol levels were high i have lost  pounds blood pressure and cholesterol are normal loads of energyand no more headaches and backaches i will never look or think about meatdairy again,NOT

wtf is this real social fucking justice at work,ABU
get beans lentils rice i suggest a lot of starches so you can get the satisfied feeling that you are use to then start eating more lighter foods as you become more active and ect read up on the starch solution and always be low fat and dont use any oil in your cooking for the best health results you may not loss a lot of weight right away because your digestive system will be cleansing and getting use to higher volumes of food,NOT
i remember when my school in england did an assembly about a wage gap its good that most of my friends laughed at it because how they are trying to brainwash us into being anti trump leftist lgbt libtards,NOT

haha your so right she is so dumb,NOT
dawwwww your cat is too cute ,NOT
thank you for existing and being you blaire,NOT
super proud of you trish,NOT
to sum this up men are generally more able to take on the schedules that pertain to higher paying jobs than women because women are more likely to be caught up taking care of a child in their s or s,NOT
even doe i have two family members who are gay and a godchild who is trans as a straight male this not my place to judging thisha now u perez and gigi made good points when it comes to and even days after thisha video her words still have outrage the community it about the same backlash that kevin spacy face when he came out as gay he was accused of bad behavior with a young costar,NOT
pharmaceutical sales aka pretty women selling men boner pills,NOT

i identify as a unicorn therefore ima unicorn,NOT
as soon as i saw the title of trishas video i went straight to freelees channel to see her reaction,NOT
james charles version im attracted to straight guys so that makes me a straight female,NOT
this also forgets to mention that there are far less women then men to get tech and engineering degrees and that is by choice of the individual women themselves you dont see a ton of men going into nursing because its not what a vast portion of men want to be doing women dominate nursing because a lot more of women value that field of work and lets face it some fields of work are more profitable then others,NOT

it doesnt matter whether or not shes trolling or if shell stick with it  if we treat her kindly with respect and thoughtful support if we help educate her and encourage her not only will trish be more likely to really stick with the plant based diet and hopefully cut out animal consumption in other areas of her life but it helps spread the message to all of her audience so her followers can see that vegans arent crazy pushy freaks but are actually just concerned people who want to help animals that could help a lot more people go vegan than just attacking trish for oh shes just trolling oh she cant do it lets remember to extend our compassion to everyone,NOT
eat as much food as you want from whole plant sources make sure you eat beans potatoes pasta and rice as well as fruit,NOT
this is such a stunt trish is just helping you get your channel back you know you knew she was going to make this video if she decided on her own to make this video which i doubt she did she would have sent you a text telling you hey im going vegan smh but hey what ever works for yall hope all her subs help you out,NOT

no shit they won theyre men regardless of what they think they are which is fine but if they are taking part in physical challenges how you identify shouldnt matter one fucking bit  it is irrelevant they are men they should be competing against men or we should make a special trans olympics if necessary,ABU
if i dont make the nba draft and i need money im gonna identify as a female im gonna try out for a wnba team im most likely gonna make the team im gonna make good money find a wife and start a family all while still identifying as a female prove me wrong im   pounds,NOT

lets talk about the draft gap  women died after being drafted for every  men during ww and vietnam smh lets get that number equal,NOT
there dudes disgusting,ABU
i listened to this with an open mind hoping to learn something new about the socalled pay gap that i may have in fact been missing i had been under the impression that the gap is a myth but was looking to hear other explanations as to why it persists all i learned from watching this video is that its creators seem to take issue with the fact that women have choices and that they choose different paths in life that men do not and in some cases cannot this is why i cant support modern feminism as it is most often expressed in the mainstream its a bunch of women shaming men for being men and shaming women for daring not to devote themselves to the corporate rat race and instead choosing to focus on their homes and families feminists have created deep confusion and unhappiness in several generations of men and women but especially women who i am finding feel increasingly pressured to achieve while at the same time being keenly aware that their youth and fertility are slipping away those that do have children feel guilty and ashamed for being away from their children in order to work while simultaneously feeling resentment that they are spending the bulk of their time caring for another human being and staying at home with each passing day i grow more and more disillusioned with feminism because i see the misery and internal conflict it is causing constantly ive come to the conclusion that feminists only care about themselves they care about being seen to fight for a cause they care about proselytizing and spreading their feminist faith to the masses but they do not care about women,NOT
i have to say that as a video i think the this one isnt as good as the  and  videos not sure why could have just been my own state of mind or something but i feel like it was lacking something and was maybe a bit lacklustre somehow despite that this is still such a moving and inspirational review of the progress that has happened and i am still very happy about it ,NOT
do i identify as a transgender man  do i identify as my natural born gender  these are the  most stupid and utterly ridiculous sentences i have ever heard come out of someones mouth,ABU

do those dudes still have their cock attached if they cut their dicks of they should be able to compete,NOT
i recently said to a feminist instead of gender quotas why dont feminist just encourage men who are willing to step aside for equality to do so im sure alot of males out there would happily give up there job to play video games or watch sports all day allowing women to come in and fill the jobs those males leave behind she got so angry at the thought of males sitting home playing video games all day while women like her had to go out and work hard encouraging males in good positions who are willing to quit basically gives the same end result as gender quotas more males wont have those jobs and more females will but boy do feminist hate the thought of the men who lose those positions actually enjoying free time as unemployed people i dont believe in gender quotas or encouraging men to step aside for equality just knew the thought of a man being happy playing video games all day while women like her had to go to work would really piss off feminists and give me a good laugh,NOT
you should definitely try to look up fast food vegan options or cupcake places for the long term but for right now id suggest eating lots of fruitveggies mostly you can easily find meatcheeseetc substitutes but fruit is probably the best option for you trying to lose weight quickly also if you spend a whole day eating fruit youre going to be bloated by the night its not bad trust me its all gone by the time you wake up,NOT
thats a pre filmd vid,NOT
the wage gap has been illegal for over  years what youre talking about is an earnings gap which is made primarily of the choices of the women since the majority of women work less bourse than men,NOT

the best thing isits told by a women,NOT
shes a literal chaser,NOT
trisha really out here getting shit from tumblr,NOT
after watching  there is no gender wage gap it has left me with a lot of questions and some clarification on certain things this video proves that there is a gender wage gap but it also clarifies where and how there is a gap between women and men pay i think that the main thing that is being overlooked would be that not all women can work full time or half the time that men do because of child care and other obligations that they have as a woman usually it is just known that woman do all the housework and childcare while the man is out working and making money why dont women get paid the same amount that men do especially when they are doing more work then just their employed job if the situation was flipped and women got paid more i dont think that men would let it go by as easily as the women do not by choice but that its just what the case is with professional soccer in general whether male or female it has a lot of work put into it the video why is womens soccer so white it points out a lot of things that differ from men and women professional soccer teams the pay gap with men and women ties into the soccer world because men get paid a lot more than the women do and the fact of the matter is that the women bring home more titles than the men a quote in the reading paid disparity in us soccer that stood out to me is equal pay for equal work is this not a true statement just because the womens team are women and not men so in the end is it just sexism taking a tole,NOT
you need more carbs girl rice pasta potatoes quinoa noodles etc youre going to feel weak eating just watery fruit,NOT
christina hoff sommers is the one who milo mention as a source,NOT
we are slowly getting back too god with people like these it will take time but it is working,NOT
so sad that women putting children first is now considered an inconvenience and a burden but it does explain part of why the country is getting so messed up,NOT
this is explained by the fact that all the higher paying jobs demand more time working when women are still expected to take care for children it is because the hour arent flexible enough that there is a gender pay gap corporates dont choose women even if they work at lower wages because they are not viewed as workers but rather as women who have to be available to their children at home tasks are still managed almost entierely by women even when both parents have full time jobs the gender pay gap therefore exists you should be ashamed to post such ignorant content,NOT
make sure to buy vegan junk food ,NOT
trisha i think when she says you can eat unlimited calories she means like raw fruits and vegetables,NOT

too much makeup can cause your skin to break out too the chemicals in some makeups make your skin break out,NOT
you dont have to eat just fruit  you can have burrito bowls it has rice beans avocado tomatoes beans burritoswraps ugh you got so much options girl,NOT
the thing i wanted to hear during this claim that its not sexist but didnt was why are the choices women make prefer paid significantly less than the choices men make prefer if someone answers that the fields men choose are more significant or important im going to throw something it appears that either society could care less about the caring for humanity fields or about paying higher wage for women dominated fields this is crucial but wasnt studied so the study is spurious,NOT
ok guys in traditional households earn more because they work more than women if women wanted to be a sole provider and the man to be the child caretaker that could work but since this is traditional thats how we get the average,NOT

holy shit trisha needs to quit the botox,ABU
the comments are filled ignorance smh,NOT
im pro vegan but against forcing people into a certain behaviour,NOT
hmm its blantantly ignorant to say that there is no pay gap i mean its clear that the average woman does make less than the average man but its not anyones fault but the women who are making the choices that are holding them back from economic success theres many variables and traits that exist within this  cents to the dollar thing the largest ones but not the only ones being mother hood the fact that women choose lower paying jobs and competitiveness so while i agree with the statistics that feminists just need to stop bitching because nothing can be done to put more money in their wallets because its already illegal to pay people more or less based on discriminations such as race or sex but the message that the gap isnt real is just going against facts theyre not really anyones fault but they are facts women make less than men fact of life quit having children and work more maybe youll make the same amount,ABU

is guy at  the teacher off willy wonker lol,NOT
cant feminists just start their own all female companies hiring only womenthe anti male biased laws would totally allow that and the government would hand them tons of tax money too,NOT
this video proved to me that there is a gender wage gap in the example of the georgetown university  top paying majors and  least paying majors the  out of the  top paying majors dominated by women was pharmaceutical science and  out of  lowest paying majors dominated by women were counseling and psychology early childhood education human services and community organization and social work i think one of the variables that needs to be taken into account is a females natural aptitudes and their value to society for example the history of stenography and secretarial work demonstrates the history of how a once maleonly profession became available to women but at the cost of lower pay because they could secretarial work and stenography was only a male profession colleges that taught these subjects only admitted males historically this is the recent past if you go far back in history the work of scribes a once highly honored position was also the work of males from the book out of the kitchen and into the office by lynn peril a case history of poaching jobs from men unlike typing stenography had a long history of male practitioners in  the author of starting in life what each calling offers ambitious boys and young men warned his readers that save for the as yet mostly male bastion of the newspaper office the woman stenographer had become an office fixture and necessity women had even infiltrated the ranks of court reports where they had been long considered too delicate to hear the litany of greed murder lust and corruption not to mention the occasional indecency of language they might be subjected to when taking trial testimony the reason for womens success as stenographers was obvious the author concluded so long as the woman continues to work at a lower price than is paid to the man for a similar service the man cannot compete with the woman on what may be assumed to be the womans ground he thus warned boys to pause and reflect and then to pause again and to continue to reflect for several days or weeks before entering a profession which has comparatively few prizes to offer and has very little substantial reward even for those who draw a prize the women it seemed had devalued what once had been a mans noble calling i hope the above provides a good example of how womens work has been devalued historically and why i as a medical transcriptionist for  years with a year work history in the field of just secretarial work am presently paid the same wages as a garbage truck driver would make at the start of his career if it was up to choice why would i not have chosen to be a garbage truck driver could it possibly be because of the strength requirements ie a males natural aptitude,NOT
for protein eat quinoa its so so good and very good for you ,NOT
just wanted to thank anyone responsible for getting this circulated into the ads on you tube  i happened to be watching skeptic videos but i hope its not just limited to appear in that content because itll never be seen by those that need to see it if thats the case,NOT

she said for  weeks,NOT
maybe the start of the end of women competing in sports,NOT
what people miss about the wage gap it doesnt exist if you count the number of hours women on average work it narrows to roughly  if you take into account the different careers women choose it narrows down to  if you consider how women are less likely to ask for a promotion from their boss it narrows to  or even in some cases ,NOT

 the year fast food went vegan ,NOT
broccoli has soooooo much protein as well as spinach and quinoa beans are super super good for you so eat those keep away from soy because too much of it can actually mess up your hormones and remember to eat lots of healthy carbs rice and potatoes are key,NOT
would you eat supermeat idk how to explain it bc idk the science behind it but there is a few videos on it  i want to know your opinion on it,NOT
i doubt this she likes junk food way too much,NOT
the weird thing is if you really got to pay women less than men even if they had the same amount of experience work productivity etc there would be companies willing to hire way more women than men cheaper labor also you never hear the companies that are supposedly paying women so much less than men why because it doesnt really exist again men generally choose fields that pay more than fields that are dominated by women men and women simply make different career choices because shockingly men and women are different,NOT
how do i go vegan if i am young and live with my parents they cook me dinner and serve meat and dairy do i have to wait till im older,NOT

very thankful for this channel i travel for my job and vegan options are getting easier and easier it still isnt even close to how good it could be very excited for the future keep it going guys your making a huge difference in peoples lives thank you,NOT
so the gender wage gap does exist but there are many variables and no apparent reason why,NOT
as a liberalsocialist i have to say that this video completely changed my opinion on the gender wage gap while i still think that a certain degree of sexism might be involved ie some stem jobs are seen as maleonly jobs reducing the number of female graduates i admit that i was wrong,NOT
why are women so butthurt men are expected to pay for everything anyways,NOT
look out trish there are pink slugs trying to eat your face,NOT

why do women chose lower paying professions at a higher percentage than men,NOT
i need to be honest with you freelee i was very much disappointed with you when i first saw your videos but hey you made me turn into vegan babe  months now and this is because i am very much influenced by you and your videos damn thank you girl,NOT
yesssss im vegan woman,NOT
and this is why the wage gap is more sexist towards men than women men are seen as the expendable workers who are expected to work or even give their own life to provide for women they are forced by society to take higher paying and more dangerous jobs while women either stay at home and live comfortably off of their husbands money or work in a comfortable low paying job men are seen as expendable workers who must respect and provide for women and women are seen as holy princesses who have to live their lives comfortably this is also why men arent allowed to hit women because women are the mens superiors and must be treated with respect and care its also why women have their feelings coddled and cared for when men are expected to never show their emotions women deserve to have their feelings cared for because theyre not expendable and no one gives a shit about mens emotions because they are expendable,NOT
im sad cuz its only been  days since she posted this video and i see today on snapchat shes eating chicken and waffles  wth trish ,NOT

women choosing career that requires nurturing  compassion is  okay its their choice feminazis should never demonize them just because they chose what they love to do although i will argue that most of these hard working women deserves more i mean example teachers family councilors nurses these women are the people who shape our children who in turn will shape our future they help us a lot to make the families which is the core of our society intact their impact in our society is not as obvious but they do play a big  important role in developing it so yes they deserve more maybe not in the same way as doctors or engineers or lawyers because these professions require a lot more technical skills but they do deserve a better standard of living in our society,NOT

my hourly wage is less than my supervisor i however have probably earned more money total than my supervisor since i stated this job  months ago is that somehow descriminate against my supervisor no thats my supervisor and myself being given the option to earn alot of overtime if we were willing to work the hours my supervisor chose to skip the extra hours except for when he absolutely had to work i however went  months straight of going to work every single day and then getting off days only sparringly and thats when they force me to take off my supervisor gets every weekend off but if you looked at only the end result of total money earned youd ask why is the supervisor earning less than someone positioned under them people who believe the wage gap idiocy will claim the supervisor is somehow being descriminated against when in reality as with the wage gap idiocy its because of our different choices,NOT
if that makes sense everyone else no honey it doesnt make sense,NOT

i have been vegan since  and definitely not going back to meat veganism is not just a trend is a lifestyle that benefits you and the planet in so many ways just by standing for our animals and our planet,NOT
so women earn less because they and men think that woman is the only one who is responsible for domestic works therefore it still is a gender problemthat is what you are missing vox and this is only us statistics what about the other countries for example things are very messed up in turkey they really do pay less a female engineer and a male engineer for no reason,NOT

obama was a community organizer,NOT
if you really cared about your sons future you would have raised them to be a men and lest anyone gets confused about what it means to be a man a man is defined by his character not his penis or lack there of and there are no compelling arguments on the side of the males racing against females just feelings that lack empathy for their opponents,ABU
she is money hungry she will stoop to anything just for attention,NOT
i dont even see whats wrong yes maybe trisha worded some things wrong but at the end of the day shes questioning let her,NOT
how can there possibly be anything were missing i mean every time we ask a question were told its absolute truth and were terrible people,NOT
as a business owner if i could hire women to do the same job as men and get away with paying them less i would have only women working for me so would every other business this statement alone should be enough to end this debate once and for all,NOT
advanced troll love,ABU
trish i love you but i dont think your transgender or whatever like you said you have male energy sometimes just like other women do not all women are girly girls just be trish,NOT
stop this ride i want to get off,NOT

rice oats and beans will fill you up  i like to cook some oats in whatever vegan milk i have then add in some fruits and maple syrup on top and i would make a buddha bowl which i am sssooooo obsessed with these days just mix whatever veggies you want with rice and beans and honestly whatever makes you happy and whatever sauce you want and there you have it a nice healthy lunch,NOT
the biology of the male and female brain is different women are better at emotions empathy and compassion where as men are more logical cold and driven its evolution and if you want to say it this way evolution due to sexism over thousands of years,NOT

and youre still a dude,NOT
oh nooooo not this one ugh thats the girl who has so little concern for her own dignity that she shovels food down her throat  smacks like a piece of trash for youtube dollars my eyes are literally rolling seeing that its the same person i saw once in a video  was so repulsed  angered that i couldnt get through it so now shes trying to grab even more attention by jumping on this train why im surprised at all i just dont know this is one of the reasons that this shit has got to chill all these people calling themselves trans to get attention  be petted as someone special its diabolical,NOT
i would say that you should check out vegan restaurants just because its really hard in the beginning so you need to ensure that there are great vegan alternatives that way you wont want the typical non vegan foods ,NOT
i knew nothing about this and i dont usually watch your videos as soon as they come out but girl this title i am here at  views,NOT

i almost threw up in my mouth watching this bullshit those are young men that need an exorcism done and sit the fuck down somewhere,ABU
this is frelalas fault,NOT
as a nb teen this video makes me so uncomfortable you invalidate people in this state that being trans is a choice and overall are just digging yourself into a hole educate yourself on this shit before you try and claim to be transgender when youre not and have it all wrong,NOT
whats really sad is most teachers dont even know this ive had so many teachers both male and female push the antiwage gap agenda without real back up,NOT
wow look how much america cares about animals more than peopleslavery  crimes against humanity,NOT
never been here faster,NOT
trisha dont listen to the rawtil diet that freelee is going to feed you look at videos from plenty of vegan youtubers about how she and her boyfriend have influenced a  year old girl to gain  pounds in a year on rawtil they are criminals i think you should go vegan but find different sources other than freelee,NOT

you should try sweet patatoes and rice with hot sauce its bom,NOT
great if there is such a wage gape why arent businesses firing men and hiring more women they would save a fortune,NOT
well said once again i wonder what your opinions are on indya moore from pose they identify as nonbinary but is incredibly feminine and always presents as female im just starting to become a bit more openminded about nonbinarygenderqueer but i still think its usually just kids trying to get attention and then claim oppression,NOT
why are the computers broccoli,NOT
so stupid you have the bodies of males no wonder you are breaking every record,NOT
there should be a gender pay gap women suck as workers if there werent laws against gender discrimination i think a lot of employers wouldnt hire them men do all the hard work while the women socialize with their obnoxious coworker friends and barely break a sweat anyone who has worked a job that requires manual labor has observed this they get paid for doing barely anything they are the laziest workers a man could do their  hours of work in one hour paying a woman who barely does shit the same as a man who does all the work is not reasonable,NOT
men try to earn a higher salary as a way to get a wife this is obviously truer between the age of  and  when men are more likely to be looking for a wife then theres the fact that men are more likely to be relied on as a breadwinner not sure that is a social privilege to be honest so they work longer hours with less flexible and favourable conditions and negotiate more aggressively for salary women dont generally prioritise work in the same way so they n average earn less very simple there is no need to forcibly engineer society the way feminists want to see it there is no wage gap the proposed solutions for it are almost invariably profoundly sexist and illiberal also  focusing on making hours flexible rather than on the quality of the end productservice sounds like a recipe for a failed company,NOT
its dudes competing against women its unfair,ABU
today i have been vegan  days best thing i ever did,NOT
vegan for  years now best choice ever,NOT
solution breed genderless people via cloning in the laboratory  an artificial womb all war between the sexes solved,NOT
the introduction to this video alone hit me really really fucking hard i was a tomboy as a kid got teased for it and felt a lot of pressure to be hyperfeminine as i got older it took me years to realize that as much as i loved being good at being feminine i didnt like how i looked literally everything youre saying about penis envy about how i felt a struggle between wanting to be a good feminist or a better stronger woman and this nagging idea that i was actually a guy it felt like a betrayal for me to give up my identity as a woman but now that im three and a half years on testosterone i know that my body is meant to have t in it kicking gender norms to the curb and escaping the conforms of what society tells you that you have to be being a gender nonconforming man choosing to forgo hormones or getting hormones and surgery all of those are perfectly reasonable you dont have to go hypermasculine to be a gay trans man hell you could date other gay trans men but at any rate youre absolutely welcome here youre not faking being trans theres no correct way to be trans,NOT
one of the only decent vox videos,NOT
trish is proof that money doesnt bring you happiness she is such a miserable mess ,NOT
a gay trans men is that not a straight woman,NOT
plz continue doing your research,NOT
wow thats a big baby love it,NOT
rather than developing a interesting and fair debate on how we look at gender pay gap reports all this video does is reduce the issue to flawed simplistic arguements that suit a certain demographic of people while the arguement that the way gender pay is calculated may be too simplistic could be a valid this video abandons any hope of a nuanced debate by peddling the notion that most pay gap issues we see is due to the choice of women that will please all the antifeminists that believe women are trying to take their rights away not sure how youtubes algorithm landed this video inside my echo chamber probably missclicked on too many man on motorbike fights cop videos,NOT
i dont think theres anything wrong with what she said,NOT
she is a professional troll,NOT
men are more likely to work longer hours without advance notice  what im not a man lol,NOT
when vox actual tells facts,NOT
i dont understand the fascination with balancing the wages of men and women it is illegal to pay women less than men for the same job end of discussion what happens if the wages between men and women are balanced will society as a whole join together around a campfire and sing songs about how we are finally equal i doubt it unless there is a clear discrimination happening then this is just a pointless thing to argue about,NOT
just run faster ahahahahahaha omfg,NOT
sounds alarm shannneeee shane shane here is your next project help save her before its too late,NOT
it aint real,NOT
omg  i think she is more counfused than me in math,NOT
bahahha my nail polish is gonna last longer than this,NOT
well people shouldnt assume that a woman is confined by hours and household responsibilities or future child bearing responsibilities it is not for all women,NOT
hmm it is kind of wierd and even absurd that they calculate average salary that way it is more correct to campare sums they pay to males and females for the same vacancy,NOT
how does your mind make up all this crap,NOT
i think trisha took comments on her videos about her being the boy who cried wolf a bit too literally,NOT
flexible hours for everyone ,NOT
good video i did not expect a description of reality i was on high alert for pandering and misinformation and was pleasantly surprised though i will say until women prefer men who stay home and find value in homelife there will continue to be disproportionate homework responsibility disparities hypergamy exists cross culturally and racially and is one of the contributing factors that men for better or worse place a higher importance on working all the timebeing a provider to attract a mate  poise themselves for a family,NOT
imagine strahan tackling a woman the way he would tackle brett favre i rest my case,NOT
lol trisha has been doing trolling videos for years i dont know why you guys think shell be canceled,NOT
nice propoganda here vox,NOT
and the comments are a war zone why am i not surprised whats interesting is that shes basically saying similar things that christina hoff sommers has said in a video i saw a while ago its similar points but their conclusions are different this video has more stats and research if you all are getting upset about findings that academics have made cause of their research then im not really sure what to say to you,NOT
why do we not have a law that states that all old crones with dry vaginas are worthless and should forfeit their jobs to all the men maybe the worthless vagina should just shut up and buy some progesterone cream why did prader u waste their money on this stupid female why is she even talking doesnt she know shes worthless after the age of  moisten your dry menopausal vagina and go home and save prader u some money and stop talking because women should be seen and not heard and no one wants to see you,ABU
k of dislikes are the crazy femnists who cant handle facts,NOT
woop great job youre on the right track with fruit eat as much as you possibly want of fruit and keep the rest high carb low fat and if you ever crave something non vegan try to find an alternative theres crazy good veggie burgers lattes chips cakes cookies etc you can find anything you want as vegan ,NOT
remember to keep meals simple eat plenty of carbs and fruits vegan food tends to be lower in calories so you gotta eat until youre satisfied dont be hard on yourself if you slip up just remember why you are doing this think of the animals and remember that your food choices affect them directly good luck ,NOT
she ate chicken today so disappointed,NOT
its no point in deleting this now everyone whos gonna laugh about this downloaded it by now,NOT
what a time to be alive,NOT
i found this video very interesting i know that in class we discussed how the wage gap is  cents to every dollar according to the statistics in the article written by equal means equal however that didnt necessarily specify how these came about for example chrisitna hoff sommers breaks it down in her video there is no wage gap she says that this is just based off the median income of women and men i liked that they used median because this gives an accurate representation of the situation using an average would just mess this certain statistic up however she did bring up a statistic from an organization that is feminist that says the wage gap is only about  cents when all factors are included these factors include things such as what job they have and how many hours they work i liked how she pointed this out and set the record straight on this statistic however after reading the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real by elise gould jessica schieder and kathleen geier the wage gap is looked into further the article has numerous statistics but figure k really stand out to me people always argue that there is a wage gap because of the education level between men and women however this chart showed that even at the same education level men make more than women on average this statistic is very useful because now men and women are in the same level and men still make more than women overall all these sources are helpful i think that there is no doubt a wage gap because there is just so much more evidence to prove there is a wage gap then to prove there isnt one i did find the video interesting because she does have solid claims to back up her point,NOT
trisha you have a vagina you are a woman periodd,NOT
eggroll in a bowl is good,NOT
after watching this video im completely upset with my school they are teaching us that the  cent wage gap is real i thought school was supposed to give u facts not a myth,NOT
people want women to not only work to earn money to support the family but also take over majority of the household work and childcarechild rearing in other words men wants women to be superwomen but dont want them to complain at all sure some men share the household work but according to the stats that is like only a low single digit percent its kinda sad,NOT
check out minimalist baker her recipes most arent baking or sweets are super easy to follow and honestly my faves also whole foods has really great alternatives for dairy and cheese and stuff,NOT
omg that intro was super adorable lol ,NOT
i feel this new vegan movement is going to save lives praise god but many people do not have the option or privilege of following a healthy vegan lifestyle emphasis on healthy until our culture rejects the religion of consumption i dont think veganism can be sustainable or safe for anyone who is not privileged this lifestyle requires us to do our research look for whole food plant sources of many nutrients and monitor our nutrient intake with bloodwork for b among other things and then make the time to relearn how to prepare our own food not everyone has access to the time resources or even cognitive functioning to take on this lifestyle in a healthy way ive only been vegan for a year and half and acknowledge it as a privilege i pray that i do not lose access to healthy whole foods but there is no guarantee,NOT
i give it a day,NOT
i was hoping youd address trish posting her  snap hours after all this mess lol,NOT
its not wages its earnings,NOT
thank god someone knows how to give a compelling argument with factsunlike tyt if they had the same topic it would just be hurrr durrrr gender gap hurrr durrrr equality,NOT
yasss gluten and dairy always makes me breakout,NOT
this will not work out well for the pc crowd,NOT
the wage gap is thrown off balance bc theres a minority of men who become ludicrously rich and a large chunk of men work extremely dangerous and thus well paying jobs,NOT
such a nice explanation,NOT
ah an advertisement i didnt mind viewing in its entirety,NOT
my goodness some people are so dumb i am humiliated i used to eat meat going vegan changed my life for the better and it doesnt hurt to know i am doing the right thing for the planet too go vegans,ABU
the title is just dumb ur looking for controversy at this point,ABU
individuals tend make the same wages for the same jobs regardless of gender who cares about averages they dont matter and the idiot masses dont know how to interpret them now stop lowering my earning potential all youve done is kept us all equally poor just ask around everyone in every business is paid the same crummy wages unless youre a friend of the family who owns the place,NOT
well done trisha on going vegan it will do wonderful things for your body inside and out as aesthetics and health not to mention the environment and will be keeping your new feelings and actions in aline with each other towards animals heres some tips to help you  cronometer  this will help you keep track of your protein carbs fats ratio calorie count and nutrition  dont be afraid to eat eat eat eat people who eat low calorie on vegan diets normally cant stay on it because they cant stay satisfied  wholefoods fruits veggies are youre friends and will improve your health however rapid change in diet ex fibre and things like that can make the body go through a detoxification  be prepared for that  if the veggies fruits gets boring or your craving animalproducts try vegan meats chocolates or vegan restaurants plus there are some amazing vegan youtube recipes all you gotta do is look itll keep your creativity and tastebuds alive  might be best not to go hardcore for your first  weeks but to transition from junk food vegan to health food vegan it will make it easier or at least find the right balance for you  veganism is a progression not a perfection just keep trying and the longer you go the more natural it will become ,NOT
ok weeks is fu king awesome,NOT
im actually surprised about how well made the video is my only question is why is this a problem the results are clearly because of life choices which women make so why do we need to close the wage gap at all,NOT
so its caused by a legitimate disadvantage of having to take on the majority of child rearing that seems reasonable why is there so much vitriol and disbelief does anyone deny that having to care for a child takes effort that could otherwise be used towards a career and that that effort comes mostly from women i believe these statements to be true based on what ive observed and if they are true than it is obvious women have a disadvantage when it comes to having a business career leading to a wage gap it may not be true in your specific field but it is true in a general sense and we should work towards fixing it where we can,NOT
what this means is that the wage gap is voluntary based on sick american female culture women choose a man and they decide how to spend hours so sick male culture gets involved too misogyny and misandry coexist and as a white male i feel demonized far more than i see women exploited since my birth in,NOT
its not about gender its about what job your getting im not getting all defensive but your talking bs men choose higher paying jobs and more working time which leads to higher pay,NOT
i went vegan about a week ago because my body has intense stomach pain when i eat animal products now after growing up on animal products,NOT
to much environment and to much health whre is ethic where is the only real reason to this the animal cruelty but nonetheless good that there is a movie so thank you for that ,NOT
thank you pbn im so proud to be vegan,NOT
gender fluid is what u would be bc one day u feel like a girl and wanna dress up and look sparkly and the next u want to be dressed muscline and man like its not trans its gender fluid or non bionary,NOT
im training to be a pilot a job that earns a lot of money if i get a wife i wont let her use my money on buying things she will have a job and pay for part of the house as will i and shell also pay for anything other than necessities that she wants with her money no joint bank accounts,NOT
this should be broadcasted on television,NOT
today i was having a debate with my teacher and some classmates during english and my teacher and a friend kept going on about the wage gap didnt listen to facts i was this close to walking out,NOT
im not trying to be rude but i dont think youre trans  youre making us trans men look like a fucken joke  we try so hard to be accepted by people  you do this shit smh ,NOT
wait no they earned  less k to k not  unless you mean  the amount that men make,NOT

im so happy to see this if you continue this past  weeks i will be so proud of you going vegan is the best thing ive ever done  hope more people can feel the same way i do  this is a huge step forward,NOT
i dont believe you,NOT
you are a fucking man step the fuck down,ABU
so even female pharmacists still make less than their male counter parts,NOT
i do not eat any animal products for the last  years i have an issue identifying myself as vegan the industry though is better than the meat producing industrythere is a lot of processed vegan foods out therein the bigger picture survival of human species and a healthy life is what we aim forbut the vegan trend and people who follow it are being exploited by those processed food industries,NOT

yay conrats  its great ,NOT
oh i thought this was an ad before the actual video,NOT
i have no clue how this isnt sparking a colossal feminist outrage these  biological males are always going to have a physical advantage over any biological female at least in wrestling there is a reason why girls begin to compete solely against other girls around the time they hit high school if i had a daughter in this situation i would feel she was being robbed a chance at first place,NOT

i as a male actually pay more to renew my license ever year than a woman does solely due to the fact that i am a male this is because there have been more males involved in accidents than females so i pay the higherrisk fees i have yet to see anyone raise a fuss about this,NOT
youre going to be amazing just find vegan versions of anything you love then everything else falls together keep the animals in the forefront of your mind ,NOT
what a queen you are i love this,NOT
dislike because they did a great job dismantling the wage gap then said it still exists it is a minor difference that can be explained by mentality and willingness to negotiate pay not a gap perpetuated by womanhating capitalists just a difference that occurs because of many factors factors almost entirely based on personal choice,NOT
i identify as a social democrat but i think a portion of the wage gap truly is due to other factors besides just sexism like experience time off and other factors a lot will disagree but ive looked at numerous studies i welcome all to do a lot the research yes sexism plays a role somewhat i just think people need to be realistic when it comes to issues like this im not saying this and other issues needs addressed in any way it does im just saying you cant put the blame on any on thing it is due to multiple factors sexism isnt anywhere near the top reason is all im saying debate me if you want but im not arguing and namecalling,NOT
they definitely sound like girls to me sarcasm,NOT
i lost the little respect i had left for you,NOT
you dont have a fucking clue on how just to be a person and yet you think you can put your self in to a community that have truly struggled within them selves you are fucking trash,ABU
is this a joke  good luck if not ,NOT
sorry but i have to point out a mathematical error in this video starting about  seconds in the math is explained as the median earnings of all women working full time divided by the media earnings of all men working full time but then you give an example talking about the average income average and median are not the same thing in fact they can be very different,NOT
nobody fucking cares bitch,ABU
its not a fact you lying bimbo its illegal to pay a woman less  for the same job its a reflection of personal choice how many women want to go into engineering or masters of business management mba or computer programming its going to get worse the more chicks take gender or ethnic studies in college they have no economic worth so good luck ladiesand dont blame anyone but yourselves for your poor life choiceswere not in the mood go make me a sandwich kout,ABU

stay the fuck out of others peoples business jesus christ,ABU
i love this video but why did you give money to chik fil a,NOT
my opinion  troll video for views  gender shouldnt be a big deal like using jonathan van ness  he came out and thats that we shouldnt be shoving things in peoples faces  i am a strong advocate for lgbtq rights and its sad that blaire thinks nonbinarism is a fad   trisha is crazy so we shouldnt be really caring too much about her but rather for trans rights   gender dysphoria i see  she just wants to be masc and fem in her gender expression not identity,ABU
i went pescatarian  i gained so much weight too i do still eat dairy but not anymore than i did before and i try to eat dairy free as much as possible like i have dairy free bread ice cream and cheese etc but ive gained so much weight and im still gaining after  months,NOT

shes definitely coked up in this video,NOT
not a bad video but  less of k is not k  min,NOT
i think its great but it left a bad taste in my mouth because of her saying only two weeks to get ready for a video her main reason is vanity and she was just on there eating steak and bacon and loving chicken skin on her last few videosbut any attention for the cause is a win in my book thank you freelee for all that you do,NOT
she just bought a balenciaga bag,NOT

now i love you even more yaaas mama save the animals,NOT
its a fact that they have an unfair advantage wtf its not maybe its science,NOT
every year i watch the end of year vegan film by you guys and every year i think you cant beat it and guess what every year you prove me wrong this is awesome huge well done and massive thanks for putting these out there ,NOT
there is a theory that states that after accounting for variables even though women still earn less it is likely because they are far less agressive when negotiating wages and asking for raises whereas men tend to be more heavy handed in requesting raises,NOT
im hooked on your intelligence personality and the rest never thought id be a fan of a transgyoure real so rare we love you god bless and keep you safe,NOT
dont have the mindset of i need to surround my meal around the meat,NOT
not sure why you are all hating on her whether shes fully trans or maybe she just feels as though she identifies more as a man shes not about to set herself up for public ridicule for clout as a pan sexual cis woman ive thought about trans before and been curious and confused you should all be at the very least nice to me,NOT
you dont make sense lol,NOT
trans people  terfs agreeing that trish is not trans,NOT
if pharmaceutiaal science is only  male than it is  female than that makes it a female dominated field by ,NOT
well put together inspiring and also sad at times every year needs to be the year for vegans we cant get comfortable because we have vegan option everywhere now we have to push and push till every animal is free and every inch of animal agricultural land is reforested,NOT
omg i love you this is vodka btw bwahahahahah yasss i agree ,NOT
you guys do a fantastic job thank you,NOT
the devisive thing that people put upon these statistics is that the descriptor and defining factor of wage gap is gender which is completely unfounded this video helps denote that there are so many factors that create such gaps they are logical and make total sense just based on the structure of society,NOT
yess ive been waiting on this video,NOT
its pretty simple all sporting event now have to add separate categories for competition well have boys basketball girls basketball transgender girls basketball and transgender boys basketball andyou do this for every sport that way competitors are going against others that are starting from the same biological starting point its ridiculous to have boysmen who identify as girlswomen to be competing against biological girlswomenand vice versa their personal preference as to their self identity sexuality etci could care less its their lifebut when it comes to organized competitionis has no place if you have the dna of a maleyou go compete against other males regardless of how you identify if you have the dna of a women go compete against other women regardless of if you identify as a male unless of course youre taking testosterone what is the point of sportif everyone isnt starting from a level playing field,ABU
this is actually a good explanation thanks vox,NOT
so they have proved that peoples well being are not important families and people who work for a greater good obviously arent worth anything,NOT
was this vid recorded before the mac n cheetos,NOT
sorry but genetically they are male so it is an unfair advantage they are better off competing against other transgender people then it would be fair,ABU
make sure you get enough pretend,NOT
the  cents to a dollar stat is only true if you compare apples to oranges overall if more librarians are women and more men are firefighters that means a man on average will earn more because firefighters tend to earn more but if you compare the wages of men who are firefighters to women who are also firefighters or any other profession the wage gap turns out to be a lot less than  cents to a dollar so it is false to claim women earn  cents to a dollar doing the same work as a man politifact has rated such statements by politicians as false i really wish this video had made this point clearer,NOT
what feminists see is the percentage but people with a sense of logic see the actual implications of the data that provide the percentage women are more likely to choose jobs that pay less and they are more likely to take more time off through maternity leave this results in a lower pay yes not all women choose lower paying jobs and yes not all women get pregnant which impedes their pay but some do which is what changes their pay and by extension the averages that are used to receive the data for the percentage,NOT
i do think the transgender girls are at an advantage however the mom bianca is just bitter that her daughter lost that should encourage her daughter to keep training practicing etc to get better,ABU
so you know its not a pay gap so why do you persist in mischaracterising it as such its an earnings gap plain and simple that is not something to correct it is perfectly correct already,NOT
rights men have that women dont sorry this folder is empty,NOT
potatoes rice and veggies,NOT
you gotta try some vegetables trisha try them cooked  seasoned with other foods you will like some,NOT
men make more money because men care more about making money this isnt rocket science anyone that cant see this must be willfully ignorant men are not more materialistic but they absolutely care more about how much money they make and guess what thats fair the person that cares more and tries harder as a result should do better i know we love this idea of the mary sue characters like ray from star wars no practice no effort just instantly a master of whatever she tries to do thats not real life unfortunately the person that tries the hardest usually wins men care more about making money so they try harder to make money because they try harder guess what every decision that they make will be influenced by the desire to make more money and in the end they will likely out earn women stop trying to prove that women are better than men its crazy annoying and it belies your inferiority complex,NOT
oh wow cant believe theres a video on the wage gap thats fact based kudos,NOT
im the weird guy watching vox at the bus stop,NOT
i tried to show this to my mother whose a pretty hardcore feminist and she refuses to even watch it she called me a misogynistic idiot theyre so dug into their opinion that they dont believe the facts even if theyre right in front of them,NOT
and google a bunch of vegan recipes and foods it helps i havent been a complete vegan ive crashed a couple times but im trying too,NOT
women will always get paid less than men only in their mind,NOT
trisha is the embodiment of rnotlikeothergirls,NOT
you not being girly doesnt make you fucking transgender its called being a tomboy dumbass,ABU
shes trying it again everyone shes two days strong,NOT
thank you this has always been my thinking,NOT
if women got paid  less for the exact same work wouldnt companies only employ women cause itd be cheaper and theyd get the same results,NOT
its no coincedence that the highest paying university degrees with the most men are some of the most sexist fields you could work in this is an incredibly devisive video,NOT
trisha a tip for losing weight is to hear your body and dont overeat eat until you feel satiated because i followed freelees advice and used to stuff myself and gained weight so eat until satiated,NOT

hey trish my whole family is vegan and its soo healthy for you but you have to make sure you eat protein you can make shakes with vegan whole protein and instead of milk you can use almond milk and if you are really craving a hamburger you can buy frozen vegan patties i can say though being vegan is a little pricy im pretty sure joey can help you out too lots of love ,NOT
phillip schofield had some disgusting laugh when eating that animal confirming his evilness can see right through them all,NOT
so they debunked the wage gap then say its real smh,NOT
       ,NOT
the wage gap does exist but its not about women getting paid less its about women choosing jobs that pay less than men do why do women choose lesser paying jobs its not because they need more time to take care of their kids not every woman has a child its because of the way women are raised if you walk into the girls toy section of a store its filled with baby dolls and lots of other toys that are associated with taking care of children and things that are considered feminine other videos about the wage gap will point it out women go into pediactrics over brain surgery all the time im sure theres more but im not aware enough of the job market right now to know if this wasnt a sexist problem then women wouldnt be choosing lesser jobs than men in the first place,NOT
but this is literally how left side people be didnt yall say you can call yourself any gender lmao,NOT
the lack of flexible hours isnt the only reason why women earn less,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same jobs it has nothing to do with discrimination  briliant human being,NOT
are you still going to make mukbangs please do ,NOT

vgtarien sera bien dj,NOT
as a hindu when we were growing up we were never meat focused we were food focused beef was not on the menu so whether its here or not makes no difference to us we fast where its just vegetables    times a week our meat eating is reduced to the  days and its mixed between lamb poultry and fish and that too its always mixed with vegetables what is known as hinduism knows that meat is not really important eat what you enjoy and eat it in moderation but with alot of awareness so you get the satisfaction and proper nutrition this vegan versus carnivores are just too extreme in my opinion we believe in balance of life management of your mind and body this extreminism is dangerous to our world vegans are becoming aggressive and as a result not rallying their cause very well who wants to be an angry vegan neither do i want to be an angry carnivore balance in mind and body,NOT
trans athletics where men get everything and women get consistent beatings its the islam of sports  steven crowder,ABU
what the fuuucccck trisha,ABU
yes there is a wage gap dont market that,NOT
anyone has credible sources about it not denying it on the contrary,NOT
ben shapiro destroy sjw with fact,NOT
absolute shame  the rule should be changed the girls should compete with girls  boys with boys  im a canoe  but i identify as a aircraft carrier soooo yea same thing,ABU
ive always been attracted to gay guys  so maybe im a gay man  ive lost brain cells watching this video,NOT
when it comes down to it it is society tell me this would you want a woman to work as an aerospace engineer or a chemical engineer or any high paying engineer probably no in society its not easy for a woman to get those jobs because of their gender and people tell them women cant do this or cant do that dude we have never even had a woman president women and men are different and men are considered the more hard working gender but there are plenty of hard working women as well and its not about wage gap its more about discrimination,NOT
theres nothing fair about this bullshit unless you dudes are about to turn down your potential medals  let the real galswomen win,ABU
you and discipline are like oil and wateryou wont last a day i am sure,NOT
great video keep it up vox,NOT
in addition trans people typically feel dysmorphia in regard to their genitals trisha literally has a porn website and posts pictures naked,NOT
im so lost,NOT
kalvin garrah where you at,NOT
it would be ironic if the women oops my bad the whole cast of making this were paid just over minimum wage while some rich white jew was raking in stacks as the ceo that would really prove their point,ABU
try working at the same place for  years and having a man make the same amount as you day  same education same position and same company this is the story of my mother she worked in the same factory since she was  its because of unions you know organizations that are supposed to protect workers just not the ones that actually work,NOT
update she failed she just uploaded her eating chicken and waffles on her ig,NOT
bravo to all brave vegans  dont let anyone or anything stop you  because you are fighting for your life  the lives of billions of animals  and the existence civilization ,NOT
this intro is kind of dumb the reason businesses dont only hire women is because  the women will know that they are being paid less than if a man worked there and thats incredibly disrespectful  if a business hired only women men would be absolutely pissed and boycott all of the businesses and they would lose money before watching the whole video i believed in the wage gap now that i have other statistics i dont other than the fact that the information is dated its a good video,NOT
shes mentally ill  i feel bad for her fuck,ABU
i used a one person womans restroom before because i couldnt hold it and a transgender told me i cant use the womans restroom smh wtf,NOT
way to go,NOT
yes thats right  the choice is the difference a woman is expected to take care of children and run the household of course she is not willing to work on call of course she is less willing to move  a man expects from his wife to follow him wherever he find a better job but a woman cant expect her husband to follow her where she finds better job as for the dangerous jobs the reasoning is the same  the woman thinks that she has a duty toward the children and this duty precedes any high salary soooo if and when a man begins take same responsibility toward children and household the gap will disappear but for now,NOT
so its not sexism really running out of issues there feminists,NOT
what are thos two things ,ABU
please watch the video before you disliking,NOT
men are also more likely to ask for raises and work longer shifts,NOT
i heard shes not even vegan anymore and that video she did a while back so confused,NOT
i think you are just gender fluid,NOT
roasted cashews r so good,NOT
been vegan for  years now its amazing to see how popular it has become its inevitable it will continue to spread as people open their eyes and to those people that say they only eat red meat well let them self destruct as their anger grows and their bodies suffer the consequences by the way chances are that sauce on your steak was probably plant based or at very least had more plant based ingredients than animal based ingredients humans can survive and thrive on just plants but ive never meet anyone that has survived on just red meat alone for over  years,NOT
omfg ur being so positive wowmy mind is blown i just can not get over that,NOT
u speak so fast i cant understand u,NOT
i cannot stand trisha paytas she is trashy stupid and vapid shes already given up trying to go vegan and just uploaded an emotional eating video where she stuffed her face with the very food she said she cant even stand to eat anymore after watching slaughter videos shes  fake from the outside in its time to give up on the girl freelee shes a lost cause,ABU
q how you make your hair look so awesome do you have any good shop with wigs,NOT
boycott all fast food restaurants,NOT
just letting you know the grapes are full of sugar  baby carrots are normal carrots shaped to look like baby carrots i dont advise you to go on freelees diet i put on weight with her diet i advise you to always have breakfast maybe start juicing for lunch  protein with  veg for dinner and try not to eat after pm if you get hungry after dinner try eating a couple of dates or date rolls with skim milk for desert or a treat freelees eat large amounts doesnt work,NOT
so basically there is no wage gap but theres an earnings gap which is not caused by inequality or discrimination but rather by the different choices men and women make now can the social justice virtue signallers stop whining about it,NOT
vegan tip put nutritional yeast and spices on like everything it makes it soooo much better and it helps alot at the start,NOT
most of the land in the amazon area are used for grain farming and most of those grains are for human consumption not for cattle veganism is based on fake news not surprised that veganism is growing along with the fake news increase in the recent years,NOT
those two boys should be ashamed not for having gender dysphoria but for using their identity issues as a way to leverage themselves in competition cheating plain and simple,ABU
i identify as a billionaire,NOT
wow not click bait this time am i at the right channel ,NOT
youre fucking gross jesus,ABU
whos gon tell ha ,NOT
u should try barbecue tofu with rice i think its good,NOT
girl you cant just eat fruits and veggies especially in those small portions  i would recommend getting a lot more starchy foods ie potatoes rice pasta bread otherwise you will feel low energy and will crave meat and dairy and all that bad stuff im so proud of you and hope you can keep on this great diet,NOT
never watched your videos before just watched the video on onision and came upon this best reaction ever ive subscribed,NOT
i think gender fluid might be something you should research a bit not saying your current label is wrong or anything just sounds like similar to what you are explaining,NOT
what people miss about the gender wage gap is that it doesnt exist,NOT
this happens when a person is bored and havent had any attention in a long time i thought at her age she would be a bit more educated about lgbtq community,NOT
how incompented can you be,NOT
this video is accurate on every accountexcept when it comes to childrearing the reason why men work longer hours even without prior notice is because they are the ones that more than half the time are responsible for less than half of all child and home related activities and responsibilities sexism does exist and even now women are still expected to take care of more than  of all domestic responsibilities this video implies sexism plays no part whatsoever and fails to factor in who takes care of the children in american households and how much,NOT
that there is none,NOT
women take on a disproportionate share of childrearing tasks including pregnancy,NOT
there is but its just way smaller than  cents,NOT
youre fortunate in living in la because theres plenty of restaurants also theres pretty much a vegan alternatives to most animal products in case you get cravings,NOT
ive never watched her content and her comments made my brain stuttet and reboot,ABU
this is so disrespectful and takes away from all the hard work that real female athletes put into being great not right be a man and compete with people with the same physical capabilities,ABU
if trisha can do it i can do it,NOT
i gained weight when i was a veganvegetarian i was always hungry that food went right through me but not quite because i was also bloated plus my hair thinned out and my skin went to hell i was anemic and hypoglycemic if trish has pcos which many overweight women do all those carbohydrates will make that worse lets just say it doesnt agree with everyone bland and unsatisfying food will just make binge eating and cheating worse freelee rides her bike like crazy yet seems to leave that out when she is talking about her weight loss ,NOT
equal pay act of  look it up,NOT
people are supposed to eat meat that is what the sharp teeth are for but all you vegans and vegetarians you do you boo,NOT
nuts are a great source of protein,NOT
burrito bowls are amazing lots of rice beans lettuce corn ect ,NOT
theres no gender wage gap its an earnings gap wage is the same for men and women they earn less or more if they work less or more hours,NOT
there will come a time in the future where we look back in shame at how we ate and used other animals for our pleasure we will recoil at the violence we sowed upon them for our selfish desires just like all forms of oppression and exploitation that have come before us animal exploitation will end which side of history will you be on when the history books have been written,NOT
feminists but this is wrongbecause of reasons,NOT
my grandad told my mum she could only do a science degree because as a scientist himself he thought that was all that mattered and that it would give her better prospects shes not naturally gifted in sciences and would have enjoyed something like english or philosophy much more as that is what shes good at my mum has a decently paid job now but has low job satisfaction and always says she wishes she had been allowed to follow her passion this is what would have to happen on a societal scale to close the wage gap youre advocating for women to make choices they will regret for the rest of their lives,NOT
this just comes to show how crazily obsessed american are with sports,NOT
in a nutshell its a canadian women vs american man because american dollar canadian dollar,NOT
ok im all for lgbt but this is not fair at all,NOT
great job trish,NOT
science  your feelings,NOT
if that is not meat then it is vegetarian,NOT
good luck trish im really proud of you haha d ok so i have been a vegetarian not vegan but i did try it once for a couple weeks for i think almost  and a half years now and i have never felt better i hardly ever get stomach aches and feel bloated only when i eat a lot of candy or whatever it was honestly such a fantastic idea and there are meat alternatives sold in so many stores like trader joes and such made from plant protein that i eat it is so good for cravings you might have at the very beginning of this life style theres vegan chicken and beef believe it or not some have eggs and dairy but others are completely vegan and you can find vegan foods in organic type grocery stores like sunflower market and stuff like that protein can be found in tofu i recommend tofu for sure in different sauces and stuff with rice even just seasoning  lemon and in nuts nuts are very important lol like almonds get some tubs and stuff of like trail mixnut mix,NOT
does that make sense um no fuck no it does not,NOT
if most women prefer staying home more hours over wasting most of their lives in some company and that makes them happier who am i to judge and to be fair it does seem smarter than some workaholic decisions men make,NOT
they do have a unfair advantage bigger hearts bigger lungs etc,ABU
atleesr shes not a feminist,ABU
we need more people like her,NOT
we have a shop called holand and barents and you can get vegan butter and manny things that are vegan and if you want protein i recommend you getting wheat grass and there are manny things that you can get and by being vegan you will feel more energetic and fit  and there are a lot of vegan thins that you can get from holand and barrats,NOT

you can order any drink from starbucks with soy milk or coconut milk but you have to be careful with starbucks a lot of their drinks have way too much sugar in themfattening what i get from starbucks is an iced coffee with coconut milk no sweetener i had to gradually work up to that because i know its hard to go from sweet drinks to plain drinks,NOT
great film guys gives me great hope for the future,NOT
freelee is a fake,NOT
what the f there is a wage gap i got paid  when my fsb collugue got pain ,NOT
i might just be the only person to not leave a hate comment bc i feel the exact way that you do i just dont identify as trans bc im too scared to confront the feelings fuck yall for being mean if someone feels a certain way theyre allowed to talk about it and identify in a way that feels right to them which is what labels were made for also its just a label and we are all humans trying to figure out wtf is going on in our brains but nah yall just bullies if you have an actual constructive thing to say feel free to reply otherwise dont waste your time bc i dont care and dont want to read dumb ass hate messages,NOT
i wanna support you but i dont believe youyour snapchats always show you at restaurantseating meat,NOT
another seemingly obvious point that gets overlooked all the time is how relationships are formed between men and women call it whatever you will but women usually end up dating and marrying men who earn at least as much as they do often more when you are talking about people in higher earning positions lets say k and it comes time to start a family it is often easier for the woman to take time off work or leave the work force all together when their spouse is making enough money this also has a negative affect on women taking on more work or chasing promotions which comes with more work there is no real incentive to do so when the husband is earning good money the combined income of both people earns themselves a very comfortable life style there simply isnt a need for the woman to earn more next up actually compare two people in the same exact position within an industry chase as many examples of two or more people in identical positions as possible and study the earnings gap,NOT
god damn you do make me laugh i love your videos,NOT
this film had me taking deep breaths full of hope,NOT
thank you for making an important change to stop animal cruelty you have such a beautiful heart for feeling for the animals farm to fridge is what turned me vegan too the stat says that each person living vegan saves  animals a year not counting sea animals my family of three has been vegan for four years so just my little family weve already saved at least  pigs calves cows chickens chicks and fish imagine the many of us who are watching your videos now what a difference it would make when you can live happily and lavishly without harming others you feel so amazing i hope youve watched cowspiracy really cool to know all the other reasons and how youre helping the world forks over knives youll appreciate the health aspects changing inside fat sick and nearly dead the first season is very promising showing how our bodysystems can heal itself of lifelong illnesses if we stop putting toxins in if you have audible must listen to how not to die,NOT

trish you look so gorgeous in this video,NOT
men take more risks so on average they sometimes earn more,NOT
i dont know why they keep pushing for this to be normalized when we know in the future it will always play out like this trans women constantly winning making bio women obsolete in their abilities to compete so what exactly are they trying to advocate for because that sure as hell dont sound like progress,NOT
i see so many comments about how going vegan resulted in weight loss is everyone wanting to lose weight nowadays why not just eat less food,NOT
what happens to a girl caught injecting herself with male hormones she is excluded from the competition well thats the very same thing,NOT
veganism is unhealthy being vegan wont save the world,NOT
i had a stroke watching this ,NOT
and it also doesnt look at age demographics,NOT
not certain why neofeminists feel it is incumbent upon them to lecture the world on the proper division of responsibilities within a relationship there are a myriad of reasons why and how a couple may choose to split their time between work home and family but regardless of the result it remains their decision to render and they typically do so to further the familys advantages not to promote a social agenda if either partner honestly believes they are being taken advantage of it is incumbent upon them to speak with their significant other and attempt to resolve the issue it is not the purview of progressive gender ideologues to resolve those issues for them,NOT
oh no trish no,NOT
i love how they got a women to do this its so much more convincing take that feminists,NOT
honestly as a transman i laughed at her video i was offended at first but now i just laugh at it because its so ridiculous,NOT
bro i got this bring back fair play ad about how biological men are now in women sports smh,ABU
girl go try the veggie grill theyre all over la and the food is bomb af i was obsessed with chicken too and the veggie grill santa fey crispy chicken sandwich got me over it because it tastes exactly like chicken everything at the veggie grill is vegan including their chocolate shakes and cookies im soo happy youre going vegan good luck and like everyone else said be careful not to overeat because a lot of people tend to when going vegan keep in mind that freelee rides her bike for at least  miles every day and thats about  calories burned so she can afford to eat a huge bowl of pasta every night i stick to rice veggies fruit and some beans for weightloss also dont treat fats like the theyre a demon freelee goes a bit overboard with her fat restriction encorporate some avocado nuts or coconut a couple times a week whole foods has the best vegan desserts the whole foods by me has amazing vegan chocolate cupcakes that i def recommend if yours has some i also suggest upping the fruit because it really helps with mental stuff i got out of my depression on a high fruit vegan diet kate flowers on youtube is raw but she has some super tasty recipes like cinnamon rolls only made with fruit so def check her out costco has the cheapest dates which are a must have if youre going vegan sorry for such a lengthy comment im just super stoked love you trish and goodluck ,NOT
that dude with the white bandana runs like hes a goddamn running back for the chicago bears wtf,ABU
rice different types of beans sweet potatoes plenty of veggies and fruits and some good spices  all really help start a vegan diet plus living in la there are a lot of vegan restaurants so take advantage of that ,NOT
i figured it out how to get through to you take out the dangerous jobs nobody wants to do that men do that women dont then add all the job positions men and women do adding them all up to get  and  showing they make the same amount for the same jobs positions next show the dangerous choices of work that men do that women choose not to after you figure out it is the same pay it will show from mens choices of dangerous jobs that it adds up to  for men to who choose dangerous jobs women choose not to do leaving it out of the  equation let the  set off to the side by men choosing to do dangerous jobs women choose not to do by averages of pay do not add this to  because it is choices of work vs pay now wait for it,NOT
if trisha does one of her dramatic cryingonthekitchenfloor responses to this i will be so amused,NOT
and here i am thinking remind me again why freudian psychology discredited again,NOT
you forgot to mention that men are expected to work longer hours so over a day we earn more and were more likely to die at work yay,NOT
if this was girls switching to boysit would be fine,NOT
trishaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa your fucking influence could change so many lives   eat the melon alone for reasons i dont remember its better to eat melon by itself   vegan restaurants in la are caaaaaarrrazzzy as i am sure you know dont restrict yourself   look up vegan recipes on pinterest cookiekate is my fave blog omg im so excited to hear this i really hope it goes well i hope freelee gives you lots of advice,NOT

she should pursue a career as a dominatrix and get back to us in a few months to see how she feels lol,ABU
well i dont wear makeup on a regular basis i guess that i identify as a male now,NOT
awesome thank you for trying and being open minded that is awesome even if you dont stay vegan at least you are spreading awareness vegans arent nazis crazy or unhealthy regardless of what people say you will mentally and physically feel amazing just dont give up its the best thing you can do for the environment factory farming is more harmful than using fossil fuels best thing you can do for the animals and best thing you can do for yourself vegans are the only dietary group in america that fits into a healthy bmi,NOT

yayyyyy i love that youre going vegan love love love ,NOT
women are clustered in lowpaying jobs or traditionally womens work is underpaid teachers caretakers,NOT
i was surprised to see a similar discussion with this video happening in japanit seems that there are people who like propaganda not a sober discussion in any country a politician who tried to make a cool argument would be crushed by the media it would happen in any country,NOT
they  have an unfair advantage against actual girls boys and men are more adept as a group at athletics its irrefutable they were to slow to win in mens track so they had to switch to girls track to win absolutely disgusting,ABU
how about instead of male and female you have different wieht classes kinda like wwf or ufc wrestling,NOT
hey trish  i never thought i could go vegan  but i have and i have some tips  dont be too restrictive  let yourself have vegan treats sometimes eat big meals of tasty veggies and rice and potatoes and stuff like that  dont let yourself go hungry cause then youll super crave dairy and meat and stuff  and if you mess up dont throw in the towel  some effort is always better than none  ,NOT

talk about grasping at straws trisha just needs to go back to her other life style where she belongs because this isnt it shes a hot mess that like i said just needs to go shes disgusting with this,ABU
to be honest it depends some firms are in fact being sexist and paying men more than women but in the general  cents idea that some people have what she says in the video is largely true although i dont think gender matters in whos willing to work more because i believe in equal opportunities since gender equality cannot and shouldnt be achieved i think men and women are human and they both can do the same things depends on how much work they put into it,NOT
what the fuck america,NOT
when you said dumb at  and then that little eye twitch omfg when i tell you i hollered,NOT
vegan is bullshit but the consumption of vegetables has to be way more than meat but much more vegetables in your diet,NOT
basing on how ridiculous lgbt rules are considering genders trisha should be just fine thought you arent about discriminating,NOT
if you live in la there are a million vegan places you could go to if you get stuck on what to eat nuts are a good source of protein so are mushrooms and just about any coffee place can make you your normal order just with soy or almond milk good luck,NOT
i feel like feminist are always mad wage gap or no they will be mad there is none,NOT

going vegan doesnt mean your going to look more beautiful trisha your beautiful the way you are but you can try but i dont think you will be a vegan for a while,NOT
dont forget that in america there is no paid maternity leave and that will prove all feminists wrong,NOT
fires are worse and hotter mainly because of the chemtrailsdropping bromine and aluminum  and a rd main ingredient that is exactly like a sparkler look it up,NOT
woah a balanced pov how refreshing,NOT

trisha no just nooo youre give the lgbt community a bad name,NOT
why are yall being rude,NOT
this is nasty,NOT
look like you have a fat lip on the side,NOT
people are being like shes gonna mess up watch and shit like that but thats okay to make a few mistakes i mean when i first went vegan i screwed up a few times and i felt like shit afterwards lol but now ive been vegan for  years and i first started when i was  c now im  and vegan for life  so dont be like she aint gonna last cause you never know seeing new her attitute i think she will stay vegan,NOT

ive tried beyond meat before its pretty good though i wouldnt eat all the time mainly cause i dont like the taste of beef the after taste of beef puts me off i also dont like the taste of dairy makes me want barf and the smell of it  i had no problem giving them up and it was easy since i never liked them in the first place lol,NOT
the wage gap is not real so brute efforts to close the wage gap will probably only lead to more inequality,NOT
make sure you workout though over eating even a on a vegan diet will make u gain weight happened to me because i listened to freelee,NOT
lots of smoothies vanilla almond milk is also very great i personally dont like tofu but a tofu stir fry is amazing with some peppers carrots and broccoli also as a yummy snack they have a ton of vegan chip options at whole foods  hope this helps,NOT
really people  this is trish she trolls we all know shes straight shes just bull shitting,ABU
you maam are a godsend,NOT
the amount of times i had to pause and just process what she said,NOT
ohmygod im so sick of that waste of life she reminds me of that one swedish broad who changed her race and started injecting something to make her skin darker martina big i believe her name is they both have that wide eyed empty brain look they make pointless and stupid videos thank you for speaking up and blasting this confused and dizzy person from another planet lol love you blaire,NOT
the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,NOT
i make k a year self employed my wife makes k self employed am i contributing to the wage gap,NOT
there is a question of college schlolarships top runners qualifying for regional and state competitions etc there will always be resentment as long as transgender girls come out on top in competitions if hormone therapy really levels the playing field why arent we hearing about women who were once men winning competitions in mens sports,NOT
watch more high carb low fat hclf what i eat in a days,NOT
were asking those who have demonstrated less aptitude for math to understand how the wage gap has been disproven,NOT
anderson cooper is my gay husband ,NOT
i like how the first sentence is just logic,NOT
so they should compare men who take on the majority of house hold and child responsibilities and women to compare to see how that sizes up because this seems to be much more of a cultural structure thing than an actual pay thing,NOT
milli vanilli i miss your music ,NOT
it is completely unfair,ABU
trista trying to stay relevant part ,NOT
how are they brave,NOT
lets talk about the college education gap women make  cents to the dollar of every man well for every  men that are accepted to college  women are in  and this discrepancy is specifically present at the higher ranked schools its a logical fallacy called the double standard critical thinking and taking a look at the whole picture is gravely neglected in this video just my two cents,NOT
so is like a video you just made or is this old like are you now going vegan or did you try to go vegan and failed,NOT
 this isnt sexism its just common sense feminists and libtards get kod once again,NOT
there is no gender wage gap,NOT
what happened to freelees instagram,NOT
im  year old and just  month as a vegan im very happy with the results its time for a big change because our planet and the humanity is severely ill by the way it is not easy to be different and the bullying is terrible but i want to keep on my way to promote the vegan movement thanks a lot for this valuable information,NOT
i was waiting on blaire to drag this video across the kitchen floor ,NOT
seek therapy hoe,ABU
just goes to show you that if feminists had their way women would be getting paid more money for less work than men,NOT
if you look at the  richest people in the world there are all men why because they are actually doing stuff to make money they arent trying to euthanize all guys because apparently if only women were on earth everything would be equalutopian the truth is backed up by many biologists women tend to want to take care of the childrenand they tend to want more time off because a guy works harder then a women does not mean he earns more than women stop taking bullshit theories about how you guys think the world should be and stop making  minute long explanations about them that tell you nothing other than there were studies done to show xy and z truth is researchers often cut corners when they need to get work done so they didnt take the time to pull out all the data necessary to tell you the truth they made an average salary means that more men went into those jobs out of the gate for reasons only those business men and women know about simple fact is the wage gap is bullshit because its a cherry picked problem made up by leftists to try to make the world better when its not possible to make it better than it already is in america side note if a women thinks she is getting paid less there are courts to sue the company for to get equal pay its not that employers are paying you less its that your paying yourself less women,NOT
she just posted a snapchat of her eating chicken and waffles so that lasted,NOT
the only reaction videos i watch are blaires,NOT
being trans wont make much difference colored girls tend to out run white girls,NOT
one of the greatest thing i heard recently about the wage gap was that a spend gap should be introduced when you look at how much the two genders earn and how much they spend everything miraculously evens out lmao,NOT
her views went from  thousand to millions yeah i wonder lol and then charles marlowe is like omg great idea and he does literally the same thing as his response ,NOT
every person with an iq higher than  gives facts on a topic leftist looks like you triggered my victim card,NOT
you can eat all you care for on a hclf vegan diet  i have lost lbs,NOT
vegan food sucks,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense my new favorie quote,NOT
veganism is not a  week crash diet its a lifestyle,NOT
ofc shes not a he lmao this is great,NOT
you can see a compelling argument on both sides side a i feel l am something that i am not so you should recognize my feelings even if it gives me an unfair advantage over people who identify as what they actually are side b opens introduction to biology im going to start identifying as a paraplegic so i can get a good parking space a veteran so i can get discounts and poor so i can collect welfare if you disagree you are clearly a bigoted racist somethingphobic doo doo head,ABU
okay but if anyone ever actually was nonbinary itd be jonathan lets be real,NOT
when comparing a male and female nurse yes the male nurse is paid  more this is because the male has more qualifications the reason male nurses gravitate to the best paying nursing specialties work longer hours and find jobs in cities with the highest compensation aka the willing to relocate career choices and educational differences explain most if not all the gender gap in nursing,NOT
so your pretty much saying the wage gap exists becuse females tend to be less flexible becuse they have to take care of the family more often,NOT
nobody trish im a gay man,NOT
alright i can accept a lot of what is being said here one thing though with all of these discrepancies being shown how come they are rarely if ever acknowledged by the feminist community it seems rather manipulative i would be much more apt to listen in depth about what they are saying if they would actually disclose all information instead of nitpicking and im sure im not the only one,NOT
this video was filmed over a month ago shes wearing the same dress  makeup that she wore to the internet famous premiere cause its the same day she is definitely not still vegan shes eaten eggs chicken and bacon on her snapchat since the video was filmed,NOT
listen mate while the wage gap might not be  cents to the dollar which is actually the stats for white women only women of color earn even less it is still real there have been countless studies by universities such as harvard and oxford that show that for almost identical jobs for people in similar situations women are paid significantly less businesses dont hire all women because studies show that business owners tend to prefer male workers even if the woman is just as qualified or even better if you guys want to believe this its because youve believed it all along and like hearing your opinion voiced with facts which in itself is fine because everyone does but the thing is that facts are not things to be believed they are things to be understood this woman obviously has done well enough or is ignorant enough to not have experienced the need for feminism but that doesnt mean we disregard facts her presentation is obviously meant to be persuasive not informative which of course effects how the whole thing should be viewed im not trying to start anything and if you want to stick to your opinions fine but dont spew this out as fact because it has statistical evidence because that hurts the livelihoods of most working women,NOT
i just googled fair oak farm and i cried what kind of monsters do such cruel things to the baby animals sooo cruel,NOT
wth freezer you did it so proud man im crying omg,NOT
its all about baby steps and im so proud of you for doing something to better yourself and you have to take small steps to stay vegan and not get off track but yes you definitely need more foods more greens more beans and grains etc another thing you should push your viewers to watch those slaughterhouse videos because it does really show you exactly what happens and makes everyone who sees them understand how horrible the reality of the situation is and it could make everyone change their views just like it did for you again i am so proud of you trish for doing this,NOT
people just dont like women thats why not because it costs less also you cant just hire men or just women,NOT
yeah because they are dudes,ABU
imagine taking trisha seriously,NOT
the only legitimate sexism that i see towards women is that more often than not mothers are expected to sacrifice much more time for their child even if they make simpler amounts of or more money than their husband its not always the case but it happens a lot,NOT
do us a favor trysha and blast that pathetic excuse of a face with a good old shotgun how can someone be atracted to that wall paint covered plastic bowl,ABU
you need b vitamins or you can get very sick and you need like proteins hakes,NOT
she is the stupidest most offensive and ignorant ugly ass bitch,ABU
bruh i get crushes on straight girls all the time and thats okay what isnt okay is trying to force myself upon them or intentionally making them question their sexuality and confusing them orliterally transitioning to a male so i can get straight girl coochie i dont do any of that by the way because i know about boundaries and accepting when someone isnt interested,NOT
finally someone who shuts up feminists crying about patriarchy with researched facts love you vox,NOT
check out vegan gainss video for you he gives you some tips for weight lossveganismhealthsustainability,NOT
trisha is making fun of yall maybe not give her any attention which is clearly what she is going for i see her as some bible thumping troll that tries to mock you all and laughing about it at her church pot luck love you blaire,ABU
so excited for you i did it and never went back fruit didnt satisfy me enough so i had black beans with organic corn chips i also eat hummus hummus is amazing smoothie bowls are soon tasty i have grapefruit for breakfast and a smoothie,NOT
everything you just said sounds like internalized misogyny,NOT
remember to eat carbs like rice potatoes etc  not just fruit,NOT
what people realize about the gender wage gap it doesnt exist,NOT
the reason women do almost all of the work of looking after babies is that feminists have brainwashed the world to believe that men are incapable of nurturing and gentleness you wont entertain the possibility that a man has any good characteristics or else feminism would collapse in an instant the other thing feminists refuse to consider is the first thing any man ever does with his pay whenever he gets it he hands it straight to his wife,NOT
shes trolling for clicks,NOT
for breakfast i love to do my chocolate banana smoothie all you do is basically freeze some bananas as much as you want one night before and put some oats in it some cocoa powder raw almond milk honey for it to be more sweet the oats help you to feel so full and you get a lot of energy for the day hope this helps,NOT
they always state  cents per dollar leading everyone to assume that its an hourly calculation they never say that its an annual amount and not hourly the reality of the situation is that for a multitude of various reasons women work less hours on average annually than men thats not an opinion or an assumption thats the pure raw data,NOT
wondering if they have an unfair advantage,NOT
trish protein is not the important thing,NOT
why am i still subbed to you,NOT
heard that djokovic is no longer vegan true,NOT
everything good with everything except for greta thunberg that kid is an annoying teenager and that doesnt give her the reason and why you dont mention bolivia in the burning of amazon,NOT
does anyone have any videos that try to scientifically try to break down wether or not transgenders have an advantage,NOT
your so pretty i omg,NOT
i think shes trolling or shes on drugs,ABU
almost a year vegetarian  almost a week vegan,NOT
if you do that for weight loss issues exercise too and do not starve yourself,NOT
wow im so proud of you trish,NOT
men make more money than women on average but thats only because the very top successful men have enough money to cover up the unsuccessful men the overwhelming majority of the homeless population are men the overwhelming majority of plumbers landscapers garbage truck drivers mailmen and construction workers low paying jobs are almost all male dominated women actually occupy most of the median jobs in society and yes a big reason for the wage gap is that men ask for raises more than women but if you look at the statistics men are significantly fired more than women because they take those risks additionaly there is biology to consider successful men will almost always have options to female partners while unsuccessful men will have much less females do not need to be successful or accomplished to be desired by men so there is less of a demand for it just because the numbers arent the same doesnt mean there is a great injustice being perpetuated by a grand evil superpower think with your brain not your heart,NOT
the fact that women are more carrying with children is obvious  women have to stay with kids home while the man goes to work since that happens men gain up to  more income bcs they can adapt to the working schedule  women  better parent  men  better worker a quick summary of the video,ABU
all of you are a mockery,NOT
everybody who works good get paid good,NOT
drinking vodka through a strawb kudos girl ill take trisha seriously when there is actual proof of bigfoot,NOT
blaire dear those are not ugly faces they are your genuine facial expressions and they are very cute please dont be so insecure about them,NOT

theyre  full grown men in dreads running their ass off yes its an unfair advantage clearly,ABU
milton friedman put it best when governments mandate equal pay laws you make it free for the chauvinists to discriminate a system in which there is no mandated equal pay there is a very visible cost to be discriminatory so how might we best address the gender wage gap if it exists let the chauvinists feel the pain in their pocket books certainly dont make it free for them to be nasty asses,NOT
wtf did i just watch,NOT
trans people should have their own gender category problem solved,ABU
i am so proud of you trisha,NOT

this is just impressive,NOT
okey  the newest statistic is  years old  if women do more work with the kids on average when men do more hours work in work place on average im happy to see how women like if swap those around  if individual gets more work done with same qualifications in the same time as another do you pay them the same although their worth different amounts of work and if or if not why thats just the start of the problems within this propaganda i would gladly discuss this further,NOT
the swedish goverment is also spreading this lie,NOT
the wage gap and the glass ceiling are not real,NOT
trisha i am so proud of you please stick with it because you will feel amazing i was vegetarian for  years and after turned vegan  ive been vegan for almost a year,NOT
the worlds gone fucking mad,NOT
yasssss ive been waiting lol,NOT
the gape doesnt exist because studies have shown that many more men go into higher paying jobs and women will not usually make the choice to work later hours according many studies and when men stay longer they get promoted faster and that earns more money so the gender wage doesnt exist,NOT
why she says about gender norms not being related to gender is so true im a mtf transgender and i wear makeup black lipstick and eyeshadow cause im goth and if i see a dress thats goth ill wear it but i dont identify as a female im just a more feminine male,NOT
they had to get a woman out here because when ever a man explains this women dont want to agree to the facts,NOT
from what trisha is describing i would say that she is actually gender fluid,NOT
if you ask me this is a attack on women,ABU
cotton candy grapes are my favourite i also love nice creams,NOT
trisha is not vegan,NOT
buy this recipe book called vegan junk food it has really good recipes,NOT
so they dont feel that they are dominating the women because they were men how is this fair,ABU

back then we would have just killed people like this,ABU
smoothies and hemp seeds are good  u,NOT
this brings about a point that women feel pressured to not presue further education and education in the higher paying jobs does this raise a point that there is a problem with how we raise children and what paths they are guided down,NOT
dont forget carbs from rice beans get your greens love you so much,NOT
if u got sweet thoot eat dates,NOT
dont know why anyone cares if plant milks can be called milk or not in germany theyre called plant drinks but everyone calls them milk anyway and theyre already so well established in the rest of the world that everyone will just keep calling it milk too no matter whats on the packaging,NOT
this guy needs to go to the slaughter farms and see with his eyes and hear the pain how his animals meats suffered before get to his plate he probably will change the opinion of vegan food,NOT
omg thats amazing trish congrats i hope you stick with it after two weeks,NOT
i had to unsubscribe a while ago because of how she shows the animals were killed and what not  dont get me wrong im vegan the only animal product i use is probably bees wax  i dont use anything else i know its just the way it is  how the animals are killed its sad,NOT
freelee will you do a video about emily skye she is also an aussie very famous on social media and recently on a magazine she recommends a diet of mostly chicken and steamed vegetables though and says that she has a very sensitive tummy maybe raw till  will help her digestion she is already fit looking and very sweet but i think she is a huge influence on many girls and the whole white chicken is healthy myth is just being reaffirmed thanks,NOT
i had to unsubscribe i think not eating animals and dairy is great but i think freelee is a terrible person i think some of these motives are unpure,ABU

so shes a gender fluid bipansexual,NOT
look women have fought hard to have their place in sports and still are but its a difficult topic of is it fair to either group to me in strength and stamina women are at their own level and men have theirs however with these transgender students its difficult to know where their strengths place above or below the girls team a possible solution could be to make a group for transgender athletes one solution im against taking those transgender students completely out of sports because its not fair everyone has a right to partake in something that makes them happy its like with the first woman who ran in the boston marathon and she did it no man could stop her and no one should stop these kids from running i see the girls standpoint of fairness and i also see the transgirls standpoint of inclusiveness within the sport,NOT
just because youre more attracted to gay men doesnt mean youre a guy it doesnt work like that honey that just means your more attracted to feminine guys,NOT
im so confused as to why youre talking about this if youre supporting chickfila,NOT
the one prageru video i like,NOT
im the dumbest person alive and even i know the only solution is a female  male transgender division problem solved anything else is cheating,NOT
i am so proud of you,NOT
how sad this is boys becoming girls and girls dreaming to become boys  its just so fucking sad,ABU
gender is determined by biologybigger bones larger muscles chemicals in the brain are different than females you cannot escape that,ABU
never made mention that men typically work more and longer hours thus increasing pay also that men are more likely to go for higher pay in riskier jobs like mining and oil drilling,NOT
a lot of people in the comments seem to be missing two things  just because something is illegal doesnt mean it cant happen  what job we end up in is a result of lots of factors not all of which are under our control its not just about choice,NOT
i was on a butch and femme internet forum many femme lesbians claimed that they are transgender i wondered why they told me that gender means the social role of a woman or a man and they have a diffrent gender role as a woman they live not the ecpierience of a heterosexual woman thats why they live a diffrent gender as a woman thats why they see themself as transgender i can not describe it as well as they did  but i think i described the reason as good as i understood what they told me well the opinions diverge for me i am trans i can not agree with those femmes but i am also male as well as female not on body but on my inner being i transform between the two,NOT
based mom back at it again,NOT
how come they never provide examples of men and women working for the same company doing the same work and for the same amount of hours being paid differently,NOT
can we maybe say that she is gender fluid  and used the wrong terminology,NOT
all of ur hard work is finally paid off go frelee,NOT
honey its called fucking gender fluid you aint making a revelation,NOT
sooo glad youre trying veganism out  make sure youre not only eating fruit even tho its natural sugar  its still sugar  you can get pretty much a vegan version of anything  even junk food  and being vegan isnt restrictive at all  you live in a city with endless vegan restraunts and stores so this should be easy ,NOT
though this person is obviously an imbecile i do believe i could challenge you in debate regarding the question as to whether being okay with your born sex disqualifies one from identifying as the other being trans is a different category of discernment but i am an example of the aforementioned consideration being not only possible but extant,ABU
well if women worked harder and worked to their full potential then they would earn more,NOT
im a gay man ,NOT
i feel sorry for the girls who train for this and get beat buy a guys,ABU

imagine out clowning pennywise lmao honestly trish i expected so much better from you you lose not only a subscriber but a genuine fan transgaydragetc isnt a choice its something youre born as and find out later on in life the fact that you actually think that because you dont wear makeup you have a masculine personality you go after gay guys makes you a trans man is honestly so disrespectful please realize you need help and get it youre  years old so please act like it,NOT
ohhhhhh the title  ,NOT
imagine being so privileged you have to create obstacles for yourself to feel oppressed,NOT
your argument is based on raising children and that those children are raised by a women not sure we as a society should be okay with that conclusion,NOT
beyond meat burgers are greasy and unhealthy i had one and it made me feel sick if were replacing meat with something thats so highly processed and unhealthy were not getting anywhere we need people to embrace a whole food plant based diet we need to make them feel better healthier happier beyond meat is just an opportunistic enterprise getting rich by riding the wave of this new trend they dont bring any value to the people i bet that in the future all this new type of junk food will be classified as unhealthy educate the people make them fell better and healthier and they will stop eating animals on their own accord i really hate these vegan movements trying to shame everyone who doesnt adhere to their principles we really dont need a new global national socialist party,NOT
oh my gosh we have the same looking cat is your cat named angela or angelo if its a girl thats cool because i was told tabbys are usually boys like mine,NOT
are you going to film your experience like vegan diaries or vlogging,NOT
so basically women get less money because of the jobs they have so a man and woman could get the same exact money for the same job and thats what women are getting mad about im just a noob on this topic so feel free to comment whether im right or not,NOT
wait this pargeru video has evidence fats and sound logic if more of their videos were like this i would actually take them seriously,NOT
watch those videos its so important that we all know how these animals are treated how the suffer and die violently and terrified we need to open our eyes and change i dont believe that anyone whether you love animals or not could watch such violence and thinks its ok to continue to eat animals please the animals deserve so much better,NOT
muscles glistening in the wind lololol love it,NOT
 of stay at home parents are women,NOT
how are yall getting mad about this this makes perfect sense how can anyone possibly say otherwise he is just a gay man who is also drag queen someone please explain to me why they think he is a woman and how they can go to sleep at night for misgendering him on a massive scale,NOT
lol you should be running against dudes if your a dude period just cause you wanna be a chick dont mean your a chick,ABU
while i do think shes joking i think its harmful because she has such a big following and bc shes the first or second video to pop up when you type transgender if shes going to mock a struggle and make some impressionable cis people think theyre trans she should take into consideration how many people will see it and will believe it i dont think she even realizes how many people will see that video and itll be the deciding factor for them to transition and then detransition because they done goofed,NOT
well its about damn time,NOT
you cannot eat too much on a vegan diet listen to your body eat when youre hungry,NOT
its not just about food,NOT
yas girl yaaas im so proud of you hopefully youll continue after  weeks just remember on a vegan diet if youre hungry do be scared to eat just eat till youre full no matter the calories good luck trish love you ,NOT
ok if youre trying to go vegan and you like buffalo wings try eating buffalo cauliflower just bake some cauliflower in the oven and put some vegetarian buffalo sauce on it  i recommend franks red hot buffalo sauce   love you hope you use this recipe and i am very proud of my mama fish for going vegan,NOT
i identify as a robot  or at least a cyborg,NOT

joey can tell you all about the dairy portion he is totally against milk,NOT
so linda aiken explanation of the gap wasnt an explanation it was a just a restate other than that great video i subscribed after watching a couple,NOT
 music about animals welcome to the future for all,NOT
 times now ive seen the newest mcdonalds ad and you know mcdonalds is out of ideas for their happy meals when you hear a kid say i got the lamp,NOT
this video makes the assumption that women being stay at home mums is going to continue to be the norm and that work hours should work around them how about we change this norm which inherently chooses to oppresses women maybe that should be a message of the video continued increase in women not staying at home to take care of kids and less kids all together,NOT
shes describing more of a gender fluid or a non binary person i dont know if what she was saying in her video describes a transgender male or female i think she has her identitys mixed up she shouldve done more research before she posted a video trying to express and describe what label she thinks she falls under she still has learning and figuring out to do she needs to take time away from youtube to find herself,NOT
i miss the rick mirandas outro,NOT
kinda makes sense with how starting a family works a man comes and goes back to work women must wait m,NOT
vox just triggered many angry feminist,NOT
im trans and this video is literally nauceating fuck you for making us look like fools this is so disgusting and offensive,ABU
so proud omg i wish you the best with this beautiful diet,NOT
dude looks like a lady,ABU
now try to get explain this to a feminazi,NOT
must have got sick of freelee being a bitch,ABU
i give the pig  days with it,ABU
youre talking about personality traits not being transgender,NOT
little do people know that plants are technically alive too so were all murderers but anyway gg i guess,NOT
how is this an issue in the first place lol,NOT
why do people still even have to make this video,NOT
i am woke,NOT
i need a safe place from the lgtb community and their supporters girls stop competing when a trans is on the blocks,ABU
good video but the focus on well paying jobs misses the low paid occupations where discrepancies can mean real hardship especially in single parent households,NOT
its not like my dad has had a really hard time finding a job since he stopped teaching and my mom works her ass off to support us my mom works an  to  job common in nb and she doesnt take as many vacations as a lot of other women plus she misses a lot of events me and my brother are involved in because of work which used to often take her across the province for a week or two does she get payed as much as a man who works the same hours holds the same position and takes as many vacations yes she does,NOT
let me show use feminist tactics to turn this around it is so unfair that women get to spend more time taking care of and influencing the small minds of the children while the man has to work disproportionally longer and offer hours at work only to bring more money home that is spent on the family there is a working and family time gape in this country and we need to stop it lolwut,NOT
shes gonna make it like  hours until she drives past a tacobell,NOT
atleast in sweden the real wage gap just taking gender discrimination in to account is about   which is bad but not the  wich many sjvs say,NOT
tldr there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap meaning all men put together earn more than all women put together which is because men work higher paying jobs more dangerous jobs and more hours for the same exact work and same exact hours men and women are paid the same,NOT
getting there vox,NOT
if there are  genders what wage gap are we talking about,NOT
ladies take it from a man you aint breaking a glass ceiling youre breaking a glass coffin youre bringing yourselves down into the shitty jobs stay up there if you value your sanitation,NOT
in the end we all eat shit fear porn imo,NOT
hey good morning america air this video instead you propaganda peddlers,NOT
trust you can eat tofu for protein and you can season it with anything,NOT

you cantbe a gay manjust cuz you have liked a gay man,NOT
i heard sjws get triggered by chik fil a,NOT
 well a quarter isnt much so i can see why they dont hire all women,NOT
im deceased  fucking dead,NOT
there is still a wage gap for like to like jobs but based on job choice a marginal    still exists between male and female but i do take umbrage at men working harder and longer as a nurse and i do not think men are more dedicated or intelligible than women my wife and i receive old age pensions but i get more than her so even the government pays less to females all in all i have my skills and my wife has hers but she gets a work pension higher than mine i was a electro mechanical engineer and she a telephonist you can not average wages out as stated in this video all circumstances differ for each person i believe women are still behind in the pay structure,NOT
yaaaaaas trish this is amazing all vegans are there for u and will help you to become a full vegan hopefully,NOT
you can do it trish,NOT
 i genuinely cant believe this,NOT
also trisha do dogs have brains,NOT
ooohhh merch looks good,NOT
did i really just hear freelee the banana girl say everything happens for a reason hmm,NOT
do it for life ,NOT
honestly i dont think shes trans but she definitely is going through some sort of identity crisis abd i think shes trying to figure out whats going on in her head which is fine to do but she should not be public about it without knowing for sure if shes trans or not and all of her wild ideas of herself she just shouldnt be so open abiut that stuff on the internet bc is can hurt her and others,NOT
you go trishfinally hopped on the vegan lifestyle diet best of luck,NOT
smoothies with fruits veggies hemp seeds and chia seeds its full of protein and soooo easy no cooking spinach carrot frozen blue berries strawberries bananas hemp seeds and chia seeds,NOT
my th year  just gets better even at ,NOT
vegan since october  vegetarian since june   years total i cant believe it because i use to be that person poking fun at vegetarians and vegans im so glad i went vegan and havent looked back,NOT
 minutes in nothing scientific has been stated its been a mix of fear mongering and showing off the financial gains of the people this film is an advertisement for im done you guys didnt make a documentary you made a commerical,NOT
nice to see that they put in the effort to do some real research instead of pushing rd wave feminist rhetoric ill be honest i cringed when i saw the title,NOT
stop feeding this bullshit not transgender girls they are men,ABU
theyre also not good enough to compete with real men,NOT
its actually because im mourning the death of my last  brain cells ,NOT
b a s e d m o m a s e d m o m,NOT
what i want is a study done on is the like to dislike gap actually dont bother,NOT
i stopped eating meat a year and a half ago and it was hard at first but now i cant even smell meat it grosses me out lol im vegetarian though,NOT
freelee we really need ur help on kendalljones last picture,NOT
women do it to their self i can tell just by going to college for several of years in the software programming and tech classes women are nearly non existent while software development is one of the highest paying jobs out there most classes will average like  women out of a  people filled class room and thats even considering that more women are actually in the tech field compared to  years ago the most women ive had in one of my classes was  but even that was a database class that can branch from a general business degree go even into health care and majority of women youll hear are going to be a nurse i dont know if its insecurities or what but i dont think people can blame wage gap when it seems most are purposely going for lower paying jobs instead of trying to become a doctor,NOT
honestly this is a lose lose situation if you say they cant compete people will be called a homophobe but if you let them compete every girl in the race will call them cheaters good luck to those whos going to make that decision cause whoever it is will potentially get buried,NOT
all the extreme feminists had a weak father in their home or didnt have at all,NOT
trisha just wants views we know this by now,NOT
pasta rice beans potatoes,NOT
i feel like there is a natural inclination for woman to take care of kids more than men when you look in nature its typically the females that look after the new borns i know humans are different than birds but its interesting,NOT
dumb ass people men competing against women really is wrong sorry,ABU
has trisha been crucified there is a line along the top of the forehead  not trans anything for trisha,NOT
there is no wage gap there is actually a pay gap,NOT
good job as always christina,NOT
i think that at this point point people arent and shouldnt be offended by what you say i genuinely think you are confused because half of the shit you say is contradicting and on top of that you dont bother to inform or educate yourself on anything you speak about so half of the things said are ignorant or wrong information,NOT
lol she lasted  days only,NOT
congrats you just lost a subscriber,NOT
well that turned pretty quick as soon as a few astute folks did some  minute research into the  cents on the dollar argument and found it to be a fallacy in correlation its now flipped to women make choices to work lower paying jobs in general than men because society pressures them to do so well from what ive seen the last ten years there are so many entities from advocacy organizations to notable individuals encouraging women to pursue higher paying jobs and work more like men do that even that argument is becoming ridiculous how about we allow folks to do what they want see them as individuals instead of lumping them into interest groups and see if our society starts acting rationally for once,NOT
cant tell if this is blatantly disrespectful and offensive for views or if this is just a bad trolloo,NOT
im pretty sure you guys have already made a video on the wage gap why another one,NOT
wonder what gigi will think of this,NOT
these pieces are always the same concentrating on high earning high qualification jobs earnings for the average joe or josephine in the usa is what around k to k per year,NOT
wow you are the biggest piece of shit you are doing this for views to get a paycheck there are people who are actually dealing with these issues and concerns that you are pretty much disregarding your a horrible person,ABU
spectacular now off to paruse the comments section and laugh at offended feminists,ABU
beans legumes nuts chick peas add them to everything they are packed with nutrients not just protein and they are amazing also use the oh she glows recipe book and thug kitchen they are amazing you can do it and honestly if you find great recipes you will find that its actually so easy  good luck girl,NOT
im confused i thought you were a chicken nugget,NOT
there is solid evidence wage gaps between men and women exist i wrote a thesis for school on it,NOT
what an annoying voice every sentence ends in a cracking sound,NOT
wait wait wait waiti thought it was because society hates women and men conspire to keep women out of high paying jobs are you implying that feminists have been less than honest with me about this stat,NOT
the  boys winning this race should be enough proof you cant have trans competing with organic girls,ABU
annnnnnnd there goes my last braincell,NOT
i didnt get a single fucking thing she was saying just me ok,NOT
this is absolute insanity,NOT
i dont believe this one bit this is just another video to get views and likes dont u all see that all she wants is to rake in that yt money sheesh,NOT
this is actually pathetic,NOT
does anyone know what their times were,NOT
no just no identify as a women fine your choice but now youre forcing everyone to not only tolerate the genetic lie but actually feed the lie it allows her to be she wants to be i want to fly like a plane i cant cause i wasnt born a plane i can still say im a plane i guess ,NOT
im still not vegan and not going to be vegan and still dont give a fuck about going vegan love meat always have always will bye,NOT
its simple isn t america you  are  biologically  a  fucking  male so youcannot compete  in womens event,ABU
im appalled you chose this title,NOT
solution move to sweden,NOT
where is septic tank service technician on the chart,NOT
make sure you eat enough dont be afraid to eat  or  cups of rice at a time or a whole box of pasta eat mostly carbs pastas rice potatoes fruit etc and youll notice feeling better in no time at all,NOT
went vegan  years ago after watching food choices and cowspiracy on netflix ,NOT
trisha isnt even capable of being a vegetarian let alone a vegan,NOT
she already failedi know you cant be vegan over night but dang at least try to cut out meat,NOT
all women together need to pull out of any competition that a transgender is in and let them have there owned competition,ABU
but men work harder and are superior overall ,ABU
telling trisha that shes not transgender is no different than other people in the past being told they just have a mental illness that come out as transgender  anyone can be transgender just bc she doesnt qualify as trans to some doesnt mean she isnt love and acceptance should be towards everyone,NOT
just get short hair thats all,NOT
wouldnt it be much more risky for a business to pay women less money and therefore more costly if you dont work as much or do difficult jobswell of course your not getting paid as much you can either work like a man all the time or have kids stop being selfish telling yourself you can have it all,NOT
and may god save our planet and those with morals who live a plant based lifestyle because nothing will save those who take part in animal cruelty and consumption,NOT
heres an idea maybe we shouldnt care so much about how much men vs women make and just encourage everyone to pursue the job they want so long as men and women are both paid on merit rather than gender then the pay gap wont matter,NOT
this is just a terribly argued piece of propaganda its too bad only conservative organizations like mr pragers have money to run these desperate youtube adds,NOT
i always look forward watching the next vegan film and realize each year it gets better great job ,NOT
there is no gender wage gap,NOT
yasgurl  congratulations watch mommy tang  shell show you how to be a glam milf vegan ,NOT
its like kramer kicking ass in the kids judo class on seinfeld,ABU
this a lie and ola videofreelee paid her to go vegan she is eating meat now,NOT
it is true that women are less likely to choose stem fields but there is a reason for this women are less encouraged to choose these higher paying jobs since their early life they life society discourages them and burdens them with stereotypes therefore they dont choose higher paying jobs because they think men will do better,NOT
am i the only know who cant stop looking at her nails,NOT
i look forward to pbns vegan recaps every year vegan for  years ,NOT
the earnings gap is one of the most hilarious public policy discussions of today because  i dont think the government should force women to go into fields solely because they pay more  i dont think the government should force women to work more hours than men to offset the difference in hours worked  i dont think the government should force women to make specific decisions in which job to take  which salary to accept  i dont think the government should force women to be unable to take time off from work for childcare  childbirth  i dont think the government should force women to demand higher pay over healthcare or other benefits,NOT
k triggered feminists xd,NOT
reap what youve sow liberals,NOT
i dont want to look weird but in the end the man and the woman are part of the same body you cant do with a leg what you can do with hand and vice versa sometimes its possible but generally if not always one is more efficient than the other depending the case i do not like stereotypes but maybe unconsciously for example a man is stronger physical than a woman however a woman is better when there its about communications anyway i believe that maybe it would be a good idea for everybody if we tried to make a better use of our qualities than trying to balance everything,NOT
this gave me a heart attack ,NOT
in two weeks youre not going to loose weight i loose weight in about a three months,NOT
beans rice and veggies go for meatlike veggies like mushrooms too,NOT
its your truth honey you live it how you want thankful for your honesty,NOT
gigi said that her vid isnt a troll and that they had a phone call confirming so i personally believe trishas doing this for clout,ABU
why arent girls who are transitioning to boys out there trying to compete with boys because no matter how much they try few would be able to succeed at it since biological males have the advantage in almost all cases of athletic competition except one  the balance beam in gymnastics,NOT
thats totally unfair your taking peoples scholarship at a totally unfair advantage you will never be  female sorry but you cant just do that its stupid that this is even happening,ABU
nina and randa have a lot of good what i eat in day viedos a lot of them are just beans rice and sweet potatoes lol but they also have other recipes like healthy vegan mac and cheese pizza veggie burgers snack ideas ect,NOT
is thats its fake  second video,NOT
get some strawberries and melted dark chocolate  get chips that are vegan most already are,NOT
tbh i thin there should always be on person being the houshold caretaker and one to provide for the household and not both working at the same time,NOT
i thought this might add more credibility if typed by a woman there is no wage gap theres an earnings gap based on career choices women make paying two people different wages based on gender is illegal if youve been compensated unfairly dont take off an hour at work contact the labor board because laws exist to protect you among millennials the highest paid demographic are single females because millennial women are earning way more college degrees than men and are thus getting better paying jobs mostly because public school education favors females speaking of stem half the medical students and the vast majority of biology students are female last time i checked medicine and biology are sciences dont believe the feminist propaganda perpetuated by womens studies courses its not based on reality ok definitely my last post on here,NOT
i subscribed thank you for your content you help educate me in ways that people think are impossible ive been saying celebs coming out with all of their different identifications has been for clout but everyone likes slapping me with the homophob or sexist tags when im genuinely just like these celebs are doing it for clout,NOT
im a bit confused by the video because i have trish on sc so i see what she wears on a daily basis and when she films videos and this on seems like she filmed it a few weeks back correct me if im wrong but is she not wearing the dress she wore to shanes premier did she not just film a music video i honestly could be completely wrong and i hope so,NOT
why dont u freaks just find and island and u all go live there disgusting no wonder people cant stand u all,ABU
theyre running against girls and still almost loosing,NOT
this is so dumb vegan propaganda,NOT
love this ive been vegan for  months now and its awesome,NOT
i dare you to title your next video im coming out ,NOT
this video was filmed weeks ago your nail polish is different and you had that pink  weeks ago and last night you had chicken this video is to up the views on freelees channel,NOT
theres only two possibilities here women are ignorant of the fact that more demanded skills more hours and more experiencemore pay or they are trying to justify getting something for nothing victim status can be used as a weapon never forget that,ABU
the future is fucking vegan ,NOT
you can buy some type of plant milk like almond rice oat its very creamy and you can use it for your coffee you can also eat stuff like soy meat etc last but not least rice beans pasta potatoes ,NOT
in the same job if they do the same thing they are paid the same of course it wouldnt count on different jobs and a wage gap is how much they get on the same job in the same place earning gap is when you have less because you want more and you spend a lot compared to those who dont,NOT
stick to this stuff you made some excellent points religion not your strength,NOT
wait what smh pls stop im a girl a dont wear makeup all the time i look plain af and when i do my makeup i do full glam but that doesnt mean anything most girls do it i wont go around saying im drag or trans,NOT
my girlfriend sent me this and its nice to see women not jumping on the wage gap myth and seeking the truth,NOT
good luck doll cant wait to see how this turns out for you cutting back a lot on alcohol or completely eliminating it from your diet would help immensely as well just a suggestion if you still needwant to drink do you but even if u only had one day a week that you allowed yourself to drink you would lose a good amount of wieght also eat more throughout the day as that speeds up your metabolism whereas if u starve yourself or only eat once or twice a day your body stores fat cuz it doesnt know when u will feed it again good luck to you doll xo,NOT
but so happy u know whats really going on,NOT
give this woman a medal i demand it,NOT
im proud to be vegan,NOT

i dont think women are complaining that the female regional manager for a mediumsized business is making less than the ceo of a major oil company i think theyre complaining that the same female manager is making less than the male regional manager at the same company to do the same job also a chemical engineering degree is only high paying if you find a job so its pretty telling that you chose list the ratio of those enrolled in the program rather than the ones actually employed in a related field,NOT
wendy williams went vegan ,NOT
did you count college drop outshigh school drop outsthe difference in job fields when it comes to pay  and ectif you did then you would know that the pay gap isnt caused by sexism but the decisions people make in college and highschool example one kid has a major in art  the other has a major in chemical engineering which would pay more people would say chem engineer but what if the artist was incredibly talented and had good advertising skills than that artist would pay more no matter the gender so if the chem engineer was male and the artist female would you say im wrong  plus what if said artist decided to do commissions by companies and also bid paintings online  so now do you think that the female artist is no richer than some one like steve jobs so through those decisions the artist is rich while the engineer is the average male  but whats the difference  the only difference is the one is talented while the other has no talent nor exceptional education in the field so the only one thats to blame is himself for not picking the most suitable job im thirteen and even i can tell some of what you said was bs ,NOT
lol under s comment there is a chick calling this the patriarchy it must be them darn men at it again and their feminist movement,NOT

there is not a single person in his or her right mind that things this fucken travesty is within reason you have two black males competing against white asian hispanic girls do they use the same lockers and show their big black dicks to the teenage girls all those tv personalities are too afraid of offending anybody by taking a stand as if they didnt have daughters of their own one of the fucken pieces of shit one of the black males said that the girls should try to run faster,ABU
my biggest advice is to start by eating normally meaning continue to eat the food you loved to eat before eat on vegan restaurants search for vegan replacement products etc to start with and get used to it to not feel like something is missing if you do good without it dont  but make sure to eat enough carbs proteins fiber calcium etc dont listen to supposed healthy diet that wont last long just as raw til  this one is made for people who want to maintain their weight or who have a hella fast metabolism which i guess is not yours just as it wasnt mine because i have always been rounder and this doesnt work for that type of body meaning that even if im thin i will still be rounder or curvier what works for me and people i know is just to continue eating normal and dont go with the extreme healthy vegan diets yet  raw diet raw til  good luck ,NOT
im a female who dresses masculine does that make me trans too,NOT
omg heard about you had to see for myself new subscriber,NOT

ok so lets reverse the situation a girl born a girl transitions to a boy with some hormone therapy now basically this person is going to get dusted and theres no doubt about it and i bet if they werent so bias and werent trans they would say boy what are you doing on that team you finna get dusted and look stupid and thats how those girls on that team felt about themselves when the transgenders joined the team and i dont mean that in a harsh way but they need a reality and check and try not to be so selfish because they have about every right we have but lets keep the sports fair at least,ABU
i like her,NOT
morgan is such a drama queen complete disregard for decent journalism should be ashamed,NOT

im actually choosing my major this year and im going for the major that i like and not necessarily for the one that pays the most so are all the girls in my class however the boys are going for the majors that pay the most cause they need to have a good income if theyre gonna care for their family someday and you seriously dont expect them to earn more pathetic,NOT
trisha or t or any name you decide to use i dont know where to start with this video i myself am a gay transgender male the huge thing with being transgender is the want for more masculinity than feminism i like to present myself as a male dress as a male be called a male seen as a male nothing else not my birth gender i have dysphoria causing me to dislike my chest my genital and anything that makes me look or seem more like a female all true transgender males have dysphoria and discomfort with being a transgender male you do not identify with being a girl the birth gender you want masculinity you want to be seen as a girl i honestly believe you are a little confused and questioning look into being gender fluid gender fluid is when some days you love to present yourself as a male then some as a female people who are gender fluid us hehim and sheher pronouns most often meaning you dont have to use theythem pronouns please just look into it  also a lot of the stuff in your video is very offensive you say you dont like labels yet youre using them gay males are perceived as galled up and feminine in a way but most arent that way also saying you believe youre transgender due to loving short hair not having to tend to it girls and others can feel the same also when you say straight men turn you off that is so darn weird you automatically arent attracted to a male because theyre not gay thats almost like being transexual only liking and wanting to date trans men and women its just really strange and i dont agree with judging someone on their sexuality its almost heterophobia ,NOT
this is great trisha your going to feel amazing over the next two weeks ,NOT
holy crap a decent vox video with reason and facts,NOT
this is fake yall like im trans and pan,NOT

the answer is quite simple dont have kids,NOT
james charles likes straight men and trisha likes gay men,NOT
freelee is that thin because she does so so much sports its rather about sports not about being vegan,NOT

women were raped murdered for thousands of years to be able to compete in sports  now a ton of mentally ill men think they are girls and elites play make believe with them this is oppression they have no right in our teams bathrooms etc,ABU
lol watching this video eating ice cream,NOT
what happens if the the wage gap flips and men start earning less money then women,NOT
lolol i saw you sneak in professional stick figure artist at the end great video tho you forgot to mention that the wage gap for single women is  basically nothing,NOT
check out mommytang her videos are the bomb,NOT
i dont think trisha is on drugs i do think she is having some mental health issues going on and possibly on the verge of a break down she seems very manicbipolar i hope she gets the mental help she needs,ABU
i dont believe her,NOT
gasp im going vegan for  weeks as well and hopefully forever i just hate watching documentaries about how people treat the animals so i failed the last time i went vegan i was hooked on being vegetarian after i saw documentaries so thats all what i got to do i recommend you watch one when youre at the point of giving up it really helps keep educating yourself trish love you ,NOT
im screaming whatvis she thinking dndndjd,NOT
it makes me sooo happy to see normal thinking people in the comments please keep these corrupt people out of government and vote trump ,NOT
i think this is so hilarious cis woman will never win in sports again and they just sit around either too scared to say anything or will actually cheer on the dudes beating themlol and just listen to the parents reasoning it makes her happy or it makes her comfortable with who she wants to be etc its so selfish its all about how they feel and not the obvious problems this is going to have on cis female sports and their parents dont even care about the other girls that they unfairly defeated its just all about them,ABU
i get where youre coming from but maybe shes genderfluid and just is having a hard time figuring it out ive bounced between non binary and genderfluid i tend to stray away from non binary just because it seems to get more backlash and i dont really know why im afab sometimes i feel feminine sometimes i feel masculine get over it if we can accept trans people for just feeling the complete opposite why cant we accept people who feel both idk just dont get it i guess,NOT
crap if everyone becomes vegan the government will poison the grass,NOT
sounds like gender fluid lmao,NOT
i always knew this when i found out some people thought women earn less than men in america because of discrimination i was very surprised they actually think so,NOT
instead of getting packaged fruit to eat get the whole thing like watermelon cantelope etc make tons of smoothies with frozen fruit and almond milk and spinach drink lots of ice water with lemon lime or cucumber and replace meat and dairy products with rice and beans salsa and condiments,NOT
if they really want to go down this path might i suggest handicapped races with time penalties and the like the transgendered athletes still get the experience of competing and being included whilst it makes it fairer on the biologically born females,ABU
you got man hands dude,NOT
p r e a c h,NOT
i like that she as a woman is telling us this  proving that not all women believe in the wage gap  this really helps to show its not just evil men blindly denying a wage gap,NOT
the video confused me a bit so does the gender gap exist or not what i took away from the video is that the average woman earns less than the average man because she works less hours if so then logic dictates that the gap doesnt exist its just statistics that lean towards mens favour,NOT
being vegan is easy and feels amazing ive been skinny fat all my lifethin but unhealthy when i went vegan i lost a few pounds right away my digestion improved so much and stomach cramps disappeared and i learned how to feed myself food thats satisfying and yummy i dont miss eating animals at all,NOT
 earning  of the male earnings not  less still terrible that that has to be the case though,NOT
as someone with actual gender dysphoria and who identifies as trans this really pisses me off its people like trisha who have a large platform and spread wrong information about the transgender community everything she said in this video is wrong im not saying that shes wrong or anything but i think shes confused and she doesnt actually know what shes saying she needs to go see a therapist or something and get this figured out before spreading it on social media she needs someone to tell her the difference between feeling more masculine  tomboy versus being transgender and having actual gender dysphoria after all she did say that she identified with her sex  which you dont find in non binary people trans people or whatever,NOT
this addition of transgender women who were born male in these competitions is unfair men have more fasttwitch muscle fibers as well as longer arms bigger hands denser bones men have a larger percentage of hemoglobin in the blood men have greater aerobic capacity and greater capacity to transport oxygen in the blood males and females have completely different bone structures males have larger hearts lungs arteries veins tendons etc no amount of hormone treatment can neutralize all of these differences i support trans peoples rights to be free of discrimination but biological males should not be allowed to compete against women in athletic competitions,ABU
 feminist disliked this video,NOT
money is worth nothing on its own its what you buy with it that has value right women control where  of all money is spent even if women as a whole made  of the money men make they would still have more effective spending power than men,NOT
this is awesome,NOT

 female or male trans or not trans we all have a balance of masculine and feminine energy shes clearly confused about that has she never heard someone tell a straight cis man to embrace his feminine side,NOT
i cant get over how much u look like you were female born,NOT
been almost vegan for  days now i say almost because i still have my whey protein powder and my fish oil tablets today i throw them away i am  i really do hope that we can all go vegan before it is too late but i believe that the only way this will happen is when we have no choice govs and big industries have only one thing on their mind profit profit over health profit over the survival of the planet,NOT
if you want to be both then be gender fluid identify as both males and female,NOT
what kind of fuckery,ABU
im so happy that you are getting educated and interested in veganism just remember that being on a vegan diet doesnt mean you have to be on a strict healthy diet vegan food doesnt equal healthy food dont think that its about eating really healthy and trying to lose weight for me its all about the animals environment and other humans on earth im a junk food vegan and im happy i love oreos vegan donuts vegan benjerrys etc i hope you stick to this compassionate way of eating,NOT
i had goosebumps watching it yas lets go vegans,NOT

never change vox,NOT
so do u identity as she,NOT
this isnt sexism its just common sense best sentence in the entire video lmao,NOT
just bc trisha is masculine with her assertiveness doesnt mean shes a man women shouldnt think that bc they do something considered manly means that they are a guy vice versa no guys should think they are a woman bc of something feminine these stereotypes were put into place just recently in the grand scheme bc guys used to wear dresses its just fashion and surface stuff i had a bestfriend who was trans and believe me i know the confusion of a trans in the first years of transitioning and for her to make a mockery out of it bc she thinks gay guys are hot lol i find a ton of gay guys hot am i trans no,NOT
thank you and thank you and   thank you for your films  you help the animals the planet and people i hope the message would spread even more on  and that people will realize that we need to change our habits in order to save the planet and leave a planet to next generations happy new vegan year   ,NOT

good luck with the vegan diet ill stick with keto personally,NOT
i also think that there can be a massive shift in the impact of the meat and dairy markets if non vegans simply cut out one day or more of animal consumption  non vegans having a vegan day in the week equals same no vegan meals as  vegan no im genuinely wondering if this would have an impact,NOT
shes trolling theres no way that someone thats put that much work into being a woman has a problem being a woman i mean just no love ya blaire  i am not trans but ive had penis envy for years if that helps trish any lol,NOT
im a werewolf,NOT
the wage gap does exist men earn more than women look at any statistic and it will tell you that and you cant deny it because it is a proven fact but saying that its because of the patriarchy and this and that and blah blah blah is absolute hogwash,NOT

i dont like labels yet you label yourself everything under the sun okay then,NOT
strongest animals on the planet r vegan cant argue with that unless u r truly brain dead,NOT
im not ok with my birth sex i have a phantom peneus but i decided not to transition and to turn my lemons into lemonade because i do like men and i know transitioning would make dating triply hard and i dont want to lose friends and family and i dont want to go through puberty again i dont want to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a million surgeries so im just stuck here and ive had to accept it,NOT
idk who i should feel bad for jason or the lgbtq community,NOT
wat is she saying,NOT
so happy for you trish you can do it ,NOT
good for you psa you can get starbucks made with soy or coconut milk and ask for no whipped cream,NOT
the real problem with women in the work force is there are stigmas against women doing certain jobs and some male and even female employers would rather hire a man thinking hed do a better job this happens less and less year after year as less and less we are told to pursue careers that are for girls or for boys so there is an issue but its not the lack of equal pay for equal work,NOT
at taco bell get beens instead of meat and ask for no cheese or dairy products and youll be ,NOT
gary yourofsky the problem is that humans have victimized animals to such a degree that they are not even considered victims they are not even considered at all they are nothing they dont count they dont matter theyre commodities like tv sets and cell phones we have actually turned animals into inanimate objects  sandwiches and shoes,NOT
cool someone who supports the wage gap idea but actually gives reasoning for it aside from men are terrible and nasty im on your side vox,NOT
can you please change the title of this video to trish goes vegan for  minutes this was such a lie she is eating chicken and waffles in her snapchat,NOT
go trish so proud of you,NOT
i just dont understand how they could be proof of this i just dont think its fair,NOT
essentially this video is correct and i agree with it however it is misleading to call it a wage gap if you want to get rid of the wage gap stop comparing yearly earnings hours worked times pay per hour but instead just compare the pay per hour there is no difference in pay per hour therefore no wage gap a womans decision to have children is her own choice and she should take into account that she will make less pay if she works less hours to take care of her children seems pretty obvious but anyway its not societies problem,NOT
in the video there is no gender wage gap it starts off by stating a statistic that a lot of sources use that women are paid  cents per every male dollar from the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real it states that women are paid  cents to every male dollar which is not far off from  cents the video i watched had a female presenting all the stats and opinions which is very clever by prager u who posted the video why not show a female talking about how there is no gender wage gap it just adds onto their argument the video states that if a person factors in different choices each gender makes on top of occupation position education and hours per week then then the wage gap nearly diminishes down to  cents i feel as if a person cannot just factor in choices because not everyone is in the same situation many women want families so when women are pregnant they go on maternal leave as long as they need or are allowed also women have been proven to do more work around the house and also take time off to be there for their kids women cannot be discriminated against just because of their choices it does not matter their choices also the video does not take into account the fact of race as we learned in class black and hispanic women are paid a lot less than women who are white or asian which is from the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real overall we can each have our own opinion if there is or is not a gap but the video there is no gender wage gap is filled with fallacies that are opinion based and not fact and research based like the article what is the gender pay gap and is it real,NOT
this is crazyness on a new level i wouldnt want to be in the same change room or bathroom as these guys this make women and girls vulnerable cause anatomically these people are not females,ABU
this better be how it doesnt exist,NOT
this reminds me of the trans girl out here in texas that was on the girls wrestling team and was sweeping all competition even winning state biology is biology bigger faster and stronger on your laziest day not an even playing field,NOT
trish you live in la there are plenty of vegan restaurants if you dont feel like cooking or just eating fruit all day,NOT
very unfair if transgender really wants to compete in sports then they should have their own league,ABU
identifies as transgender but still identifies as birth gender,NOT
as one of  males at my job with  female co workers who constantly call off switch days or just feel like cramping at work there should be a wage gap the law under osha says all work is to be equal male or female and its not men work harder and more is expected of them so who do i sue if im expected to do your job honey i want your money,NOT
sure trisha paytas is transgender transgender is a mood i myself identify as a hippo,NOT
great work guys love what youre doing for the movement,NOT
 things cause a gap in wages choice analytics and apathy the first of the main issues with choice of field of work was highlighted and dramatically reduced the gap secondly males by nature are neither the most emotional or caring of our race for this reason males make a great choice for doing rolls that are terrible eg garbage man trauma cleaner plummers etc and even in the same field compare a contracts or criminal lawyer against a family or immigration lawyer and there will be a higher number of males in the worse areas further because of the lack of emotional it makes the able to make decisions based on an analytical process rather than personal feelings at the same time these traits are terrible for someone that works in other roles such as child care nursing etc but thats not to say either side of our race is any better than the other it just means that different people are suited or enjoy different roles further not all males or females follow the inherent typical male or female ways of thinking which is solely why we do see male in roles that females enjoy and vice versa in actuality its not actually a problem not only because most people are married at some point and share their income or though logically we might actually want to enforce a pay gap for married men to be payed more to give mothers the option of being able to spend more bonding time with their children because children arent a burden they are something special to love and care for,ABU
unfair advantagegee ya think sorry but i dont feel sorry for those who started this crap to begin with and are now crying fowl,ABU
no no no,NOT
finally keep going i hope this is an eye opener for many people,NOT
my sociology teacher was spewing bs about the wage gap saying women with a better degree and better experience wont get paid as much as men just because they are female i hit her with the why would companies not hire only women she literally had no response and all the girls and beta males who were agreeing with her couldnt argue i went on to explain into further detail and they all just sat there and then said oh you may be right i never thought of that,NOT

as much as time has change and they are improvements men always fucking with us women  we cant get a break for shit  we birth yall so yall can go against us ,NOT
whats needed up is that the media gives a bigger platform for trans people to speak than for other to criticize them for their unfiarness,ABU
ridiculous id be one the concerned parents some of girls in the race vid were clearly upset,NOT
i know whats really right there only to genders,NOT
funny how all the liberal wage gap blaring feminists i know are baristas at starbucks or waitresses working towards a career as a low paying social worker where are all the female engineers and lawyers complaining that they dont make the money of their coworkers,NOT

wtf k usd per year whaat,NOT
so do we not still see an issue with the fact that every discrepancy is chalked up to choice its not that hard to imagine that there are social pressures at play for men to occupy certain jobs and women to occupy certain jobs,NOT
this comment section is appalling im assuming everyone here is high school educated wage gap  men work have higher paying jobs work longer hours etc remember what the equal sign means everyone the wage gap is the fact that men work higher paying jobs work longer hours etc yes theres still straight up discrimination that goes down but thats not the point we have a society and economy that accommodates men more so than women simply because women have kids take on more unpaid responsibilities associated with kids etc women are accommodated less in our economy solely due to the fact they are women and biologically have burdens that men do not birthing children this is a systemic issue not an individual issue  like the video clearly stated a good first step is to make hours more flexible in positions and make paid maternity leave federally legal and required for all women this way women can work longer hours higher payer jobs etc and close the wage gap the amount of misinterpretation in these comments is appalling this is why trump is president americans are dumb ,NOT
correction earnings gap,NOT
trisha literally need to stay away from yt and social media honestly,NOT
i think you glazed over the fact that men dont share the parental responsibilitiesunpaid childcare house that women work that really seems to be the bigger issue,NOT
good luck girl love you,NOT
what youre listing as reasons to why youre trans those are more like transphobia fetishization and misogyny,NOT

omg a vox vid thats not sjwy,NOT
quinoa and edemame is your bff,NOT
looks like women love to social engineer by capturing and brainwashing children,NOT
good for you trish  love you ,NOT
i agree with most of the things said in here and btw you are beautiful but when people come out as whatever they want to come out as wether its trans bisexual gay etc they dont necessarily have to talk about it  some people are more shy and like to keep their sexuality as something personal especially big actors like jaden smith and some youtubers so sometimes they just want to let their fanbase know more about them and just because they announced it does not mean that they have to mention their sexuality in every conversation ya feel but hey thats just my opinion i definitely think that trish is either a troll or that she genuinely needs help,NOT
several feminists are typing,NOT
i dont care what they transition to even with hormone treatment they still have the muscle mass of males they can identify as females but they are males at the end of the day and it is unfair for them to compete against women it will be interesting to see if they continue their track careers once they leave high school and how if they will be allowed to compete against women,ABU
like when maddox said it two years ago but with more credibility when it is a woman saying it,NOT
you look so beautiful,NOT
when chickfila is the ad before a freelee video ,NOT
im not even a trans but this feels too offensive to me,NOT
why cant you just be a masculine woman you said you liked the energy of being a boy ig is how it made sense to me but your not a boy you just want big dick energy im just curious no hate,NOT
but after years of abuse on your body you may not lose the weight instantly i suffered from binge eating and processed food and it took about  months for my body to heal and start loosing weight,NOT
my friend tried to debate me on this she believes all this stuff about the wage gap but when i tried to explain to her that the statistics dont account for different jobs she said no women get paid less for working the same job i asked her what specific jobs she meant then and she said the jobs they do studies on that drove me nuts you cant just read a study and not even look at where they got the information like seriously what do people think happen that women just get handed a  cent check at subway after their shift and men get handed a dollar you cant pay people differently just based on their gender anyways i should show her this video,NOT
yes trish proud of you x,NOT
i love your videos but shes an internet troll everyone knows that lol its a joke,NOT
imagine eating fake meat if u think meat is bad for ur health lol,NOT
those trans girls or biologically male should definitely lay low and try not to win every single track meet,NOT
freelee you need to watch pewdiepie s video on sorsha the vegan asap,NOT

hey guys so i readily in debating on whether or not going vegan for my own health and all the animals health can some of you all please give me advice on how to start off vegan and how to stay vegan thanks guys ,NOT
this is why we need bernie sanders,NOT
if you want to be vegan to lose some weight but you buy all kind of vegan processed food like vegan chips or vegan chicken vegan steak etc you are not going to lose weight and later you will say  veganism didnt help you it doesnt work etc etc you need to learn to eat fresh fruits make smothies drink water learn to eat salads raw vegetables whole foods like brown rice or bread like simple foods in order to really give clean energy to your body if you dont do that you are losing your time veganism is a life style not a diet,NOT
what a fucking trainwreck sorry to all of the transgender people out there,ABU
what a joke modern society is theyre men simple as,ABU
this is fuckinf horrible and her posting this video is horrible she is ridiculous,ABU
wow this video shows so much bias,NOT
check out kalel cullen,NOT
even if there is or isnt a wage gape any intelligent person will agree that sexism still runs through our world and culture,NOT
realistically they should compete against males not females,ABU
i think what trisha is dealing with is gender expression and not gender identity,NOT
well done girlxx,NOT
jesus christ some people are actually completely ignorant the wage gap is real and this video provides an insight into why this gap exists yes women earn less but this video talks about the choices women take regarding dealing with children and what career they choose it doesnt blame anyone in fact its one of the few videos about the wage gap that actually gives a clear solution or advice at the very least to help guide to less of a wage gap but people still feel the need to not watch the video and spam with wage gap doesnt exist,NOT
where is feminists now,NOT
im glad a woman is explaining this,NOT
oh fuck i never wear makeup or do my hair ive definitely crushed on gay guys before i guess im trans call me steve,NOT
great film klaus xxxden vegan  months feeling great x,NOT
the real question is what in the hell did trisha do to her lips did she stick them in a suction pump or something,NOT
i love you so much for clearing this up my head hurts from hearing people saying its a thing so many times ,NOT
i havent had a moment when ive had a crush on a hot gay man cause im a lesbian,NOT
thats unfair as shit,ABU
this is one of the first good videos on the wage gap ive seen it shows that the gap isnt due to companys being sexist but infact due to the types of jobs men and women tend to take,NOT
well most of the yaoi anime is aimed at girls not gay men girls like gay dudes probably for similar reason blokes like lesbians,NOT
i am so showing this to the feminists in my family,NOT
trisha i dont identify as multiple personally im transgender jk i dont like they them pronouns me who is trans use they them pronouns and who has did  ight imma head out,NOT
nobody cares about your stupid career whats important is the love that comes from the babys you make women didnt have to work before now they have to work thats your equal rights,NOT
fuck this nigga or what i say they are both fucking gay thats all,ABU
can the west not export this kind of insanity to the rest of the world please,ABU
fuck trolling trashy trisha i was a long time subscriber of hers and chose to look away when shed past controversial troll videos over the years sometimes i even found humor in them however when she faked opiate withdrawal i pulled the plug on financing her hoarding lifestyle as someone who has struggled with opiate dependency due to chronic and deteriorating issues within my spine that was negatively impacted by this hocus pocus bullshit narrative spun by the government across media increasingly so over the past six to seven years in addition to losing several friends and family member because of overdoses because they were strong armed into illegally sourcing opiates which ended up being this imported chinese super fentanyl fancily made to appear like their normal medication that had previously helped them have any sort of quality of life but was ripped away from them because of a god damn government experiment ps earlier this year the opiate epidemic was found by the ciaag to be a government experiment much like the s crack issue if anyone would like i can provide a link to their findings which have sources linked to gov web addresses,NOT
thank you gives me hope every year love these films,NOT
i cant believe this delusional reporter at  no no noooit is not appropriate for boys to compete against girls,NOT
tofurky is really nice also beans are good protein im a vegan but i live in the uk and there arent as many options but there are in the us xxx,NOT
many women choose to have children some dont exactly choose ofc depending on the situation but its seems very clear that the wage gap is a natural occurance due to the differences between men and women equality of opportunity does not always equal a mean equality of outcome thats not a nessisarily a bad thing men and women are different and thats the end of it be proud of your gender and strive to do well,NOT
i love freelee cause you know when our in class and people cant stop talking and you just wish the teacher would slap each of those kids and send them to the office shes like that you know if people arent going to listen shes gonna be bitchy about it but i love it people will not listen until you shove it in there face like its the only way to get people to care,NOT
eat only whole plant foods like brown rice potato and fruits for great health and maximum weight loss if you are scared about protein beans like lentils are your best friends with this you will have more nutrients than with almost all other diets animal protein or not and avoid vegan processed foods including bread they will make you fat no matter how vegan they are theyre totally fine once in a while but only if you ate properly for a long time and it will harm the whole plant food weight loss that you can get when coming off of a animal protein diet,NOT
wow thats an awesome step trisha,NOT
i see nothing wrong with people competing regardless their sex or gender,NOT
to be any gender on any day is basically being gender fluid im personally gender fluid and i go by hehim theythem pronouns but i dont identify as transgender if anything i acknowledge that sometimes being fluid feels like im constantly transitioning because i dont have a fixed gender but i am not trans its just some food for thought but i support you wanting to express your masculinity and whatever way that may be,NOT
so you dont like straight men or girls but only gay guys,NOT
trisha just be who u want to be dont listen to what anyone says their opinion doesnt matter just love yourself and be happy being who u r u can be whatever u want as long as it makes u happy people are gonna hate but thats life and if they cant accept that than the hell with them just make urself happy being u i wish u all the best in ur journey and life,NOT
i was a big meat eater the vegan movement is right im giving my best to make the change,NOT
this isnt a complicated argument potentially this is feminism clashing with the lgbtq agendadance my puppets dance,NOT
if you need to make a video explaining a widely believed misconception then it must not be common sense,NOT
i really dont think there is a gender wage gap for blimp pilots largely because at this point i feel like there are only like  left and i feel like they are all  year old divorce men with names like horace victor and ralph,NOT
fake for views this vid is weeks old,NOT
i turned vegetarian about  months ago trying to be vegan soon i still eat cheese and ice cream but no eggs or regular milk so i got sick kind of badly and im the only one in my family that is vegetarian and everyone hates on me and they say i get no protein i drink a protein shake every morning and i went to the doctor and my dad asked could she have gotten sick because she has started not eating meat or chicken or fish  and she said no not at all which made me happy because he wanted her to say yes she needs to stop it was a little victory and i wanted to share it ,NOT
shes trying to stay relevant by using a shock value of extreme stupidity she knows whats doing she also knows her idiotic video is going to make waves,NOT
k ignorant feminist watched this video,NOT
i like how you were eating chickfila for this situation but yeah transha is godamn fujoshi,ABU
couldnt care less let the females complain,NOT
you make me so fucking angry i hope someone hit you with their car while jasons in the passenger seat fucking hell how do you always manage to surprise people by being so god damn stupid i hope you realize that everyone hates you cause videos like this one you dont have multiple personalities and you are for sure not trans fuck you,ABU
yay im so happy your vegan make sure you eat a lot and try not to get really hungry because you will go back to meat and dairy smoothies are really great but eat other stuff too because they dont keep you full for long there are so many great cookbooks for vegans and you will have to cook your meals also there is a lot of stuff at whole foods that is vegan otherwise good luck,NOT
im so fucking confused,NOT
they are great runners with a strong passion but seem to have the wrong conception of the reality of their own true gender i cant just believe yes means no just because i feel that way same thing for these two athletes they cant just believe being born male biologically means theyre girls because they feel that way feelings are important but you cant use feelings to block facts they are male they have male parts and have testosterone and theyre physical features are male like as well you cant just put on fake hair and believe that your officially a girl and run girl sports its okay to be trans its okay to change your body this way but it is not okay to lie about your true gender if you havent gone through any of the true major changes at the moment these two athletes have barely gone through any changes i mean its quite strange the fact that i can just go up to my track coach with fake long hair and tell them i wanna run for the girls although im biologically male,NOT
veganise meals that you already eat thats how i started ,NOT
watch mommytang vegan mukbangs it also includes her recipes,NOT
freelee is gonna loose her shit,NOT
an nra tv ad on this video  yeah youtube get your shit together,NOT
simple solution to theze sickos that call themselves transgenderzlet them only compete in sports among themselvesend of story  it is sick  wrong for a male to be allowed to compete against a female in theze kind of sportsperiod  ,ABU
i am sry but this video isnt abou facts u started well but if u come to the question why more men are in higher well payed positions u just say individuell carreer choices would be important to get some statistics about how many women tried to get the job or would work harderlonger or longer to get it,NOT
proud of worlds eating approach are changing,NOT
some of these girls need the scholarships and recruitment they get from potentially winning these track meets in order to go to college theyre quite literally depriving these girls from opportunities in order to accommodate for the two transgender teens,NOT
almost a good and balanced report but your premise still expects society to fix the choices which women make voluntarily which is more important childrearing or making money why is money the only measure of a successful life and the only way in which feminists feel that a womens worth should be measured what about happiness and fulfilment and family many women do and always will put these aspects of life ahead of making money this will never change and therefore the wagegap read earnings gap will never disappear,NOT
why do you not have  million subscribers yet,NOT
i love how feminists like to complain about the supposed wage gap but are completely silent to the fact that women as a demographic take more money from the government than they give in taxes in short women pay no taxes and get additional money while men have to carry the entire system and get much less than that,ABU
my only referral to you is morning star foods the corn dogs are super yummy hamburgers the chicken nuggets and i think they have bbq ribs too doesnt that sound yummy anyways try it out and let us hear what you think,NOT
boca vegan burgers are really good ,NOT
 then run with the men thenthat way if you lose in your own words itll just push you to run faster also yall would be seen as brave since yall would be different from everybody they dont see how their own logic can be used against them was she expecting them to say it would be unfair they cant say that even if they thought so otherwise they would be admitting they are in the wrong if they were actual born females they would feel the same way as those girls,ABU
vox is even admitting its not based on people being sexists can feminists shut up now,ABU
trishas just having an identity crisis which goes with having bpd,NOT
girl trust me  you will never go back,NOT
your pronouns are that bitch you got me rolling with laughter,ABU
well ill tell my jobs i work for private security where ill work as a bouncer for up to  an hour security escort for all kinds of stuff up to  an hour and to transfer prisoners riding in a van for hours with murders rapists and drug dealers inches away up to  an hour now how many women are gonna do these jobs where ive been beaten stabbed and shot multiple times because ive yet to see any,NOT

i dont think that wage and earnings should be conflated to the degree that discussion on this issue has caused,NOT
i wish they made it clear in the video that this pertains to white women,NOT
this was addressed back in the s and the s it is finally beginning to be acknowledged as a real issue factory farming of animals is so sad i tell people i love animals and thats why i dont eat them non meat eater since a little child,NOT
women take care of the kids while the male works the harder or more dangerous job to generate better income whats new let me be a female so i can be a housekeeper while my partner works ill take that any day,NOT

this is prerecorded ,NOT
trisha should identify as a blowfish that would make more sense,NOT

just a thought when watching the vegan donating blood  would a meat eaters blood affect a vegan who received said blood,NOT

now this is a real feminist,NOT
this isnt cool at all im not the type of guy to attack people because as someone who is ftm with dysphoria but also likes makeup and stuff ive been called a trans trender and all that but first of all just because you think life would be easier as a guy doesnt mean you are a guy and being attracted to more feminine men does not mean youre a gay man its just preference this really just hurts to watch because you used to be one of my favorite people but this video deeply hurts me,NOT
i want to be vegan but its almost impossible with a family that eats meat like everyday,NOT
they obviously have an advantage biologically i feel bad for them but u cant deny that they have an advantage,ABU

i have been vegetarian for  years and i was planning to go vegan my parents wont let me i dont know how to convince them,NOT
r u fucking kidding me,ABU
why does that look like trish but at the same time not look like trish,NOT
setting the story straight is good and all but you literally confirmed there is a wage gap,NOT
also the fact that women give birth and want to raise their family means they have to sacrifice a high end job or full time hours in order to be with her family and raise them they can work part time maximum if they want to actually have time for their family life is all about making sacrifices if you are working in a high end job you often sacrifice your family time and free time if you are working a small part time job you are sacrificing your income in order to have more free time and family time women generally prefer doing the latter women who have children who are working full time or in high end jobs are constantly giving their children to nannies to look after they dont have proper time to spend with their own children and raise them its unfair on the children,NOT
children isnt the only thing that skews the wage gap women chose lower paying jobs than men do,NOT
that it doesnt exist,NOT
i have noticed that the media outlet websites like the bbc for example that are so keen on drumming the gender wage gap story over  over again have disabledremoved the comments section on their socalled news articles why to stop people from being able to rebuff their lies a simple post with a link to this youtube video could educate so many people but oh no you cant do that you cant tell the truth or even just present the facts the science the logic anymore that is not allowed these days great video,NOT
i came here ready to disagree im so glad we are finally starting to address the real issue instead of focusing on a fake one,NOT
amazing thank you pbn for all you do to raise awareness  the year i became vegan  at almost   i will keep raising awareness for everyone  its well overdue we need to be vegan for the animals for the planet for our health there will be a day  where meatfishdairy will not be eatenits not a dream any longer veganism for life ,NOT

tldr  the wage gap is produced by womens choices not discrimination were it otherwise companies would only hire women to pay them less and save  on their labor costsduh,NOT
they are doing they thinglet them race with them girlsthey on the verge of being girls so hush,NOT
so its settled women get shitty degrees work shitty hours but expect a bigger pay check than men lmao tf,NOT
beyond burger kicks ass  soy free  gold,NOT
black transapes the left has lost all morality,ABU
i dont get why feminists and sjws think that they females get paid less because theyre females its because some people do better work then you do and are more efficient at it a wage gap is if you are as efficient as someone else and produce the exact same amount of work but you get paid less which is illegal therefor meaning no wage gap,NOT
trans formers more than meets the eye,NOT
what people miss is if business owners could get the same work for less money from women then every business would have all women employees this is how you know this myth is and has always been a lie things are just that simple so stop lying and stop complicating truths that are just that simple,NOT
have you seen her mess of an apology video i feel like shes not trolling anymore and it makes me really sad you should reach out to her and have like a conversation she needs help and i think whatever gender therapist shes seeing doesnt know wtf theyre talking about,ABU
cant wait for the waterworks in the next video bois,NOT
but dont they make as much because stereotypes convince or force them to do less paying jobs,NOT
men get paid more than women because men are more likely to get maimed killed do filthy or degrading jobs or work long hours than women its a fact i am a garbage man its filthy degrading and hard work but it pays good can women do it sure of course but you never do i wonder why,NOT
so many dislikes for a fairly neutral video i liked it vox informative,NOT

if there was a wage gap only women would be employed,NOT
i was also so proud but if you watch her snap chats shes seen eating chicken and nonvegan pizza people are saying its because the video is prefilmed and the two weeks are up can you ask her if she really stopped being vegan already,NOT
them guy do have unfair advantage yes they are boys and theyll never be anything else but that just with their disillusion of thinking they are girls,NOT
didnt the girl caster semenya from south africa get lots of opposition for hyperadroganism she is dominating women middle distance for sometime now n they stopped her for a while but shes at it again i think its very unfair,ABU
there is no wage gap women just pick jobs that dont pay as much,NOT
no extinction for you,NOT
when did you decide it was more appropriate for you to start competing against girls when i realized i wasnt fast enough to compete against the boys,ABU
carb the fuck up eat lots  lots of carbs daiya makes good dairy alternatives as well good job on making the change  good luck,NOT
two black girls go  and  when the actual black girls are in the back with the other biological girls trying to catch the transgendered black girls bad enough people call black women masculine now we have literal men posing as us,ABU
basically this relies on  reasons women dont ask for promotion women work fewer hours women prefer different jobs,NOT
shes a troll she likes the attention lol,NOT
