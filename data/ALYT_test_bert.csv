her face and attiude scream meath addict,1
i really try to be as loving and compassionate to all living things as possible but i really struggle with piers morgan,0
im so happy for you trish try to stay on this diet for as long as possible then you will notice the benefits,0

hey freelee can u please do a video on free range farms my family buys all there meat and eggs from them and i would love to learn about them and see if they are just as torturous as a normal factory farm,0
the vox should do a video on any people or groups tend to react so negatively to views that dont match their own maybe touching on behaviours line brigading on reddit groups like the redpill and even how many people are the believers and how many are just there to watch and encourage discord,0
check out mommytang  she is the best,0
its sad that we have to explain this to some people,0
just listen to your body if youre hungry eat if your not or if you are satisfied dont eat every vegan does it different so do what is working for you it doesnt have tone another youtubers diet if you are feeling fatigued try eating more carbs and less fats and of course drink lots of water,0
thank you for changing your self to love animals just remember ur beautiful and plz stay vegan plz,0
sexist videothe male workers work as the same as the women in a construction site next to my windowbut the woen get paod halfthey think thst women can plough less than menwhile the men are gossipingthe women are working double but getting paid halfsexist rule,0
idk what to do because i feel awkward because one of my best friends other bests friend is transgender and she transitioned like  weeks ago and i misgendered them bc i had no idea and now he hates me and my best friend thinks im a transphobe,0
she said median but its mean,0
this video is just making me so confused for her lmfao,0
yasss girl  i am so happy to hear this ,0
i was a on  off meat eater havent had it in months  dnt miss it but i wouldnt consider my a vegan  dnt like when ppl try  identify me as such cos i dnt totally agree with the things vegans eat i try to follow a dr sebi cell food diet which some would say is vegan but alot of the foods vegans eat arent cell foods  have the same bad effects on the body as meat eaters,0
i was forced to write a paper on this topic last year for school i received a failing grade because she said the facts that i found and used didnt match her opinion,0
maybe female scientists have less children,0
interesting how silly videos brought me here well glad they did because this has given quite the impression very educational and informative and these videos help me understand what makes the stupid people so stupid thumbs up,0
i have short hair and love it i wear men clothing and i am still not sure whenever i am heterosexual or bisexual it depends and changes with time but i always go back to asking myself questions and i am proud to say i am happy with my genderfemale and to troll people like trisha did thats honestly disgusting to watch i know some people speak before they think are more loud or have some problems with  attention seeking or even have an illness or are going through hard time and are confused but thats no excuse for her,0
so you prefilmed a video months ago cause you knew you were going vegan in the future for a video shoot you filmed this and wasnt going vegan for at least another month makes no sense but good for you to gie it a try hope you like it,0
check out fullyrawkristina and izzy also freelee works outalot so do most vegansthey do so much cardio if youre not into that much cardiostick to greens mostly and cut back on fruit sugars,0
ohmygodyesss this is amazing,0
ive been vegan for almost a month and i have never felt more physically and mentally healthier i used to always go off and on with a vegetarian diet but freelee was the final push i needed cowspiracy will turn anyone who watches it into a vegan its seriously eyeopening ,0
im crying here im so happy for you and freelee and the world  you go girl,0
 trish oh how exciting awesome good stuff you can do it blessings,0
women in my city make thousands of dollars a month babysitting or dogsitting not an exaggeration at all no college degree needed,0
hahahahahahahhahahahaha sorry i apologize let me clarify hahahahahahahahhahahahaha,0
making hours more flexible at a larger variety of jobs is better for both men and women who work i dont see why this is so controversial,0
why we need communism ,0
im just so freakin sick of people blaming their own poor choices on supposed influence grow a backbone  think for yourself you know i mean if the media tells you to gouge out your own eye are you gonna do it you would think the answer would obviously be no but somewhere some idiot is googling the best way to gouge out your eye,0
there is a difference between wage gap and earnings gap and feminists dont seem to know this,0
this is so hurtful you dont get to choose i am trans and its so invalidating to hear an influencer thats confused and who doesnt know who they are yet causing damage to the community people like you make the community look like joke im not saying you arent trans but you are confused and you need to do your full research people look up to you and its so rude for you to go on the internet and spread the wrong messages because youre not educated yourself,0
so they are a gender fluid hoe,1
just go look at her new ig post eating chicken and waffles,0
get rekt libtards,1
its simple women arent men,0
hey cut their junk off turn it from an outside to an inside plumbing then lets see how good they can run grandpa i told him to remember there are only men with breasts no woman with dicks and catelyn jener dosent change anything same rules courageous has not changed its meaning to shit for brains,1
when a femina makes this liked,0
this is awesome i hate having to say this but please go and talk about this girl sorsha on youtube she is a vegan but she is a bitch,1
welcome with open arms you mean everyone is forced to deal with this crap,1
wait i dont wear make up everyday and i dont do my hair am i a man now ,0
yo what the fuck,0
is it even a question this shit is unfairwhat the duck is wrong with you gma,1
good for you girl ignore all the vegan police out there the fact that youre even putting this out here as a decision is amazing you can eat all the food you wantfruits veggies potatoes rice grains beans etc dont calorie restrict yourself just eat until youre satisfied and dont forget to treat yourself wth vegan junk food sometimes love all your videosive been watching you for years and your videos always make my day love you and so proud youre giving veganism a shot,0
finally someone with common sense,0
the thing is women are just better at some stuff and men are better at some stuff id rather have a woman raise my child while i go bust my ass working construction to provide where is the argument,0
you can always ask joey for vegan advice i mean yall are good friends lol ily trish,0
trisha no after what people say you are beautiful in your own way god made you for a reason and if going vegan makes you happy do it dont listen to haters all you hates fuck off,0
there isnt a wage gap,0
so in other words the wage gap is an illusion,0
im starting to think you are just free advertising for chikfila,0
at pizza hut you can order no cheese on the pizza and add extra veggies  thank you for thinking of the animals,0
smdh yep the world is about to end take cover lol,0
thank goodness this video came out saw this video on womens page gap day,0
sfmh that trish girl went to the dark side ,0
she doesnt have gender dysphoria shes just an attention whore ,1
i mean sure its not good i guess that women on average make less but its not my fault as a male theres no conspiracy that every man is in on saying yeah we gotta pay women less cause theyre women muhaha,0
i knew i picked the right career,0
someone should let her go on t and see how she reacts to being a real man,0
oh my gosh yes,0
if woman do the same job as men they will get payed the same as this clearly proves that point its not because of sexism that woman can not make as much money,0
i got an ad for you on the video,0
i adore all the positivity on here this makes me so happy,0
i think trisha might truly need to take a look at her mental health,1
 gender identity and gender expression are different  we will never truly know if she is lying only she does  if you think shes lying dont give her any media attention  if you dont think her label is correct then its up to her to search for that correct label people can spend time questioning their sexuality and gender ps im not saying i believe her  just trying to be a critical thinker,0
 who is he ,0
im so happy for you,0
blair i dont think you could make an ugly face if you tried,1
theres so much more to life than money,0
i guess what makes people get negative the most is also the fact that she monetized all those videos including this last one today first one has two ads mil views aka at least k second one has three ads mil views aka around k and this last one has four ads which will no doubt reach a million views at least so all in all with those last three vids thats anywhere from k at the minimum to k all this in three days thats why people amongst other things but mainly i feel took it as oh just another clickbait troll stunt from trisha the chicken nugget she is who she is and usually id tell her she doesnt need to explain anything but this time it def got icky somehow and she has to take serious action to rectify the damage shes done i think she should be demonetizing those videos or better donating all the money from them to the lgbtq community with proof despite all i truly believe she cares about this community and that she didnt intend anything badthe only thing that could make me question that is her keeping that money  i think she is just a very dependant person who absorbs the personality of whoever is in her life at that time and who then has an identity crisis when that person gets out of her life its not necessarily a bad thing she could def turn this around be an award winning actress with what is originally a more negative personality traits lol but the girl needs to go away for a while alone on a vacation and concentrate on finding herself once and for all but thats just my long opinion ,0
if you can prove that women are underpaid even though they have same job same task same employer same hours same years of experiences same efficiency same company and the same productions then i will believe in wage gap,0
so proud eat tons of yummy food you got this,0
didnt last a week shes eating chicken and waffles on snapchat you deserve the goodness of being vegan and the amazing benefits it brings its sad you couldnt do it,0
you can be an ally without being trans trisha i get it its hard to know what is the right way to be supportive but thats why we watch channels like blaires blaire thank you for educating us and clearing up things that are difficult to understand i kinda get how trisha got confused though personally i did go through a phase where i wondered if i might be trans when i was a young teen but eventually i realized that i just dont like dressing in girly clothes or wearing make up that doesnt make me a trans man it just means i like being comfortable ,0
relatively close to zero is still not zero and still unjust,0
galina schatalova  research her works,0
finally some people talking sense about the wage gap,0
whole food has a lot of yummy vegan food and snacks my sister is vegan and she shops there all the time,0
literally eat like half a watermelon it so good watermelon spears are lame,0
they should just create a trans sport team to compete with other trans its totally unfair for them to be on the team for biological females this takes the chances of born females to advance and won for what theyve trained their lives for,1
ugh why cant these videos be longer,0
have fun with it trisha find what you like and try new things  happy for you,0
three years vegan,0
i think shes womansplaining at us,0
wwill you be giving up leather shoesbeltsclothes and handbags you cant eat chicken but you will happily wear animals,0
ok wtf i can not believe that i used to like her she just wants to be able to say i am part of the lgbtq community always wants attention,0
oh youre into gay guys wow thats you and damn near every other woman on earth for clarification watch shoe on head video on  questions women have for men in particular the point about why men are into lesbians,0
their muscles are glistening in the wind ,0
my phone is jacked and a faint outline of the was that a moment for you shirt has been at the side of this video and i am feeling that,0
boys against girls not fair,1
why focus in the fact that women need to have jobs with schedule flexibility man can increase their contribution with children too,0
that fuck wit women is just a money hungry bitch and now abusing the lgbti community to gain more views and cloutyes she is a troll ps loved ur piss take on her sitting on the kitchen floor and muk bang hahaha u go girl love ya blaire as,1
im going to be a single parent when i grow up and i can see myself having the same schedule as women do,0
im going vegan but i love avacado sandwiches and toast with coconut oil what do i do ,0
im so happy and excited for you  veganizm is the best choice people can get in their life trust me you are going to feel so good  look good,0
i wonder if she watches her videos before she posts them,0
this poor lost soul,0
blaire preach love,0
you remind me of this ,1
watch hot for foods youtube channel or lauren toyotas youtube channel they make amazing vegan meals,0
cheatingthis is so unfairthey should have a different categorythis is bs,1
okay i agreed with all of this apart from when you started talking about sam smith they have mentioned multiple times before coming out properly that they were non binary and have since and its clear they are and their not just doing it for clout because as well thats not the type of person they are,0
this argument is used so much that i just say men earn it,0
around  mins label must conform to the identity of the product  therefore the label fat guy with multiple chins conforms to the product meat eater who makes alot of money from the meat industry who looks like he is hypertensive and on statins which might confuse consumers who might mistakenly think he is a health slim athletic guy who doesnt make money from the meat industry ,0
what is wrong with competing with males i get it you feel like a girl trapped in a mans body but why compete in womens division that doesnt mean that the society doesnt accept who trans people are its just having a fair competition i mean steroids are illegal for a reason but they allow this hmmmm,1
i hate wearing makeup and never really glam up my hair welp according to trisha im trans,0
sis think its time to go visit shane and have a chat,0
yes queen spend money at chick fil a  the gays cant handle it,0
because it doesnt factor in the fact that women work less hours,0
they are boys they have male muscles society is so fucked up they look and sound like men hell they are men ridiculous,1
you should do a skincaremakeup routine video you are glowinggg,0
im seeing people telling you to just buy the vegan versions of nonvegan food thats totally fine but just make sure youre not eating that all the time avoid all the highly processed stuff btw if you have a good diet you dont really have to restrict calories,0
update trisha failed she posted on her snap chart a few days ago her shoving chicken and waffles down her throat and then dominos yesterday lol,0
id be sooooooo happy love you  im vegan and its really easy to transition,0
good informative video i think something that wasnt mentioned that could affect a womens wage is the likelihood of them taking time off or quiting their job all together i think men get paid more because they are much less likely to be out of work for children for maternity leave from a companys point of view its just more reliable to pick a man to do the job and in a general sense they are a more financially sound choice,0
i like how this video makes out like women suddenly out of nowhere get this horrible burden that is a child and have no choice but to take on a lot of the responsibility thats just what mothers do mom takes care of the kids if theyre sick dad picks up an extra shift mom goes to the recital dad picks up an extra shift ez,0
the only thing that i learned from this video is that scientists work self directed and i want to become one know,0
vegan sausage rolls you mean corn roll if why it is so unhealthy why try to create food you are against eating just have a steak,0
men are better stronger faster,0
trisha bringing back the yes im a vegan yes i eat meat we exist meme except on a whole other level lmaoooo,0
seriously so so proud of her,0
trisha has to be taking the piss cute kitty btw,0
trisha im trans me im done,0
i had vegan burger before it was good alittle soft tho but other then that it was good i think vegan is the future definitely humens evolve so so should the food we eat too,0
try the app is it vegan you can search foods or scan the barcode and it will let you know if its vegan,0
the biggest lie by omission of the gender wage gap is that it does not take into account the fact that men work more hours than women so in other words women are getting less money for fewer hours of work which is as it should be,0
just coz  dudes grow their hair long and wax doesnt mean that their girls at all whats wrong with the world,1
what the actual fuck,0
this will be the first generation where someone will explain that their grandmother died of testicular cancer dave attell,0
get ready for a sitonthefloor crying video in a couple days,0
these comments bout funny as hell,0
in the coming years i wonder how society will account for the emerging trans community in these economic models will it fix the issues or make them worst,0
you should look up deviousdemi she always has healthy meals and shows how she puts them together and exercises high carb hannah mommytang shes on a diet recently so her recipes might help kalel as you mentioned theres hotforfood not exactly healthy but good to check out vegan zombie not exactly healthy do not over eat you have to eat until youre satisfied if youre not working out like crazy high intensity freelees way of eating will not help you it potentially could actually make you gain weight and feel overly full and turned off to eating vegan due to the high volumes she eats no hate on her just pointing out theres more than just the freelee way that could suit you better,0
well for protein fruits actually contain protein but not as much as you need so i suggest beans beans give one of the best proteins everrrr and im just so glad that at least you learned how abusive humans are towards animals and its just so sad that we kill animals in their own home,0
ur gender fluid u need someone in the community to guide u with the right terminology because all the stuff ur saying is wrong and im not reading u im just saying even tho as a transgender woman myself u need to find u and not be confused with what ur doing,0
check pewdie pew new video about vegan,0
definitely try gardine and boca those two are amazing beans and veggies are great for protein  good luck trish,0
so if i identify has a transgender i can join girls ufc im about to be rich,0
wondering these are males who wear makeup and grow their hair long and act like a girl and bianca is not very bright winning metals is not something everyone can do so how your feel and winning a metal are completely different,1
i am sorry you have mutilated yourself and lost your mind,1
 feminist dont like de video ,0
of course both of these transgendered boys well they have not transitioned so they are boys would say that it is not fair for them because they are not thinking of others but want everyone to think about their situation which they chose us women were born women and had to fight to title ix and respect in the sports field while they are taking advantage of the fact that they are still male physically something else us women have to fight against,0
this is an all time low for her being unkempt and makeup free does not make you trans,0
it doesnt exist,0
my fave vegan foods fries for protien bbq tofu chia seeds,0
im no heterosexual but i still think and feel like this is very unfair all of the observable science points to that fact you can literally find more testosterone in those dudes than the other ladies out there like wth im so confused and to all of the leftist out there shouldnt you be supporting women from toxic masculinity to the equality of the sexes there are so many contradictions i dont get it are you just trolls or am i really missing something is this a joke or what i am so confused,0
okay so they are men who identify as women and use hormones which allows them to compete against women or people who identify as women im so confused,0
christina hoff sommers is a badass,0
am i a gay man yes  am i a chicken nugget yes ,0
people cant take a joke ruunnn alphabet community is coming for u,0
i showed this to a feminist and she literally went back to her rants on facebook,0
please dont kill me are there vegan eggs what do you use instead of eggs,0
trish this is so amazing im so excited for you from one vegan to a now vegan in my opinion any reason to change your diet to veganism is a good reason i went mostly for ethical reasons but losing weight and toning up happens regardless if youre trying this out for two weeks in order to feel a little slimmer for your shoot try to only drink water lemon water will help a ton to lose bloating that might occur when increasing your vegetablefruit intake eat when youre hungry please please do not restrict freelee is right you can eat as much as you want if youre eating a plant based diet raw or not the first week you might be a little gassy or a little bloated but dont let this discourage you by the end of week two your body will have adapted a lot more to the new diet so you should be waking up looking nice  tight i hope you see this as i want you to be successful in this as it can be a total and complete game changer quinoa  beans and any dark green vegetable will be high in protein i encourage you to look up vegan recipes to play around with its fun and dont be afraid to try different vegan restaurants in your area they can open your eyes as to how wonderful food on this lifestyle can be good luck trish and keep digging around youtube and the internet for vegans that inspire you muah xx,0
trish this is great news going vegan can be really hard at first so dont beat yourself up and give up on veganism if you make mistakes i made mistakes when i first went vegan such as accidentally eating parmesan cheese on my spaghetti at a restaurant and eating sour cream that was mixed in with guacamole its okay just pick yourself and carry on what matters is that youre trying dont just eat fruits and vegetables though i recommend morning star garlic and quinoa vegan burgers on a bun with lettuce tomato onion ketchup and sour cream get some cans of chick peas they are delicious and hummus and pita bread its so good you can make a great meal with hummus on bread with fresh veggies they also have vegan frozen pizzas that you can sprinkle vegan cheese shreds on it make smoothies in the mornings or have toast with vegan butter bagels with pbj the options are endless please dont just eat fruits and veggies and starve yourself and give up on veganism good luck we support you,0
this is so wrong but  the trans girl with the highlights is very very pretty im not gay but i think shes a beautiful girl,0
you didnt take into account the dirty jobs like garbage collectors or high risk jobs like police or firefighter women dont want to do these jobs and the high salary of these jobs due to how gross and how dangerous they are make the gap bigger men are more willing to take life threatening jobs than women just because they pay more and help them support their families is also why of every  work related deaths  of them are men,0
you can do this i believe in you and so many others do too so happy and proud of you yesssss there are so many great amazing reasons to go vegan u got this ,0
 is the same as  lulz,0
freelee is gonna go insane ,0
some milli vanilli lookin mfer,1
go to youtube channel the vegan corner,0
when the feminists push for trans rights and then support girls being beaten in every sport by them hats off to you for cornering yourself well done,0
shut up rd way femnazi lieing butt face,0
for the love of all that is good stop using that vocal fry could not watch more than  minutes because of that voice cracking,1
i cant believe progressives are out and about denying literal facts and yes they are facts check out my most recent video for more info,0
girl you look extra hot in this,0
im vegetarian and i want to go vegan but in stockton where im from theres not much options ive never actually went vegan before so like i dont know all the rules and stuff dont know anything about going vegan so i kind of need you to educate me,0
woah this is offensive to actual trans people ahah,0
while youre in a vegan diet you cannot eat all the calories you want freelee is very wrong in that specially if youre only doing it for  weeks just letting you know ,0
biologically born girl  ive worked and ive trained for most of my life i think i deserve a fair chance transgender  no but my feelings,1
your vegan diet will last as long as your relationships,1
there is a wage gap its cuz women dont work as many hours,0
im happy you took the step there are plenty of helpful resources out there for you to stay on track and dont forget to stay inspired by new recipes i have plenty on my channel  ,0
a little late for this video dude,0
i think shes uneducated and manic,0
its weird that women are often penalized for getting pregnant its how the species continues folks,0
the fact it does not exist,0
they can do what they want but not at the expense of the girls ,0
in trisha snapchat shes back to eating meat this is a old ass video or a favor video,0
this was so awesome it gave me chills,0
vegans are so over dramatic ,0
well didnt really work out did it showing those chicken fingers the other day when youve been with sean,0
this is ridiculous  born a man you are biologically a man its not rocket science jeez,0
the vegan vlog was more than a month ago its just for viewssadly ,0
am i the only one beyond excited to see freelees response to this btw yay trisha so happy for you,0
here are my tips for you the most important tip is to eat until you get full do not try and eat as much as freelee you will feel sick  keep it simple  dont try to follow in sort of guidelines what i mean by this is do not eat a bunch of raw foods because its not pm yet  if following raw till  trust me you will end up over eating because you didnt have what you are craving just about everything can be made vegan if you get a craving have a little bit for example i crave pizza chocolate waffles etc what i do is look up vegan recipes where to find those vegan teams and eat them if i crave chocolate i buy the bar and i eat a square or two and then tuck it away for a rainy day  while any exercise is good exercise i recommend you do a little more than normal ex taking a morning walkjog as well as dancing  educate yourself it well help you build a deeper connection that way you stay on track if you get off track get back on youre gonna do great,0
ye but men dont take tasks for their tasks because you cant when i was younger my dad couldnt come to my matches or to the store with me because his boss didnt let him he let woman working with him do so but not men of cource men are going to get more money if they cant leave work to spend time with their children he couldnt be with me most weekends so of course he got more money if mens jobs are less flexible then they are going to work more therefore gain more,0
when you see them run its so obvious that they physically have an advantage as a result of their biological gender all for them being transgender but i would be upset too,0
they fail to explicitly attempt to answer in detail why women make less thats the video we need,0
theres such thing as a gender therapist get one,0
the stat that said that women still did the majority of child care despite both parents being in full time jobs my initial thoughts were  how many hours overtime is the man doing  what are the couples professions is one say a receptionist and one is an industrial engineer it was not stated but elsewhere in the vid it shows that woman as a group earn less per year than a man so you can infer that the full time woman is still probably working less hours in a lower paid job than her husband that said both parents should take a more equal role in child rearing than still seems the case today,0
this is embarrassing,0
leftists lack any common sense,0
u go gurl im so happy youre doing this not only are you helping your body by eating the right stuff but youre also helping the planet luv u boo,0
this is so so amazing i just hope people dont beat her up if shes not  vegan from the start and scare her away because this is so important,0
you know she wont last two weeks ,0
veggie grill is soooooo good try it,0
based mom ftw,0
please dont get too excited because this isnt going to last,0
im personally not vegan im a vegetarian but i do watch a lot of vegan and raw vegan youtubers brianna jackfruitson nickacado avacado kalel simply quinoa supreme banana just to name a few for foods id recommend brianna the most she has so many raw vegan meals that can easily be cooked she was fully raw for the longest time and started getting into cooked foods again theres nothing wrong with being raw but there is definitely more variety as a vegan than a raw vegan youre the best trish  i hope you stick to the diet for a while and i know you can do it,0
shes trolling or someone put something in her head there can be a lot going on,0
this is going to destroy womens sports,1
trisha potato is a complete idiot,1
yesss im so happy for u trish be sure to have lots of grains also dont be discouraged in the beginning if you gain little bit of weight because your body is getting used to the metabolism from the vegan diet but eventually youll start dropping the pounds a lot when i went vegan i am lost  pounds within the first two weeks so but i was vegetarian first so it was a little healthier than a carniat so just be aware that you might gain a little bit at first but then youll start shedding off the weight nonstop good luck,0
dem niggaz are boys,1
remember when you said you were a lesbian,0
just make a league for trans already,1
you faked being lgbt once why would you think we would believe you a second time,0
this video was so long ago tho,0
fortunately most people are becoming accepting of the reality of the fact that we take life solely to fulfill our greediness though there are still those emotional whiny carcass crunchers that double down in their ignorance lmao those are the people that would have been slave owners back in the day same exact mentality and just like before natural selection will weed those less aware individuals out as society progresses without them,0
the wage gap does not exist before i watch this,0
cant beat the boys dress up like a girl and beat them what is not understood about their clear advantage,1
stfu they took st and nd respectively lmao bc two boys racing a bunch of girls and beating them is winning respectively,1
to be honest before i clicked i thought it would be ben shapiro,0
this needs to be played on national television,0
being a primary caregiver is not a disease nor is anyone forced into it ask any of them those choose to be the primary caregiver because thats what they want raising children is a team exercise and there is nothing wrong with divvying up the responsibilities nor is it atall honest to theyre both working full time so they should be the same because theyre not men on average work a hell of a lot more hours even among full time workers,0
right right i forgot i chose to be payed less doesnt it seem kinda coincidental that the jobs dominated by women are the ones that get payed less,0
 the year i got my health back,0
absolutely ridiculous if you wanna look like a girl fine but you are not girls especially at sports this is why the coming generations will have to request birth certificates so they wont be tricked by these people when dating i feel sorry for the parents of the real girls that have to compete against them and just sorry for the parents of these ,1
 i feel personally attacked,0
i stopped eating meat almost  months ago my view on meat has changed so much i dont even think its normal to eat meat anymore i mean even if the animal had an amazing life youre still eating a dead slaughtered animal its fucking gross in my opinion anyway follow hot for food and jessbeautician for food inspo  also hollie wakeham,0
ohkay so first argument the choice one you are saying that first the people oppress and condition women to  take care of children and not do a job at all and then if they decide they enforce the idea of so called the job of a woman now this people is the real illusion of choice stop thinking aliens are controlling us first fight this oppression then well develop weapons against those aliens this is part one ill post comments as i see the video and give arguments,0
ur an idiot,0
i dont know why people take her so seriously its clear shes a troll shes admitted to being a troll but people continue to make reaction videos to her strange statements which is the exact attention she wants,0
i mean i def think non binary is a thing it just wasnt as ubiquitous until recently or it can be a safe stepping stone for some people on the journey to discover how they want to present and live their life that being said trisha doesnt seem to really understand what it means to be trans or what it means to be nonbinary but thats just my opinion,0
reminds me alot of cars ,0
even the incorrectly calculated wage gap is closing fast way more women go to college than men and women are getting married and having kids later and later every year to focus on their careers more the truth is business was extremely unfriendly to women like  years ago and its been getting progressively better since then one day women will probably make more than guys do the way the education system is going but these things take time they dont happen overnight,0
piers morgan is human trash,0
imagine downvoting facts,0

we are changing gods creation in gods  commandments one of the most important is to not kill if we are supporting the killing of other beings then we are supporting acts that are not holy i have never hurd such stupidity than i have with ppl that stand by the cruel acts that will leave us no planet or existence for there own unjustifiable behavior,0
this is bad journalism more trans athletes perform above average then below or at the biological changes are not confirmed to the more fiat then muscle the didnt mention the trans mma male turned female who obliterated her opponents fair huh abc did present facts to case but did also twist to a social trend and not ethical in any way good morning america has also bombed the journalism mark by doing the same time and time again by presenting elements of a story to fit the scheme not the story at hand,0
the ending just made my life im so excited for   lets gooo,0
here after the did video my first reaction after watching both videos and after not watching any of her videos in yeaaaarrrs is what the actual fuckbut honestly this makes me so sad there is obviously something really wrong with her she has absolutely no idea who she is or where she belongs and this in it self is a problem  most likely started when she was a child as much as we all want to hate on her the poor girl is literally losing her mind in front of millions and making millions in the process its a vicious and unfulfilling circle and i hope the people who actually care for her will keep an eye on her,0
you also forgot to add things like working overtime between men and woman,0
even if you dont stay vegan after the  weeks much respect for giving it a go  as for diet advice ideally you would track your calories so you dont under eat too much or over eat usually people under eat on a vegan diet rice pasta potatoes beans lentils chickpeas vegetables mock meats mock cheeses violife etc not sure whats available for you non dairy milk i like almond milk myself fruit is also great however i disagree that you can eat as many calories as you like take a b supplement i take veg which has vitamin d and others too good luck,0
i have no comment because the people pushing this will be the one eventually who will reverse it not playing this game,0
what the actual fuck is going on here,0
im so proud of you trisha,0
ok but since when did we start taking trisha seriously,0
i get me some vegan trash fastfood and plant oils to feel healthy thanks veganism really did some innovations,0
first video i have ever seen you look stunning,0
she knows there is nonbinary right,0
i see why jason left her shes fucking batshit i swear to god,1
one question do you experience gender dysphoria if not you literally cannot be trans without it as thats what tells your brain that youre not in the right body,0
so if shaq said he was a woman he could play in the wnba and nobody would have a problem with it,1
i thought u identified as a chicken nugget,0
veganism is not the answer,0
get rid of the fair pay act,0
niomi smart has amazing recipes,0
great video  much love from switzerland freelee ,0
finally an big conservative account that isnt being censored,0
vegan gains brought me here ,0
thats really great freelee ,0
i want to talk about this at school but i know my whole school will turn on me,0
i have a crazy theory women dont ask for raises as often or as loudly as men my extremely competent wife earned less than some of the people she was managing she thought this was okay because theyd been at the bank longer than she had i was unconvinced by that argument and i suspect a higher proportion of men than women agree with me,0
stop growing grain stop feeding grain to animals stop eating grain im guessing this film is just another propaganda film promoting vegan,0
i got a wealth ad before this,0
thank you for not jumping to the conclusion that it is discrimination or oppression like sjwsthe wage gap in specific careers really boils down to flexibility in hoursand women focusing on children is often the result of interplay between couples or lack of couples a lot of mothers would rather be the primary caregiver rather than the father it does not mean that the men are lazy how dare those dads not raise kids more or the mothers are lazy how dare those moms focus on the easy task of raising kids of instead of nonchild care chores and work its just their preferences,0
we did it freelee ,0
why dont you just identify as nonbinary so you can be in the gray area of gender and transition whatever way you choose to instead of identifying as trans because what youre describing doesnt sound like transgender,0
wow be careful with all the statistics and factual numbers facts might hurt someones feelings,0
yeah and what if for ethical reasons you dont want to be a petroleum engineer but want to devote your life to community organization you will probably contribute more to society for a fraction of the wages this still sucks,0
also a good snack is peanut butter toast with fruit for the milk substitues there is coconut almond cashew etc trisha you wont gain weight if you stop eating when you are satisfied you will lose so much weight and in a healthy way if you over eat on any diet you will gain weight so dont be scared ,0
more women graduate college than men close the education gap,0
i wish i new this earlier because my class is mostly girls and they all had a  minute talk about this,0
ive been waiting on this d,0
im bisexual girl and ive been attracted to straight girls so does that make me a straight man,0
get this girl some lithium asap,0
stupid feminist pigs,0
shes a troll just like you said shell be onto the next trend once it rolls out no matter how ridiculous lol,0
vegan for  months now my skin has never been more clear eat plant based for a few months and see if it works for you,0
the wage gap is a myth,0
aww good for h trisha,0
wait what this is new i didnt know she said this what the heck,0
yayyy shes finally going vegan wd and gl x,0
i am allergic to certain fruits so if i were vegetarian would that be better than nothing i feel like it would be so much easier to do that going straight to being a vegan im not even a fan of meat that much anyway but since everyone is becoming vegan and i feel like even just not eating meat isnt good enough i just want to be able to eat other things since i cant eat some fruits,0
trisha isnt going vegan she was just stuffing her face at the cheesecake factory last weekend she made that video for views surprise surprise,0
im sorry but this video is misleading it does however kind of show how even with years of data and statistics you can manipulate the truth,0
gotta say chickfila has some of the best lemonade ever,0
youre missing carbs,0
im  and slow as molasses but i identify as the olympic  yard dash winner wheres by gold medal,0
go watch nina and randa they are vegan and do what i eat in a day they could really help you find foods to eat,0
i like this video it makes me feel better,0
i want freelee to be my personal trainer  this shit is hard ,0
i think the term youre looking for to describe what you are is a human being,0
i am so thankful that she is telling the feminists that there incompitant trend followers,0
freelees old videos are good you just have to start at  and work your way forward in time til early ,0
i just watched fridge to farm cried and sick to my stomach im going to try my best to go vegetarian vegan i know i wont be touching meat dairy again for a long timeif ever,0
girl no youre not,0
is there any scientific proof for a correlation between the wage gap and the flexibility of the job,0
trish buy more vegetables marinate or find recipes of oil free sauces they are even less dense than fruits and you can chow on them all day without feeling guilty or deprived which makes you want unhealthy vegan food,0
a good vegan snack is coconut bites theyre at sams club i ate the entire bag in  days sooooo good,0
you can still be a girl and be more masculine ever hear of a tomboy you dont have to be a girly girl just cause youre a girl i think you shouldve gotten professional help before making this video youre all over the place i mean you are what you are you know you better than anyone else but  okay trish,0
they forgot that men work longer hours take less holidays and that  work deaths are men because men go into high risk work high reward oil rigs tree surgeons etc,0
trish this is huge so happy for you xxxx,0
i could never i would eat a cheese burger real quick,0
nothing is funnier and more depressing than the men who reject this,0
im soooooo triggered,0
which men and women earns k out of business lmao wtf,0
trishs lips look weird like this weird brown color like she just got done rimming someone what the f,1
there is probably still some left over wage gap from previous generations where men have more experience and are the older segment of the labor force that earns more but the strongest argument is the first argument capitalism cant afford to be racist or sexist or else someone would have a company that only hired women and would have  more profits,0
i really really really think trisha is a bit smarter than we make her out to be she understands how to get clicks and traffic to her channel no such thing as bad publicity and i really think she is making fun of how crazy and trendy some people are with identities i see her video as a parody but she wont say that cause she already has bad backlash coming her way,0
she goes through phases of obsessions and this is one of them but hey the bitch is making money with all the views she gets on her madness hahahah,0
it is illegal for employers to discriminate based on sex,0
mommytang is a vegan youtuber and she always talks about vegan advice recipes etc shes great i love her,0
bruh im average asf and i smoked most of girls seniors included as a freshman testosterone is pretty much a legal steroid,0
beans tofu and broccoli have lots of protein  and zero cholesterol,0
oh here we fucking go,0
can i have the links to the websites that you used so that i can show them the websitez when im asked for proof i can list them,0
i love you freelee,0
nice sensible video for once good arguments make for a healthier debate instead of uneducated fools running their mouths,0
 nickelback  look at this graph,0
i wish people could just get along and have decent conversations feminists or not trying to one up each other and prove each other wrong will get us no where,0
oh my god thank you for making this a bout time someone explained this to people,0
i just cant believe how brainwashed we have become by mediawhen i started watching this movie i felt like this i love animals but i love meat moreand now i have realized how bad meat is for mein the past i was always trying to go vegan but i would always failand now i will slowly transition and try my best as always,0
great class  beautiful voice,0
there is vegan cheese you can have and the brand morning star has some great meatless meat options that are delicious,0
ouch thats a lot of dislikes not surprised but,0
well her choice to be vegan didnt last very long just saw her eating chicken and waffles on her sc story honestly im so sick of trishas shit,0
transgenders are abnormal only stupid white liberals will defend this the black liberals are even dummer for listening to the white ones of course a women principal would allow this real men are not liberal go to your safe spaces u stupid liberals,1
well it looks like these two will manage to get free college do to their athletic ability just another scam ,1
you can make burritos with rice beans cashew sour cream guacamole and cooked onions it is really good,0
friends caring about other friends health i love it it would be cool to see you collab with bindi irwin ,0
i love that trish is going vegan u go girl ,0
props for eating chikfila,0
if women get paid less than men wouldnt all companies fire as many male employees as possible and replace them with women so they can enjoy huge economical benefits,0
michael strahan doesnt believe that shit for a minute he played in the nfl imagine a girl coming in at quarterback he definitely knows its not fair,1
this is so amazing ,0
every time trisha gets kinda irrelevant she makes a weird video and she becomes relevant again if crying on the kitchen floor doesnt work anymore she suddenly becomes transgender d haha brilliant,0
did vox just admit that the wage gap exists due to the choices of women and not sexist discrimination do they realize that this means the wage gap is a non issue,0
how many people got eye cancer watching this,0
lesson if you want to earn more money dontt have kids,0
too many trees is the problem also monocropping and eating plants that also fs up our world idiots eating sugar all day lol grow up,0
glad to see a woman narrating this video,0
maybe you are genderqueer idk,0
why cant they put this transgender to compete against other transgenders if theres none then this transgender can find another sport to do like cheerleading or swimming if ya have a problem with what im saying you guys can kiss my ass because i aint discriminating nobody and im allowed to express my opinions,1
literally the best video ive ever watched,0
you know what today identify as a hamster cant tell me anything cause thats cruelty to animals ,0
the only way trisha is ever going to lose weight is to have someone who previously took the time to thoroughly learn and understand what is actually healthy to be with her  and smack the bad food out of her hands being vegan is a huge step in the right direction but it isnt necessarily going to take off a lot of extra weight there are vegans and then there are healthy vegans,0
shes not trans shes thirsty,0
how does one go from a lesbian to a trans gay male tf,0
 seconds in and my jaw dropped,0
trisha has also came out as a chicken nugget,0
im not sure shes faking she seems to want to be anything but who she is so shes looking for a way to be able to tolerate living in herself her body she blasted her boobs and lips and hair up to be happy as a woman that didnt help her so she tried finding solutions in identity irregularities shes deeply depressed i think and needs help otherwise id be surprised to see her alive  years from nowwhich i find sad since i dont think her character is horrible well see,1
ps maybe its race,0
wowtwo biological males kicking ass in womens sports who would have guessed this would happen,1
ooooo i was waiting for this onnnneeeee,0
wait why does it matter if women work less and in turn earn less than their husbands in order to take care of kids if they have a joint bank account and everything,0
girl good for you eat a lot of rice and veggies,0
they use the word brave tooooo loosely,0
currently in my campus gender wage gap is nearly nonexistent but that might be because its a little progressive,0
this video was prefilmed this bitch isnt going vegan lol it lasted like  day if you follow her on snapchat you know she just went out to dinner  she ate chicken fingers so yes this is yet again click bait ,1
what people miss about the gender wage gap it does not exist,0
ill take these facts on the chin for now but i would like to see references put either in the video or underneath it so i could look up the facts and quotes myself,0
 million people think vegans are insane assholes now because of your youtube daughter sorsha congrats,0
wait so vox is uploading this but continues to upload ish bit contradicting,0
you can tell how old trishs vids are by her nailslove her,0
they are men xx woman xy male you cant change science,1
its odd that you never hear anyone ever talk about the fact that in the porn industry women actors are paid about ten times as much as men actors for doing the same job,0
this shouldnt even be a debate regardless of which gender you identify as it doesnt change the scientific fact that  genetically speaking  men are predominantly stronger than women therefore to deny that someone who was born a male has an unfair advantage competing against women is ridiculous i dont make the genetic rules they just are what they are and for the record im happy for this kid if she is living the life she wants to live if shes happy thats all that matters but you cannot deny scientific facts and expect people to agree with you,0
there is no wage gap women work less,0
this is liberal garbage ive been eating meat everyday for most of my life and i cant get protein from celery sticks and carrots besides animals dont know theyre being slaughtered and cave men used to eat meat too bad this is the thought process of many people who are addicted to animal products,0
did it have a stroke her face is all stroked out,1
 its a myth,0
another choice communism,0
why is trisha taking up freele out of nowhere smells like a big pile of ,1
so happy to see this welcome to the family ,0
when you have no content left,0
at least somebody has made an effort to get the facts out stupid celebrities and their sheep,0
women make it up in divorce and child custody,0
the gender wage gap pales in comparison to the wage gap for workers with disabilities workers with disabilities earn for every dollar their nondisabled colleagues make  so yeah the gender wage gap sucks but the disability wage gap is a travesty,0
nope nope unfair,0
im here just awaiting ,0
talk about synchronicity i decided  to go vegan right at the end of  its not a choice its a requirement ive been quasi vegetarian for years eating usually plant based meals but still enjoying meat and fish occasionally and dairy as a staple but just before new year i saw among other ghastly footage of cruelty and indignity a visionbite of a small animal being tortured and killed for the the food predilections of the chinese and that image has stayed excruciatingly present in my mind it seemed to me that the animal was asking me as i looked straight into her bewildered dying eyes in a moment of direct contact through the camera lens to be kind to be aware to aid and support the life of the world not eat it the goddess looked at me through those eyes eyes that were saying goodbye i cannot unsee or unhear her message so im taking up that request,1
i was expecting a video blaming the patriarchy god i hate that word for oppressing women by decreasing their salaries but this video presented a really good very wellproven argument yet another great vox video but i have a question someone in the comments mentioned that in some countries like india schedule flexibility isnt the or the biggest cause of the gender gap  they didnt present any proof but i was hoping that someone who knows about the topic could clear it up,0
i just chose to identify as a boy lmao bitch no im sorry you re not trans,0
i literally cry every year at these weve come so far but have such a far way to go,0
isnt chick fil a antilgbtq,0
im so proud of you trish  i really hope that you are doing this for you and to feel better in yourself and not for anybody else because you are already so perfect stay true to yourself ,0
this bitch lost her mind why is she say that now,1
im not vegan but this is amazing,0
and lefties still claim theres a wage gap,0
prageru is my hero now,0
and i am wearing black as i am mourning my last  brain cells mood,0
sorry but trisha is a gigantic troll,0
another great video blaire i look forward to your videos they have become the highlight of my week ever since ive subbed to your channel,0
what if i kinda dont mind being a guy in a way but i prefer and want to present myself as female am i still considered trans,0
vox was a different place in ,0
wasnt this video recorded weeks ago when she was going to the internet famous premier am sure that was way more than two weeks ago,0
january  will be year  for me,0
yeeeeeah you are making a huge difference by this its so easy to be vegan for me high carb low fat is easy and works,0
fohthis is some crazy shitwe embarrass and destroy ourselves,1
feminists nowadays man,0
hi pbn im from taiwan ive translated this film and added the traditional chinese subtitle it took me several days to complete the translation  could you help me to review and approve my translated content so i can share this film to friends in taiwan thanks ,0
any time someone brings up the wage gap i just get reminded of how ignorant our society is ,0
feeling the hate on the dislikes lgbt community is this what you wanted no then be human and stop cheating yes youre womenbut youre women with all the advantages of having a mans body notfair,0
i went to a very good high school but it was soooo politically biased my junior english teacher and history teacher in high school were and are best friends extremely intelligent women and now great mothers but they were also the type of feminists to project any information that made them mad even if it wasnt entirely true the wage gap misconception was definitely the most glaring of those offenses by teaching all of their students this misconception both my history class and english class got into debates about feminism also because it was relevant to the curriculum and people used this wage gap as their base of support that showed the inequality among men and women in the workplace today in the process my school basically trained a bunch of smart kids to not think critically and just assume statistics were true or false based on if it agrees with their political views or not clearly this video proves that the wage gap many of my friends and teachers had in mind is not real but is in the form of a much more reasonable statistic if one was to actually look further into the data instead of getting excited about the it thinking it is true and then ignoring the critical thinking process because they want the information to be true all because it supports their cause while i do believe that there should be equality in the workplace there is no way that we can ignore what is actually causing much of the inequality in average pay to sum up this huge comment thank you vox and everyone involved with this video for creating a piece related to feminism with good critical and analytical thinking skills instead of spewing incredibly biased and false feminist stories while you made a lot of feminists look bad for yelling wrong information at people for so long you also made the movement look much better because you acknowledged as a very feminist channel that something many feminists believe is true is not thanks again,0
when you make cake instead of eggs you can use applesauce or banannas,0
as an antifeminist myself i think this is a great video,0
why some people think this is normalif you cant make babies or dont have ovaries and was born male guess whatyou still a male regardless how you feel or what you think or how many surgeries you do to your bodyplain and simple,0
there a lots of other factors you skipped over women typically work fewer overtime hours and use more of their vacation and sick days the whole wage gap basically boils down to the choices people make and not their gender,0
some of ya lookin tasty tonight,0
trish i had hair on my body during puberty therefore shes a man,0
uhits kinda against the law to pay someone less because of their gender what wage gap,0
what the idea that women make  cents on the dollar less than men is false shocker,0
those two guys barely beat the girlsembarrassing,1
muscles glistening in the wind  ,0
the bitch also came out as a chicken nugget,0
video provides a reasonable explanation why statistically wage gap is a thing and how it works kneejerks  second into the video post wage gap doesnt exist or this and that niche proffesion pay women more than men and close the video,0
ah yes finally someone who shows the truth there is no wage gap women are just lazy get off your ass and go for those jobs want to have a child well you better be able to work during your delivery if you want to match the work of your coworkers  sexual harassment stop making excuses about why you cant get promoted a male dominated industry for decades well i guess women havent been trying hard enough for decades ps for the morons or the ignorant this is sarcasm,0
vegans vs americans and their bellies,0
i have no respect on them i have more respect on the story of a gay muai thai fighter who competed on men division and whoops their ass now that is real strength and not this western ideology bullshit in fact it was even adapted into movie entitled beautiful boxer you should watch it its an awesome movie about gay which kinda not known in western side of the world,0
they are still men they should not compete against real women,1
i have been vegetarian for almost two years my goal this year is to be completely plant based im super excited i not only feel better when i dont eat meat or dairy but happy knowing that a precious animals life was not taken for such a selfish reason i have always loved animals but not eating meat has really opened my eyes to how beautiful and pure these creatures are they deserve better and i talk to so many people about not eating meat i only hope to help change peoples lifestyle that are destroying this beautiful planet we have,0
whole food vegan since  and still going strong at  best decision ever,0
well if you feel girly some days and like a boy other days then you might be genderfluid basically how i can explain it is sometimes you feel like a girl and other times you feel like a boy,0
girl i know youre not putting your dollar into chik fil a they openly hate the lgbtq community we can do better,0
vox not being raging leftists i am doubtful of the underlying motive,0
maybe if you cant go vegan for life try going vegetarian,0
oh my now farming is causing global warming  year study i smell horseshit this is nothing more than new age hipsterflat earth propaganda,0
prageru does a great video on it too,0
your body will not transform in  weeks no matter what kind of diet you go on this crash diet thing will do way more harm to your body than good stop doing it seriously,0
these women  are men,0
if youre a feminist and you are spouting this women earn c for every man dollar argument youre either an idiot who doesnt know what theyre talking about or youre not an idiot you know the truth and you still knowingly use these garbage statistics to manipulate people into your cause i dont know which is worse either way as soon as someone mentions it i just check out,1
bruh you ever heard of gender fluid,0
impaulsive made it ,0
hey trisha please watch the vegan drama on youtube  freelee and durianrider bullying smaller vegans channels vegan cheetah vegan lass joe vegan and many more their bullshit cult is sick,0
gurl ure not trans,0
let me show you my reaction has liked and watched beforehand,0
freelee please check out cenk hoca he is working toward the opposite of what you are he has no good reasoning and his video that i watched was f vegans and their stupid ideologies,0
beans rice potatoes sweet potatoes tomatoes corn watch vegan gains video to you that might help also trader joes is a great place to get produce frozen bags of fruit and veggies are great too,0
those that claim for the same work women earn  cents on the dollar compared to men on the other hand are not only bad at math but at telling the truth applause,0
honestly at one point it was c then c now c make up your damn mind,0
what happened to trisha she looks so baaaad,0
michael strahan sitting there like gma making me do this bullshit i can understand where they might be coming from but its unfair they might be transgender but they are more naturally male they just on the womens team cuz theyd get their ass beat in a boys race i mean if you argue this is fair then you can argue its fair for a horse to run in the m at the olympics cuz he thinks hes a human,0
if trish is trying to be veganmaybei can too,0
my brain just imploded ,0
trisha correct me if im wrong but i believe you are describing gender fluidity you said that you identify as transgender  and you identify with your natural born gender  it is more than okay to feel like you dont fit into just one gender label but just because you relate more to gay men does not mean you are transgender it goes much farther than that please educate yourself about the lgbtq trish,0
vox would never make a video like this in  theyre really far left now,0
god determines what you do in life and has decide you to be boys we just live in liar everyday,1
you and i definitely have the same views when it comes to animals i cry every time i see one of those videos because theyre so innocent and have no voice i hate it ,0
what people miss about the gender wage gap it doesnt exist the end  second long video,0
yes someone who tells the truth on this matter the differences are due to mindset and decisions which are influenced greatly by society it is society that causes the wage gap,0
some good ideas would be potato friesno oil pasta bean tacoslots of protein,0
boys will be boys and girls will be girls,0
i see this going viral ,0
i love this movie ,0
they should make a third gender in competitions transgenders vs transgenders solved or these men who are identifying as women should compete with what their biologically body is not who they identify as,1
yay this is so exciting maybe she can get shane to try going vegan,0
im sorry but i think these facts should be examined carefully st companies do not only want to reduce costs they are willing to hire better professionals paying them more nd women tend to chose low paying majors not just because of simple individual will culture sex roles family etc are mediating variables that influences these decisions same in men men are raised hearing they should beare good at math and fixing things also they are socially rewarded by compliments etc by being good at these fields no doubt they chose engineering and math as a major their toys as kids are astronaut dolls and mechanics women toys are babies and nurse barbie women are raised as the caring ones the mommy ones no doubt they chose social work and early education it is sexism people dont make decisions out of nowhere culture and society are playing a role there rd we need to examine why men are willing to be on call in a job men have the pressure to be the provider in the family thats why they are willing to be on call willing to have a better salary women dont have these pressure and the ones who have it are not the standard this video has some points but i think every idea exposed here needs to be discussed in a deeper way it shouldnt be this simple to talk about a subject this complex,0
they need to make a choice go trans or compete there is no in between,1
i dont understand milk and eggs dont hurt anything and theyre deaths are quick and painless thanks to temple grandin,0
and then you have to boneheads trying to push women into higher paying educations like engineering because they seem to think only those kinds of educations need to be  while none of them should necessarily be ,0
fried foods usually carry egg on them,0
they should give medals to rd th and th place its cruel for women sport to allow it those transgender girls are taking drug enhancements to allow them to race in a competing sport which should be drug free,1
vegan is a scam this propaganda a false religion man made false you need d and b and you never attack sugar and guess what climate change is not man made,0
if trisha transistions you should go back to male lmfao jkjk we like female blaire,0
thats gender fluid dumbass,0
vegecated is a great documentary on netflix,0
the leftist need their head examined,0
blair can you answer a question are  for me why is it that most trans women seem that they do not respect the space of natural born women and why dont they want there own space i think it is very disrespectful and insulting to all women that trans women think that have the right to say they are real women cause the fact remains they are not it seems they dont even have pride in being trans they want to be a natural women but will not and can not ever be no disrespect its just fact common sense thanks for your time,1
is clickbait really worth all this mental gymnastics,0
vox is that you,0
the first sentence just got me straight lol,0
lmao at everyone who actually believes that shes going vegan,0
race plays an important part as well,0
i identify as a sea biscuit seahe,0

thank the lord you understand that wage gap doenst exist,0
thank you for calling her outshe is making a mockery out of herselfthis is honestly so infuriatingusing such a topic to get views,0
is that the girl from studio c,0
why dont you eat vegetables they are healthy and good for you,0
this video titled there is no wage gap admitted a quarter through the video that a  cent wage gap exists,0
get beans rice kale and veggie sausageburgers,0
bruh im trans and im dying  shes so stupid,0
yes go vegan  try the brand gardein chicken strips they are sooo good,0
also dont let anyone make you feel bad or criticize your journey baby steps are still steps toward being vegan positive change is always amazing and please give it time and realize your small steps are helping toward the greater good ,0
oh my god good job trisha i am so proud your awesome,0
great job trisha you go girlwoohoothe vegans are here to help out if you need it,0
congrats girl i love being vegan and you will too,0
no thats not how it works these are all reliable facts but these have all been already considered its still true that women often earn less for the exact same work over the exact same time instead watching stupid videos on youtube that actually have a rightwinged agenda you should inform yourself properly,0
watch matt lush here on youtube he is a vegan also he knows alot  try veggie grill in la,0
this video doesnt address hiring  promotion policies or the fact that two people doing the same job may be paid differently usually the woman earning less some women are completely willing to work long hours and yet they still get paid less also according to the acfe women are less likely to commit fraud so maybe companies should consider hiring more women into higher level positions,0
i seriously dislike freelee as a vegan i prefer to watch the unnatural vegan instead and other youtubers who use science and evidence to back up reasons for going vegan beyond animal rights and how to make sure you dont have a bad transition track your nutrition and research places to eat to help give yourself a safety guard from accidentally meatanimal products ,0
say anything with gumption and theyll believe you,0
well done trisha if i was you id look up some accidentally vegan junk foods that you like now a lot of pringles flavours dark chocolate etc do some research and i really recommend getting pinterest theres so many great vegan recipes on there also hotforfood is an amazing youtube channel with tones of amazing recipeswell done on trying this lifestyle so wonderful cause youve such a huge influence ignore all the negative vegans and embrace us positive ones  also i wouldnt try to be super super healthy straight away maybe just do the vegan version of your current diet  and i wouldnt expect instant results this diet is slow and steady not a fad one youll get there in the end and stay there  love your videos always make me smile ,0
yay good for you trish  love youxoxo,0
i love you freelee  ,0
and yet you wonder why the rest of the world thinks americans are crazy does this transgender nonsense mean that these two humans still have a penis or a vagina,1
you know why transgender women dont run male track cus men are biologically faster you know why transgender men run womens track cus their flippin fast this is stupid if this happened at my meet im hoppin in that race and taken that persons first place,0
hahaha her going vegan lasted a hot second fake bitch cant stick with anything,1
trisha is a genius by starting a conversation and using satire in her video she is a smart troll,0
i like straight men so i must be trans because im a gay man poor trisha all the additives are going to her poor brain,1
me transgender ftm me sees this video notification me oh fuckin hell here we go,1
 factually correct lul wat,0
i personally think she really does have identity issues sorry i know issues doesnt sound right but i cant think of the right word i think we need to come at her more gently because its so clear that trisha has so many different problems and i do believe that shes actually working hard to change herself but theres so much going on and she just wants to belong maybe shes not trans but shes very much confused i dont think she was doing this just for money she is a very confused and damaged person that needs to really focus on herself and people need to cut her some slack,0
vegan consumerism and capitalism,0
i saw actually no proof what so ever most men and women dont work career jobs but by the hour jobs which do not have a wage gap,0
love this woman,0
i remembered this video after i had to watch a video about gender equality that brought up the wage gap i have no idea why i had to watch that video though for my class the class has nothing to do with gender equality its a child development class i do love how you can get real statistics from prager university though,0
im so happpy,0
i just turned vegan and my body is barley getting use to all the protein im putting in but i honestly feel like after a while youll like it  will want to be vegan longer but for now im happy for you but i feel like people have the wrong idea with what vegan means its not only the way you eat but the way you live life idk my fellow vegans out there know what im talking bout and like i said i have a little bit but i love how it makes me feel more and more and you should try it for more that  weeks cause you will just over all be in such a better place not only physically but mentally and emotionally,0
notice how the gap in pay jumped up in the ssomething big must of happened then whispers equal pay act of  also people need to note that jobs do not have equal amount of men or womenmeaning theres mostly men in the tech field theres mostly women in nursing theres mostly men on oil rigs or theres mostly women social workers with each field paying differently there should of been a comparison of same jobs from the same companies as different companies do pay different salaries for different jobs when the initial survey or study was done,0
yes it is fair that your child be excluded because they are biologically a male,1
i appreciate this take on the issue,0
i love all these films but i really like this one because there is absolutely nothing in this film that prevents it from possibly being shown in schools,0
thats because the man is usually at work once again thats not sexist thats just a fact men tend to work while women stay home,0
i want to become veganbut i dont even know where to start,0
this happened because of the leftists,0
looks like i have to deal with this untrue misleading garbage just to watch the interesting stuff you post,0
oh my fucking gosh bitch you cannot be ignorant to the fact that you cannot change everyones lives you meet if they want to be vegan let them do it only if they are genuine about it if you come on with a strong approach its like youre shoving bullshit into their head and its just going through one ear and out the other,1
i dont understand the argument thats shes starting todaythis was filmed forever ago why would she buy all of that fruit and let it go bad ,0
great video thanks for proving that there is no gender wage gap ive heard alot about this and i never actually knew if there was a wage gap between gender and i wanted to find out,0
i know them lol,0
that theres is none,0
they can barely beat women lmao they suck,1
love you freelee ,0
mmmmmmoney money money money money money money money money,0
thank you again love you guys ,0
wow is the echo chamber strong with this one massive anecdote and such little facts,0
freak show to weak to be a man to strong to be a woman,1
why does it look like it sucked on a boat hull and subsequently was attacked on the lips by a lobster,1
looking to a plantbased world,0
subscribed trans youtubers who have made a video kalvin garrah  storm ryan  london jammidoger blaire sam collins weve got the whole gang,0
good job vox the video is both factually correct and proposes the solutions to solve the gender gap that exists in the same profession on the same position this an intellectually honest and interesting video the problem is that it will not solve the infamous  cents to a dollar since women will still be more likely to take part time job or be home stay mother and against what feminists say it is valid and respected choice so this  should be dropped all together,0
she could be gender fluid but who really knows,0
watching this eating carrots and peanut butter yum,0
im transfinancial then im a rich girl caught in a poor girls body smh,0
well this was a way too long load of bullshit,0
i was waiting for you to make this response,0
awesome this is total cause of u,0
how tf is she a drag queen ,0
trisha i am so sad that youre stooping this is revolting youre grasping and exploiting and you cant,0
wow i unsubscribed months ago because i thought she was bad thenbut now damn just damn,0
trish you should do some research about the vegan lifestyle there are many videos on recipes and tips to help you out good luck ,0
girl youre gonna suck at this lmao you already fucked up,1
this isnt an issue woman in general just make different career choices than men working less or not at all in order to stay at home and raise the kids isnt a bad thing,0
is it very graphic could anyone tell please,0
what they miss is something that ceases to exist,0
she legit just finished eating chicken waffles  pizza from her last snap that didnt last long  im so disappointed,0
lets be clear there should not be a wage gap at all when men and women with the same education in the samesimilar jobs should not make k less than their male counterparts from the start women should not be making  less over a significant portion of their working life compared to men that comes out to millions of dollars women lose out on,0
what was the point of putting this up when its like month old video and you obviously did not stick to being vegan,0
it sounds like shes describing a gender fluid person  im so confused,0
sure the estrogen treatments will bring the testerone levels down but even with that theyre still going to have a lot more testerone in their bodies than the average female walking around a lot more and then of course you have the difference of bone structure so of course they have an advantage theyre men saying theyre transgender or taking estrogen doesnt change that their chromosomes are still xy and always will be god bless them and i hope one day they come to the truth,1
we need to show this to everyone and give this amazing woman an award for being so awesome,0
its against the law to pay different wages for the same job based on gender its an income gap because women take more time off for child rearing,0
theres is a gap simply because you are comparing two there is no such thing as exactly the same not sexism on a world wide scale there may be but not in modern westernized civilizations if there is sexism it would probably be a very small percentage,0
there was one thing that i think is important about the business type jobs too and that is that they are often more physically demanding jobs that women tend to shy away from,0
got a woman to say it so they cant be called sexist good idea,0
if she can vegan anybody can,0
i have been waiting for this vid need queen blaires touch on this,0
can you fix that title,0
dont you see they only want to live animalsarenotours,0
honestly freelee we her name is looks way too skinny but happy for you mama trish,0
unless the definition of trans now includes identifying as yt junk food then no trisha is not trans,0
dayhm she must really like banana in dat thumbnail,0
i cant take you seriously anymore seriously,0
she is confused about everything thats all,0
i feel like everyone is hating on him because they dont know how he feels i personally have always felt like this its  and we should except him for who he is leave him alone and let trish be who he is ,0
lets not forget that women take more sick days those menstrual cycles make life miserable for some women every month,0
i kinda wish people would just have a little faith in her like idk at least shes putting forth effort not everyone can go vegan overnight i get that baby steps guys trust that she will get there her mind set is changing there will be slip ups but if everyone through in the towel after every mistake how would anything ever change shes bound to make mistakes bound to slip up but that doesnt mean she should give up or stop,0
subscribed our point of views are exactly the same this video needed to be made,0
when i got the notification i thought she was just trolling,0
freelee the banana girl paid trisha to promote her  she didnt really go vegan  freelee the banana girl made a video about it  search for it ,0
i am sooo proud of you omg you inspire me more than fl lol,0
veganism is a lifestyle what you wanna do is called a plantbased diet,0
remember when she identified as a chicken nuggetlmfao,0
this doc makes it seem as if veganismplant based diets are close to overtaking the meatdairy industry there has been major movements but still a very long way to go be on the right side of history and just start now,0
freelee is shitting her pants right now no hate love to you both this is amazing trish and i hope you continue after the  wks i would do it at least a month to notice the full benefits although you will after  wks itll be more of a dramatic holy shit transformation both on the outside weight skin etc and how you feel best of luck its so much easier and beneficial then people make it out to be especially in la you have so many options delivery services vegan only venues and such youll do great ,0
trish im so happy youre trying this out eating carbs like potatoes rice pasta and other noodle dishes will help you get the calories you need to stay healthy you can also try making some dishes with beans in them just google vegan recipes and youre sure to find lots of great options good luck,0
morning star farm  gardein are amazing tasting fake meat products made of soy protein they taste exactly like real meat,0
yay u go girl,0
i love veganism and so does the earth and life living on it   ,0
v o c a l f r y,0
even as a feminist i can agree with this it makes sense another factor on this is that a lot more women stay home im not saying that all women do it but a much larger majority do causing statistics to be shaky,0
im sorry but no,0
wage gap doesnt exist,0
you need some serious help thats all i am going to say about that,0
awesome the vegan movement is growing rapidly,0
youtube vegan recipes,0
i love you trish this is a great start but remember if you were on a restrictive diet chances may be you might gain it back to your healthy weight just warning you but when you do eat unhealthily and you start a vegan diet you make feel like shit may have breakouts this is actually just your body cleansing and yes fruits are the best way to lose weight has lots of carbs more than vegetables so keep in mind also dont buy packets of stuff youll probably just lazy and broke no joke just so to any produce section and buy a whole watermelon cantaloupe ect you definitely get your moneys worth again love you and have hope,0
almost pure junk food vegan here but still looking good just eat in moderation  good luck ,0
this is complete bullshit  and you know it,1
doesnt like makeup guess im a guy i,0
here before everyone unsubscribes,0
so ive never actually watched one of her videos until now and im just so so confused who is her boyfriend theres so many videos with different people shes with is she really transgender really pregnant i saw a comment about being a different race she said she doesnt want to be center of attention what is happening lol ,0
finally you stupid btches are getting it the trans movement is harmful to women this is shameful stealing medals trophies and scholarships even hormone therapy does not change the body enough,1
lol thats not really true she twists the data to show what she wants but you cant really expect her to present on wage gap while shes agaisnt feminism while i was working in service early college years i was doing basically nothing but was paid more than my female counterpart the problem with wage gap is that women have lower hourly wage than men this can of course change if youre manager and negotiate about your potential income but if youll come somewhere for some basic noschool position and theyll offer you less only because youre a women thats the problem,0
lol most of these vegan nuts are pro abortionexplain that,0
the wage gap is bullshit it is only there because men generally work over timetake less holidays retire at a later age and take more risks than women and if there was such a thing dont you think that companies would be hiring women instead to save money,0
where is my wage gap button oh shoeonhead where are you,0
are you serious right now,0
go to mommytang channel she is vegan and she give u recipes good luck,0
christina hoff sommers laying down the truth as always dont know how many times it has to be said before registering in the minds of lowfunctioning feminists but alas it will continue to be said until then,0
i wanna slap my sister for believing in feminist propaganda,0
sprouts and whole foods has a lot of vegan food,0
good luck i am doing it too with u,0
this is incredibly stupid and offensive to anyone who does go through a transition period and have a hard time figuring out who they are you dont like attention but you make this hellacious video youre exploiting the struggles that real people have that cause them to endure violence discrimination being disowned and alienated all for views im repulsed,1
maybe the fact that it doesnt exist,0
you never know maybe being vegan will help you have kids  ive heard it happen before,0
its ok to eat fish cause it dont have any feelings,0
freelee is going to be responding to this with major thumbs up,0
you cant just identify as something you have to have a reason for that to be apart of your identity that is classed as dysphoria that is the reason for people to identify as trans,0
just to be clear there is no real prager university outside of this video production group prager university is really just republican propaganda,0
wow  awards in  years keep it up,0
either the world ends or we all become vegan i think myself and world are still here ,0
the propaganda in this video and almost all prageru vids is insane my wife has a masters in accounting and a cpa before she started working at a accounting firm she had worked as the accountant for  different business she was the accountant so she knew exactly what everyone was making since she had to do payroll at all  jobs women who held the same management positions as other male managers were paid anywhere from  to  less a year higher up the ladder it only got worse do not trust prageru they lie and never present any actual facts only ideals and opinions they think you should live by its a scam school,0
do they really need two videos to explain this,0
another bitxh that no community wants to claim so shes trying to be accepted in the lgbt  community smh ur ridiculous,0
i work at a truck company with a woman that gets paid more than me why because she has more experience i dont complain,0
omg at first i thought this was a joke but its real and that makes me so happy great for you trish i really hope you stick with it for the animals the environment and your body ,0
holding meryl streep down to watch this would be like throwing water on the wicked witch of the west,0
a lot of people compare earnings not wages so men tend to make more because statistically they work more hours then women,0
women do not make less than men they work less that simple,0
i dont like to think all feminists are bad not at all but still thank you for making this even as a female i didnt really believe this was happening not considering all the evidence against it this ad just reminded me my dream job as a psychologist doesnt pay well though aha,0
if the wages arent enough get a job where there is,0
honestly i am  not vegan i truly found you abrasive in previous videos this video changed my view on you you showed compassion and empathy you were complelty supportive and kind and i seen another side to you just subscribed looking forward to more videos ,0
its so amazing seeing these two get on and supporting one another yey vegan ism such huge progress ,0
the vocallll fryyyyy in this videoooo is brutalllllll,0
 it doesnt exist,0
hey freelee i have a question for you do people hurt cows for milk,0
shes not vegan anymore,0
remember she came out as a chicken nugget says a lot,0
usually i would be on the trans side but its been very much proven that men are faster and stronger on average than women and i feel like they should have a trans team or have to extend their use of hormones,1
you arent but ok,0
earnings doesnt equal wage earnings gap is explained as fake if hiring women was cheaper men wouldnt be employed,0
women want kids you arent going to change society oh boo hoo youre not earning as much money as men men are dieing doing the hard work like cleaning sewers and building bridges,0
the amount of internalized misogyny oh boy,0
congrats please watch mommytang she has super delicious asian vegan recipes that are really easy to make ,0
trish dont watch those videos just dont freelee link in description ,0
iam  year vegen  but i hear greta and i am out  dont eat shit also no vegen shit,1
people like this is why my family thinks lgbt is a joke ,0
fyi a different video said miller competed as a male during the winter track season then converted to female track after it was over somehow that didnt get into the news hmm,0
baby steps guys i literally ate a dozen donuts last night i love trish,0
couldnt have explained it better myself i hope more people keep watching this video thanks,0
shes not going vegan shes trying it for two weeks and i can guarantee she will cave before then it is never a last minute decision to make a lifestyle change and also never a healthy decision freelee is like that annoying jehovahs witness at your door or the person that leaves a business card for their church in your tip jar she thinks you can switch lifestyles at the drop of a dime and that is so unrealistic,1
i started being vegan in   waaay before it was so popular  im so happy ore and more ppl are going vegan  back when i started it was quite obscure,0
ugh we still on this crap xx,0
hey freelee i am a vegan and i will be a freshman in college next year with that being said i could really use some help with diet next year because i will not have easy access to cooking devices such as an oven or stove top if you could give some easy affordable vegan things to eat for your regular college student that would be soooooo helpful i didnt necessarily go vegan for health reasons i mainly did it for ethical so if you know of any vegan tv dinner companies or anything that would be helpful please make a video please thumbs this up so she sees this and is able to help broke college student maintain the beautiful lifestyle of veganism ,0
this is so informative im so proud to be able to offer people vegan certified products in health and beauty proving that you dont need animals or toxins to look and feel your best its the future,0
i watched a slaughterhouse video but meat is soy gud,0
she just ate chicken on her snapchat yesterday lol i guess being vegan for two weeks sucked,0
i love blair her cat has the same name as me angela,0
she did say shes trying vegan for  weeks she didnt say anything about doing it for life,0
the two girls seem to be of fairly low iq and incapable of empathy,1
considering shes says been through  months of therapy is kinda confusing that she didnt mention the word dysphoria once,0
how did it even come to this living in clown world here all the girls on the team must be so frustrated why participate when you know you have no chance of winning because boys are allowed to come in and compete in what is supposed to be a girls only sport,1
i think i hate scomo as much as abbott,0
my cat watched your video and tried to pounce on my phone to play with you it was so cute also trisha has been flaunting her nude body around before she made this video so if need more proof shes not trans though she really needs to sue whoever did her boob job,0
they miss the fact that it is not true because it does not account for hours worked,0
i been vegan since october   and i aint stopping ,0
if women can be men and men can be women and gender is a just social construct then there is no such thing as a wage gap,0
no one will ever have a better coming out than eugene lee yang,0
a gender wage gap isnt gender wage gap really,0
she looks like the only lasting interest she is capable of sustaining is her obsessive love for a puppet frog does she also refer to herself as moi,0
yayy vegan fam  ,0
no women just dont chose higher paying jobs,0
 its not real  the end,1
am i poor  do i have money none  what an idiot but some will watch anything put that blonde on some strong drugs,1
id recommend looking up the youtuber unnatural vegan she makes easy satisfying and realistic recipes and she also goes into the science of what you need for daily intake to make sure youre getting all the nutrients such as protein and b,0
at least gigi is consistent the far left says that if you identify as something that is what you are no questions asked if you are a  year old man and you identify as a  year old girl you must be treated and accepted as a  year old girl i also understand and agree with you blair you dont accept that premise that identifying as something makes you that thing so youre not going to go along with what trisha says unless shes willing to walk the walk its the people who say that youre a bigot if you dont accept the  year old man as a  year old girl but who are also criticizing trisha those are the people i have a problem with theyre being hypocritical,0
im both trans and gay but not offended shes a troll anyone with working eyes and ear can tell,0
k of k is  so its  less and not  less should be something like while women were earning  of what men does no  less leaves ,0
trishhhhh noooo why didnt you educate yourself on what it actually means to be transgender before you recorded this i sense youre trying to vocalize feelings n maybe lean toward gender fluid which is great and you should explore this and be open and pride about it hell yes but youre totally misunderstanding and misconstruing being trans and def saying some things that are pretty wildly offensive even if you didnt intend it to be yeeeeeesh educate yourself first bc you gotta at the very least understand the terms before you claim to identify i support you exploring your gender identity and sexuality but please please please invest some time in educating yourself first youre gonna ostracize yourself and others in the community with hastily labeling yourself without understanding xx,0
stir fry is my favorite vegan option super simple and really filling,0
starbucks has soy and almond as a alternative and daiya is a company that makes really good vegan food whole foods has a lot of good vegan foods,0
ever heard of non binary i feel like thats what youre describing yourself to be,0
trish is a troll however in the past years been through shit if shes having a mental breakdown i wish her the best,0
i would have spent another minute and explaine that having these choices is a good thing for women an alternative that requires government intrusion to remedy perceived discrepancies would force women to work longer house perform more dangerous jobs etc that they may not want in the end this seems a nonissue  time to move on unless youre fund raising nice video,0
its worth it for aesthetics im telling you im  and  stones ft and  years old its not unhealthy but thats only because i was underweight in the past and this diet has helped me out so much to be the healthiest ive ever been i dont have junk in my body and it feels great your body will love you ,0
herms  this is truly a perversion of reality  i feel like i am so it so and the dudes are selfish liars too  sick selfish parents are fools,1

trisha paytas im lgbt everyone else which part trisha paytas yes,0
i was waiting for this d,0
wow this is great my tip would be to eat as much as you want within a meal avoid snacking between meals and dont be too fanatical about exactly what it is youre eating ie how healthy it is  as if you can find things you enjoy and also make you satiated the longer youre going to stick with it and actually become less obsessive about what youre missing out on also dont worry about what others think or say about your choices just know within yourself  and be happy within yourself that you are doing this for the right purposes ,0
ive loved trisha for years im so super excited that your collab helped her go vegan youre amazing girl not only have you impacted her life but the lives of soooooooo many myself included keep up the amazing work you do,0
 minutes late but early lol,0
anyone else confused af,0
how the eff can you say there is no wage gap and then say the actual wage gap wtf  and how why cant we focus more on putting more women in stem fields,0

my english teacher tried to tell me i was sexist for explaining why it doesnt exist,0
so extremely rare that prager u makes an argument i agree with bravo,0
i need help to destroy feminism so in the same worked time and same type of job why theres still a little little tiny gendergap i said because of bonuses like distance between home and work danger in work etc maybe those bonuses there not exist in your contry but in spain they do my feminists friends says that is because woman cannot ascendrise up in work as easily as man do of course there are statistics that prove that im not wrong but i have not arguments to prove that woman can ascend btw someone correct me if i had mistakes on the previous text wanna learn english xd thank you so much,0
i cant believe this bitch got a mermaids ad but actually dysphoric and transition trans youtubers dont get ads,1
how does the world allow such obvious cheating,1
i was hired to a position previously occupied by a male about my same age when i was cleaning out the filing cabinets i came across a pay stub he had left was i surprised and angry to see his salary was k more than i was offered and i was more qualified to boot i had no children so that wasnt an issue and was known for working long hours often long after everyone else in the office had gone home it was blatant taking advantage i left after  months when i realized there would be no moving past the glass ceiling or changing the male dominated management mentality men need to realize that women can do work as well or better than a man and get over their baseless fears of possibly inadequacy,0
prager u is gay,0
my body healed up faster and i was in a hospital that offered bean bugers,0
blaire always coming through with reality period simple fucking reality trisha kills me and i think shes just trolling shes sick and blaire is the queen of all of all  since youre reading comments youre gorgeous,0

vegan for  years and i am  my husband went vegan at the same time he is  he works as a joiner on building sites with lads half his age he has more energy strength and stamina now than ever before and keeps up with the young ones easily they are so impressed with him that they are all asking about his diet and trying vegan food we eat a very high whole foods diet with very little junk food though and we are loving it we both feel so much healthier and happier and are loving food more than ever before,0
no i am so sexist i am willing to spend  more on wage just to hire mens despite there are equally qualified and capable woman out there lol,0
blame feminists and sjws and obama they did this to you and geuss what this is the equality ladies were looking for so when it doesnt go your way its unfair i geuss that equality talk is demolished,1
korwin was right,0
im always blown away by this narrative liberals think that capitalism is so greedy if so wouldnt capitalist businesses hire the cheapest wage liberalism sjw feminism and so forth a complete lack of knowledge facts and most importantly logic oh thats right according to feminist logic is now deemed as sexist,0
what i would like to know is how many single women live on starvation pay after pension compared to single men because these women continue to pay men about  cdn per hour for construction for example and vehicle maintenance people about  an hour while most of these wealthy male pensioners can do their own work i suspect most women on pension earn about half of what men receive and therefore have serious troubles paying for food clothing medicine medical care etc in old age compared to what men have it seems no government will ever dare tally the differences in each province or state with regard to single female pensioners versus male because they dont want to admit that old men are living like kings compared to old women who in many cases are starving,0
hey trish im so glad to see you are going vegan i originally did it for a few weeks at first and took me about a year to transition ive been vegan for two years and i love it ive lost fifteen pounds and still have my curves my advice to you would be stick to whole foods follow mr and mrs vegans wslf guide maybe even reach out to them for a potential collab check them out on instagram youtube and tumblr good luck on your vegan challenge,0
im a progressive but the left blows this out of proportion that being said there is almost certainly a small wage gap attributed to discrimination also prageru can eat shit conservative propaganda,0
wow its amazing to see the year summarised so much happened go vegan ,0
i asked my teacher why she thinks there are infinite genders and she said because of the gender wage gap,0
i had a feeling blaire was going to come trish oof ,0
three minutes in and ive already caught myself making that one face you make where you dont know whether or not to be confused or amused with the lack of knowledge,0
she came out as black bish anyone who has eyes knows that,0
i decided to try pescatarian because of a hot youtube girl talking about it and i mainly eat rice with fish for lunch it wasnt too hard to cut red meat after doing more research i realize maybe i should go vegan i need to get better at cooking and preparing meals and recipes to make the transition easier im trying to clean out my fridge of old stuff and then replacing it with whole plant based food its healthier cheaper and better for animals environment humans etc never in a million years would i have considered going vegan beforehand thanks malin malle,0
what people miss about the gender wage gap what people miss is that it simply does not exist vox needs to stop spread leftist lies,0
trisha makes these videos because they get her attention and she knows she will get away with it any other person wouldve been cancelled but since its trisha and shes been problematic from the beginning of her yt career it is expected from her and people give her a pass anyway after acting offended for maybe a week and a half,0
the wage gap only happens because men work more dangerous jobs get jobs that are more successful such as engineering while woman are more likely to work in fashion also men work more overtime than women,1
great video the gender wage gap is real sexism is real racism is real but doing nothing but complaining wont make a difference women and men pick different jobs with a lot but not all women choosing to have kids or lower paying jobs in a variety of different fields for example a vetobgynpediatricianpsychologistpsychiatrist will obviously make less then heart and brain surgeons why do women gravitate towards lower paying jobs its their choice why do women have kids its their choice so,0
can we all agree this is the best youtube ad we were all forced to watch,0
if i had a dollar for everytime i need to show this video to somebody,0
freelee better be recording right now,0
i dont think shes trans she dressed up as troy from hsm a few weeks ago and i think she thought oh maybe im trans because i dressed up as a guy and had fun like i dressed up as a guy before too and had fun still am cis trish,0
hey freelee you look a little different and as you said physical goals are okay if you got work done just let everyone know its not a big deal if there is something about yourself that makes you unhappy then change it you seem sweet and your heart seems full you have so much beautiful potential,0
the wage gap between male and female is complete nonsense im taking human resources management in college right now and the professor just recently told us that females make only c to the  that men make what crap but then again i am a conservative in southern california,0
blender check grocery store with imported undigestable plants check slow malnutrition cannibalism check veganismmalnutrition check mate,0
wow over k thumbs up who is buying that if you check comments you conclude those thumbs up arent real,0
so the jist of the video is women get paid less because children give men some power like ability to decide if a child can live or be aborted equal property rights in divorces some say around the house some say in how the children are raised then the universe might be kinder to you until then thats your issue to deal with stop blaming men,0
look guys  you use the word feminist as if every liberal female is one the libtards make up a very small minority of the left wing political persuasion its such a double standard to call the other side retarded when youre own is so far from perfect itself,0
why do i want to cry lol,0
potato and pasta are your best friend for life gurl,0
shame on lindsey davis asking ridiculous questions to those two boys this is exactly how braindead people are in the movie idiocracy,1
can we have one for britsh men and woman,0
im mean your choice i dont get why there is hate i mean sure you mabey didnt have to make a video but thats fine if you identifies as a gay guy you did put a disclaimer at the start so even if it sounded effective you didnt mean to be right the viewers really shouldnt be hating on you its your choice love you anyway,0
should my defense for beating up my neighbors kid b that i identify as a kid or what if i get caught doing the neighbors dog should i b let off the hook cuz i identify as a dog what if im caught molesting the neighbors  year old is it ok since i identify as an  year old how far r we going to go wthis stupidity,1
when i saw the title what people miss about the gender wage gap i thought it would talk about how blatantly the wage gap is calculated by just dividing the average earning of a male by the average earning of the counterpart female but nooo this video along with certain feminists yes not all feminists are alike just like how all muslims arent terrorists politicians and celebrities completely ignore the fact that some women choose different careers and work hours hey by the way the number of employed men that are alive should also different from the number of existing employed women well thats just a hunch and im  so judge what you will furthermore just for a second lets assume that the wage gap is in fact real and women get paid c for every dollar a male makes that said why for what reason dont all companies hire only women since it is c cheaper than hiring a male dont companies want the most bang for their buck and not spend more money than they have to this would save tens of thousands maybe millions of dollars every year if their workforce only was comprised of women well who knows anyways i am not trying to diss women here please that is not the message i am trying to get across if that is how you feel i apologize moreover i do concede that women do work less than men in most cases due to their schedule and that is what this video talks about and that is what we should be worrying about and for that reason i did not dislike the video but nor did i give it a thumbs up so fighting to get rid of the stereotypical notion that women should be at home solely responsible for the kids is the real war we should be fighting and we are we are progressing but we are obviously not there yet and everyone should be contributing this also isnt just about women but everything that concerns another humans well being paraphrased from mlk so there isnt anything wrong about a feminist or any advocate for that matter as long as you are well educated so what im trying to say is earning does not equal wage cookiopuss ps youtuber neither is the earth flat and thanks for reading all of this if you did,0
i think she just means she feels nonbinary and felt liberated from social expectations of a woman when she dressed like a man i dont think that necessarily constitutes trans man though,0
the gender wage gap can never be used as an point of argument anymore because it is just saying that there are only  genders malefemale when really that is just assuming everyones gender which really triggers me,0
fuck freelee dont listen trish dont fucking do that,1
more flexible hours im in,0
if you believe in this wage gap come work at my companyim here getting paid per job and used to stay till pm you can be a unicorn for all i careyou get paid by completing and turning in the job,0
if i get hored at mcdonalds and a woman gets hired at mcdonalds for the same position we will both get payed minimum wage i dont see a wage gap there,0
that does not affect your skin dairy lol,0
if you get a female to male trans who hasnt fully transitioned on the bottom you still get a woman bro im a cis woman but still that shits super super super offensive i feel bad for all the actual transgenders who may be triggered or upset over this video this video is super insensitive wow i need comment on videos but i just had to for this one,0
crackle crackle crackle damn that voice,0
i just balled my eyes out watching that short clip about animal harm i think its time to start reevaluating on what i eat,0
one of the things i hate most about all of this is that its trendy to as you say come out its trendy to be progressive its trendy to be part of an oppressed or marginalized community,0
once you stop being vegan the vegans are going to react like how some idiots reacted to your im voting trump video they will spam your videos thumbs down every one making this public is a mistake live it for atleast a few months before you proclaim youre going vegan poor shicurves has been treated like shit by vegans due to this mistake of claiming vegan and going back to animal produce,0
i dont like theythem pronouns thats confusing bitch you cant be trans and transphobic,1
this is still where you are incorrect about any kind of earnings gap pertaining to gender the gap doesnt exist at all to say that it is still only  makes anyone with this claim incorrect this is why politics suck a specific political stance will try to generalize everyone and think they are compatible within the generalization we are not like apples and oranges the comparisons are more like beets and bananas there has been a controlled scientific study that took a singular case under extreme measures to further disprove such a myth the males and females were of same age applying for the same position ethnicity and even the experience behind it the employer was told that the first  being hired could not have an increased starting pay if negotiated for it and needed  females as well as  males  from each gender had to fit low class criteria the same rule also applied for black skinned and white skinned and so it had less discriminative power the other  of each gender were going to be split the same way but of middle class this was a closed off  year experiment do you know what happened within this study the men did  more work than the average employee all  asked for more hours after  weeks this does not including job training and  asked for a raise after the first year while the counterpart female was  less productive than the average employee  females one lower class black and one middle class white took  days off after  years only one of the females asked for a raise after  in a half years additionally  of the males were looking for another part time job while working with the one they had no wonder the gap is seen as a large problem between genders males just seem to work harder and they are reprimanded for it,0
shanaynay kickin some ass you go girl,0
trishno please your being really offensive,0
ive never felt beating someone up is the answer to anything but that belief is being reevaluated after witnessing a transgender wipe the floor and manhandle a female wrestler i know liberals did this just to divide us another way and i want all you libs to know it worked i will despise the ground you walk on till the end of days and you best pray civil war never breaks out,1
allege wheres the allegation ,0
the manillivanilli of the female track world  what a joke these dudes should be playing on the football team of course its an east coast libtard state why is it not surprising dominating the competition i must be in the fing twilight zone well at least the real females can get participation plaques,1

yes its fair he is excluded be transgender but dont unfairly beat a bunch of girls they should feel ashamed running against and knowing they are depriving a bunch of girls from having their chance to win girls on the opposing school team line up and when they say go start walking dont walk off the field just let the boys have it why kill yourself,1
im vegan too ,0
so with  genders which one does this trisha fall under would it be the insane attentionwhore gender,1
you make it sound like all women resent being mothers and its a chore to be a mom,0
mom and dad work in the same job mom worked for  hours and got paid  dad worked for  hours and got  problem solved,0
you know  i think its not  there is a gender wage gap or there is no gender wage gap  its something in between only looking at the average income is of course pretty dumb it does not account for so much  for instance more women staying at home however just brushing the whole thing off is not fair there have been actual studies that compare women and men with equal jobs qualifications and work time it showed that women actually earm  ct per dollar a man earns im no die hard sjw communist or whatever but brushing somethinf off from both sides as not existent or overexagerate is not too smart if youre interested in this go watch david pakmans video on gender pay gap,0
orwell warned us the heresy of heresies was common sense,0
just look up vegan alternatives to foods u like lol,0
you know its true when a woman is telling this a woman is telling this,0
 feminists were triggered by this,0
veganiism makes sense to me but to be honest a lot vegans look like theyve come out of a concentration camp why is that,1
love u but this aint it,0
yall can post whatever stuff you want that i dont agree with and i wont care but why does prager put these ads on shitpost videos i thought you could set the category of videos your ad appears on if so why not put them on political videos i just wanna watch a guy wake up his rabbit with an airhorn without having to deal with politics and the outside world for a bit,0

i bet shane is regretting having your name in his palette,0
 when you go to your favourite fast food restaurant youre going to be eating a fake hamburger pretty sure noone goes to a fast food restaurant expecting a healthy whole food extravaganza,0
women take on a disproportionate share of child rearing duties because they want to most of the time i took maternity leave with both my kids my husband didnt i have different hours so i can pick up my kids and do after school activities with them i want to be involved and i know the trade off is my career thats fine its just a choice of prioritization you cant have it both ways climb the corporate ladder get higher education put in the additional time and work to get promoted all while taking time off for personal life,0
i have been vegan for  years go vegan,0
shes literally insane,1
completely out of touch with reality can we do the same in boxing mma weighing lighting completions thats is ridiculous there is no line at all anymore,1
so much for womans rights,0

its againest the law to pay someone more if they do the same thing,0
i am forecasting a lot of female fatalities in boxing and martial arts,0
transgender needs their own sports league,1
i had to write a essay on why feminism is true and how women make less i almost just left my class,0
this is true on the whole however circumstances are everywhere i must contest to that point,0
so proud of you trish please check out stella the light on youtube shes awesome shes a personal plant based health coach with a couple start up programs she helped me understand the proper way to eat plant based ,0
im actually ok with thisdont  me,0
they maybe women now but they arent females since they lack the basics that nature gives the female body,0
fun fact women entering the workplace lowered wages for everybody,0
i cant look at her wtf is wrong with her face,0
i am for people exercising their rights but if these actions continue to transcend there will be future wars in regards to allowing trans people play in the nba nfl and all other national leagues which is unfair there should be a category in sports and other social areas that is made strictly for them in order to diffuse the gender wars and confusion,1
we are omnivores you idiots where do you get b from in plants,0
yay im glad you decided to become vegan or at least give it a try ive been a vegan since may the hardest thing to give up for me was cheese and eggs since i am a huge breakfast person the vegan eggs are really gross however aside from that ive found tasty vegan versions of everything else there are drastic differences in taste between brands as well it can sometimes be a hurdle trying to find the artisian  good brands as im from the same metropolitan area you are originally from rockbottom god i hate this city so much ugh lol anyway off topic it shouldnt be hard to find the good brands in ca i saw that youtuber vegan gains made a video response for you i think you should check it out he offers a lot of insight that i think would be helpful for you the best butter alternative brand i have found is called miyoko the best cheese brand would probally be chao melted or kite hill boca burger spicy chikin pattys are pretty good  hope this helps a little trish take care  ,0
there is no wage gap pay is commensurate to the experience and ability of one to perform the tasks in a job this means if you put the exact same hours in the exact same amount of effort and professionalism into a job your paycheck will show it it has nothing to do with gender skin color sexual orientation or any other trivialities women have different priorities so their paychecks show it,0
slaughter house videos are the reason ive been vegetarian for  years,0
why do we need to close the earnings gap ,0
thank god for a women doing this,0
small problem with the animation at  it shows the wage ratio shrink from  centsdollar to  centsdollar which means that the wage gap is even more extreme that we previously thought,0
theyre a pair of pathetic losers against other menso claim theyre women just to be able to win  tossers,1
why cant u just be a girl that likes gay guys and big butts on girls i dont see a problem there,0
this was so good the best one you guys have done yet,0
i know its not healthy but u can get vegan cinnamon rolls,0
i just think about all my trans friends and what they have gone through physically and emotionally to be their most authentic self to see her do this nonsense im like girlstop trans women of color are literally being murdered daily for existing why she felt the need to do this for clout i will never understand,0
this is so stupidi dont care if you dont want to be the gender you are born but dont compete in your pretend genders competitions its just not fair,1
i love spaghetti with portobello stemmed broccoli with quinoa and boiled red potatoesseasoned soy milk tofu scramble portobello steaks stir fry lol i could go on,0
this video makes a great job at explaing evrything that feminists are to stupid to understand in a very clear way,0
this is so great really hope you keep it up good luck d,0
so you have to somehow make companies and corporations to change their work ethic for women to shrink the pay gap the median shows that there are less woman making high wages compared to men and vox even admits that having kids greatly effects it having kids is a choice isnt itneeding flexible hours to accommodate taking care of your kid was a thing that happened to choice why must we actively try to change the wage gap if it doesnt even determine how successful a woman can be a solution could be to have more woman that dont have kids and dedicate lots of their time to work the wage gap is essentially not even oppressive but rather showing of how family systems tend to work it all comes down to whether or not you will settle down for a family or continuously put your knife to the grindstone,0
yes omg beans and rice and lentils are so versatile in cooking so many dips and falafels are surprisingly vegan going vegan also encourages a lot of home cooking like curries and other rice dishes dips and cool potatoes so try to make time for that too just remember that a lot of junk food may be vegan but that doesnt mean its healthy also for chocolate most dark chocolate should use soy instead of cow milk also drink loads of water just for the general toning of your body and keep dancing good luck trisha congratulations ,0
i dont see any female worker in dangerous industry or any work that require intense training,0
if they werent winning people wouldnt be so mad about it,0
how can there be a wage gap if gender is a social construct,0
modern feminism is regressive af,0
do a video on trishs eating animal products since she claims she is going to try and be vegan,0
vegan since june  best decision ever but honestly i still dont like to see er in this there has been groups that have been protesting for longer and dont have leading figures that downplay the holocaust i dont like how all the attention is grabbed by er and they have been harming the movement quite significantly in germany just my thoughts that needed to go somewhere so i chose a youtube comment,0
  and   do that math feminism,0
women like making and raising babies why is this hard to understand,0
im cis and even i know what ur describing is wanting to be masculine not feeling the need to be a man,0
do you make youtube videos,0
oh my goodnessi was watching s and s and just now thought im gonna have to watch the  edition and boom its just been a day since the upload its like i manifested it,0
there is no freaking wage gap u are so dumb oml,0
lol how does her attraction to gay men her being a normal woman who doesnt always doll herself up and her use of an outdated psychology theory that has no scientific proof have to do with being trans she is def trying to get more views not fair for people who are actually trans im cis and barely dress up have definitely been attracted to gay men but respected their sexuality and envy mens power sometimes but like no i could never honestly say im trans it isnt like that trisha honey btw i love your pronouns genius woman,0
she made a video of her eating stuff so she is not vegan you should check it out,0
hey im a sexy vegan bodypillow,0
thank you so much for this she really confused me and made me question my own sexuality lol and sorry if this offends any other trans but youre the most good looking trans i think ive ever seen hearteyes,0
for even smoothies or acai bowls,0
im excited for her d,0
are we in the twilight zone ,0
i love you so much blaire you are the best transwoman in the world,0
so basically its more of the various inconveniences that come with strict work hours than it is about sexism like the media makes it out to be this is extremely interesting,0
if you feel you were born in the wrong body that means you acknowledge your body as male they should not race women,1
wait  trisha is transgender,0
please explain how when the womens soccer team wins the world cup make less money when men lose it,0
to all of the people who call prager u propaganda stop you dont know what propaganda even is seriously though propaganda is misleading material created to decieve people prager u openly acknowledges that they have a very conservative bias so it would be grossly inappropriate to call them propaganda,0
freelee must be crying tears of joy,0
you can pretty much eat anything you want just veganize it instead of normal milk use any kind of plant based milk like almond or soy lots of great vegan cheezes and if you crave meat try out different kinds of fake meats just try out lots of different brands etc not all are great but many are its just a matter of trial and error,0
voxs uniformed leftist viewers only hearing these things for the first time,0
hi freelee i just wanted to say thank u so much for inspring me to become vegan ive been vegan for about  months now and all i can say is how amazing i feel and how good i feel about helping the animals and thank u for being such a role model for ily,0
blaire ur a bitch we all know this from how you treated warski and other people in the past continue to not make videos please and if you make some i will continue to not watch them as i normally do,1
i wish i earned   out of college,0
its true that theres no wage gap based on gender but why are jobs traditionally placed on women such as teaching valued less than jobs traditionally placed on men such as business shouldnt jobs such as education be valued more due to how important it is for a functioning society,0
eat lentils and beans because they have high protein and apples,0
please dont try and dictate the lgbt community when you clearly just seem confused and make a mockery of trans people,0
totally unfair to the girls and unfair to these boys with mental disabilities people should not be feeding into this shit,1
blasphemy how dare you use science and data to smear women you are a sexist and you should be fired stop advancing gender stereo type you bigot,0
my first vegananniversary is on this coming st january im so excited for shouting out loud my best year experience ,0
wait are you really defending the existenceof a wage gap now that everybody sane is trying to debunk it i worried that soon well see a video of why women should receive a salary for having kids,0
nobody trisha pronouns theythem multiple personalities,0
my mom simply stays home and actually takes her of her kids kids need a lot of attention but also restrictions to develop properly women are just designed to care for their kids breasts i dont want to say that women shouldnt be able to work but if they decide for a kid they should be able to invest time into their kids and not be forced to put them in a crche many people have problem with the teenagers today and i think a partial reason for that is parents spending less time parenting im  diligent and smart and i think part of that is because my mom set me rules because thats what a kid needs before it is able to realize itself that watching tv all day is a bad idea hrmusahrm,1
they wouldnt be angry if it was a transgender man racing against men and loosing theyre just upset because theyre good,0
you missed the part where men work harder,0
ive known for years the gender pay gap was made up and was disappointed when obama talked it up but u say in the video the aauw took into account choice found a wage gap and then still go on to say its about choice i believe the main point but treat us like adults and get into the  cent wage gaps nuts and bolts also this woman is a race traitor,1
can we not let this overshadow the real problem we need to be exterminated jonathan yaniv is being problematic once again ,1
you should watch vegan youtubes like fablunch,0
i wanna buy what shes smoking jkjkjk,0
how does a man know he feels like and therefore wants to be a woman how does he know what a female feeling feels like asking a man to describe female feelings is like asking a blind person to describe color whats the perceived difference between male and female feelings anyway if we can agree that theres no definition on feelings and their connection to your biological sex is it about the physical manifestation of gender do trans men just want their own boobs and vagina to play with and to go into womens toilets are they homosexuals that cant face reality and believe finding men attractive must make them women im interested to learn,0
i dont get the hate from the usual subjects according to their standards trisha is trans and we must accept that despite her not making any effort to transition if she claims that she is trans or any other gender identity that is obviously the only thing that matters and we have to play along with that so as to not trigger an instance of dysphoria otherwise we are obviously being transphobic at least gigi is being principled by playing along because the rest of the left sure isnt lmao,0
yes fully support you trisha welcome to the vegan life ,0
my main issue with this is the fact that feminist is used with a condescending tone there is nothing wrong with being an activist for equal rights feminist doesnt necessarily mean the outspoken people that everyone refers to as snowflakes,0
is she really tho,0
great video my only recommendation is that for a data heavy presentation like this you make you citations more accessible a lot of them would be really interesting to follow up also when you present try to sit up because when you lean over you have less control of the air coming out of your body and it leads to excessive vocal growls at the end of every sentencewhich is a common nervous issue great use of diagrams and i appreciated the slight pauses inbetween dense bits of data also a great job of breaking down statistics i have a much better understanding of what issues are related to wage gaps now after seeing this video,0
 feminist dont like facts bcz it doesnt support their views,0
being transgender is more of a trend nowadays its kinda sad,0
falafel egg plant,0
im a greedy person so i will hire women because apparently i could pay them lower that their male counterparts makes sense huh,0
the parents are mad bc the sisters are kicking ass bianca is prime example of a loser ass mad ass parent  let the girls do what makes them feel comfortable,1
came here just to dislike ,0
love how raw n real you keep it,0
just putting it out there maybe women just arent as smart,1
hi you have to watch out about eating too much fruit it has natural sugar,0
could you point me to where you found the aauw brought the gape down to  im searching but i cannot find it,0
usain bolt needs to identify as a female so he can dominate the womens  m dash at the olympics well into his s,0
thank you at our high school there is a club just for women where they say that women are oppressed they get less of everything and just about everyone there has some kind of demented social justice propaganda,0
im so proud of you my favorite protein is black beans and rice add lime and garlic salt for amazing flavor,0
the fact that a petroleum engineer earns the most money while social worker earns the least reflects something deeply wrong about the values of our culture social workers phycologists counselors etc help people navigate lifes complexities one on one where it is most needed petroleum engineers make gas companies wealthier and sustain co driven climate change thingspeople perhaps the problem is with our cultures values not our cultures sexism,0
if women that are not care givers and single without kids are making less than a man then we have a problem i dont see why its such a big deal that a women or a man can choose to be the one that stays and takes care of kids during early child development kids are important and there should not be shame to those that choose to take care of the children women or men,0
whenever you have that fatty unhealthy craving opt for nuts or peanut butter theres also this super great thing called pb and its a kind of peanut butter powder you mix up with some water and it has so much less fat than regular peanut butter and still tastes amazing,0
was with you till you came for nonbinary people nothing is more ironic than trans people trying to invalidate other trans people just a tip not everyones experience is going to be like yours the sooner you realize that the closer our community is going to be but go off sis you obviously think you the trans gatekeeper ,1
theres no problem with feeling masculine or connecting with men more than women im sure you dont mean to but youre making a joke out of the community take time to figure yourself out before you make a huge video that you know will upset people you dont have to have a label just be you literally figure yourself out please just stop its upsetting,0
congratulations you work fewer hours than others expect less overall pay you work more hours than others expect more pay that wasnt hard to figure out,0
so happy for trish,0
noooo why are you siding with the bitch freelee,1
why do people actually think there is a wage gap,0
nope you need to leave la your head is just fed up,1
the only person in the gatekeeper squad we need to make a response video now is ella love you blaire,0
nice math but average is not median,0
poorly done analysis proves just about nothing,0
those are men period,1
im so proud of you,0
the problem isnt animal agriculture its overpopulation our earth doesnt have enough resources to sustain  billion people and counting cutting out animal products from your life and replacing them with mass amounts of plant foods wont prevent the planet from destruction it actually causes more harm than good do proper research i was vegan for almost  years and happily went back to eating animal products veganism is an agenda filled with lies and bullshit glamorizing processed fake trash over the food that kept our ancestors alive you exist because your predecessors ate animals and yall are saying you escaped the matrix ha its just the beginning my friend,1
she made this video before her latest video was released shes back to her regular diet now,0
eat lots of nuts protein ,0
doesnt anyone realise that the fact that more women would refuse to date a man who earns less than her pushes him to earn more men tend to have different preferences towards women,0
so once in awhile you like to dress up youre attracted to men you cant have and like sensitive men and you wish u had a dick  because you associate power with having a penis your thinking isnt that complicated youre not transgender you just havent had a nice conversation with yourself to think threw your thoughts and feelings talk with your therapist about what you just talked about i have a feeling he might be able to help u out now if he doesnt then u might need a new one,0
just to help you out you are not transgender you are gender fluid there is a difference,0
the strongest animals on the planet are vegan humans can join that group of super beings through the generations,0
best video about wage gap on yt,0
you need to try gardien meats they have so many products that immitate chicken fingers and beef and its all so yummy i know that they are luxry vegan products and u dont rlly need them but it has rlly helped me transition into this lifestyle,0
the wage gap exists for more than just  reasons jordan peterson speaks about how there are about  factors that contribute to the wage gap potentially some contribute more than others or perhaps not one of the factors is discrimination against women that women activists hate so much despite the factor being a mere  of the issue,0
ive never seen freelee this happy everr,0
does it mean if im firmly on the bottom side i can use im trans nonbinary card now too,1
if you want to be a healthy vegan the best thing to do is cook things from fresh that way you know all the ingredients that are in it so know exactly what you ingesting but omg im so proud trish this is amazing good luck,0
shit i must be a man now because i dont cover up my zits,0
this is not to say that there arent sexist bosses of course but that they dont represent reasons for the tiny wagegap that does exist,0
look into demiboy demigirl nonbinary and gender non conforming im not saying youre trans or youre not as a transmasculine demiboy i think that i have no room to judge anyone ive been judged way too much myself for that but i think you really really need to educate yourself and not harm a community that has been harmed way to much sorry its hard to know when youre trolling and when you arent anymore and thats your own fault please educate yourself not just for your sake for once,0
its okay to be confused i confused body dysmorphia for gender dysphoria and i was under the transgender label for two years i was lost and didnt have answers to my questions i am now happy and going by sheher born gender its okay to be confused and try to find yourself whats not okay is saying you are trans when you are  comfortable with being the born gender you are its okay if you want to be t and you want to be more masculine however i dont think this is the right label now when you are finding yourself its okay to go through things and see what fits and what doesnt but i would suggest making that a personal journey off camera and coming back when you find yourself the trans community and the lgbt community in general get a lot of hate because people throw labels they know nothing about on themselves as a trend trans people are no longer valid in societies eyes because of transtrenders  not saying what you are going through is a trend but its something that takes more time and shouldnt be determined by the fact that you like gay men and you feel like you would be more respected if you had a penis its true you may not be just a cis women and i hope that you are able to find and love yourself because thats all anyone deserves i dont think you should be hated but i dont think you should jump into this label either because it will only cause backlash for you and the trans community with that said i hope you do well and find who you really are  in the end you are the one who knows yourself best,0
are you kidding me id love to make over  keeping this wage gap to only people in college is dumb a lot of people dont have college graduates and would love to make k a year when talking about the wage gap why dont we talk about the wealth gap i cant care about a genderbased wage gap when so many people are in poverty sorry just my two cents,0
lol fake news when are the vegans going to stop using animal products to live,0
wait the graph at  is badly interpreted could be interpreted as more it contributes for the pay gap but it doesnt mean that an individual woman make less just about how many women to men work in that job it is important as these  fields are the best paid fields so the less women in this field in average women make less,0
im sorry ive just looked at the third upside down graph and im done maybe if someone wants to redo this with intuitive charts i might be in,0
theres a fucking chik fil a ad above this,0
cyster transition from female to female,0
i dont like vegans,0
it almost sounds like the wage gap is the product of men and women making their own decisions and there is a statistical difference in the decisions women make vs men i see nothing wrong with this,0
this is ridiculous its so unfair on girls that dont have that extra testosterone that these males have,1
i am a woman and since childhood i knew that when i have kids i will work less hours and make less money whenever i say this online and explain that this means i need to marry a man who makes a good living i get called a gold digger,0
 gender fluid,0
you people made this idiot famous this all reflects on her dumbass fans lmao,1
trisha can pass for a transgender man she already looks like one after all its not like shes just pandering to the transgender community for more views or anything ,0
i am so happy for you dont apologize you are doing fine its always a little hard at first but youll get the hang of it and plus you have the whole vegan community to help you out eat potatoes rice beans cooked veggies pasta you can eat all the pasta you want lots of fruit and eat more watermelon and cantaloupe cause theyre low in calories and wouldnt fill you up and you might end up starving yourself which you dont want to do track your calories for the first week so you dont under eat good luck trish ,0
i had to pause the video and say your body is so bomb i saw your waist and justjaw dropped im envious,0
shes slipping yall,0
hi blaire i wanted to comment about the trisha situation i can admit honestly that up until now i did not always agree with your message mainly i didnt understand where it was coming from truly i am in a similar spot as some other younger trans people and i have to say things like this do not help its improper representation of trans people and its awful how trisha felt the need to capitalize as you mentioned but when this is one of the more trending videos this is what people associate us with and it is hurtful because it does indeed feel like trisha is mocking our very real struggles also i have learned so much about how to discuss these things across your videos overall that helped me shape my own understanding i just wish at the end of the day we honestly could help eliminate these problems im just surprised that gigi being a trans woman herself would support trisha i know her heart is in a extremely good place but it makes me wonder if gigi actually thinks that,0
so what im getting from this she has more guy friends and likes them more than her female friends so shes a guy thats the case with many girls she doesnt like attention all the time but she likes to dress up sometimes thats the case with a lot of humans in general she identifies as a man because she likes gay guys and therefore if she identifies as a guy shell somehow attract them girls can be attracted to less masculine men and be cis she wants to be more assertive and recognizes male privilege and recognizes she wouldnt be called a bitch for being ambitious as a guy ok obviously,0
trish honey how are you gonna back out of this one,0
her gender be like ight ima head out,0
trisha i love you x more while eating vegan you want to subsribe to freelee jk you want to eat high proportions of everything eat lots of healthy carbs like rice pasta and other grains have lots of fiber like chickpeasbeans etc if youre going to stay vegan which i would love then you want to take a vegan multivitamin and be sure youre getting zinc b and iron also hope this helped alittle love youu,0
why you swearin,0
businesses dont hire only women because they legally cant and i know for a fact that some businesses pay women less at least in alabama,0
go compete with the boys as a transgender you have a penis not a vagina you are genetically a boy you can identify as anything you want but you still have a penis male hormones male muscles i say private christian school,1
im not a subscriber but i would suggest you go vegetarian first and then slowly go vegan because honestly you wouldnt go vegan very easily especially from your past,0
pitts bread and hummus are great snacks,0
every feminist sitting back scratching their head,0
i aint vegan but its cool that shes trying it out at least,0
you forgot all the other  genders,0
trader jos has really great vegan options in their frozen foods plus lots of stores will have lists of vegan items they carry online good luck,0
being trans is literally just performing exaggerated femininity transwoman or masculinity trans man wtf are you people on,1
i understand youre an edgy troll but this video is really hurtful ive been subscribed for years but after this i cant continue to support you youre misinterpreting what it means to be transgender and using it as a way to get attention,0
the fact of the matter is that when you look at the big picture women generally do not want the same job types as men far more men go into stem jobs like engineering mathematics science and technology those jobs pay way more as a result when you look at the total amount of money earned between men and women men make more but when you account for the differences in job types and education the wage gap vanishes to a much smaller amount  cents per dollar  not the  cents claimed to illustrate this point further white people only make  cents for every dollar that an asian person makes the reason is not because there is some discrimination going on it is the exact same reason that men make more than women as a whole this is because even more asians go into stem jobs than average caucasians wage gaps really have very little to do with discrimination it just so happens that women for whatever reason do not choose to go into higher paying jobs and do not choose to work as much overtime etc and it just so happens that asians go into high paying jobs even more that is why whites make  cents for every dollar than an asian makes and that is why women make  cents per dollar that men make its just looking at the total amount of money that a group makes it is not accounting for differences in what types of jobs different groups go into it does not account for voluntary overtime differences and it does not take into account educational differences etc its only looking at the total income of men versus women  and this produces a very misleading result,0
after all the shit ive seen on your twitter bitch obviously your fucking confused,1
sounds to me like shes transattention rather than transgender,0
ive been a vegetarian for most of my life go vegan from time to time i still can not give up my cheese but i promise to get there soon,0
always keep it easy and stupid,0
trishs eyes remind me of a fish her face is literally like this ,0
ororor we could start training young men and boys to start picking up their share of the child care and chores why does it have to be the womans job if men are equal to women then they need to man up and start acting like half their dna is in this child if men were able to say rearrange their tues and thurs schedules to make sure they were the ones to pick up the kids from school and take them to soccer practice and make dinner then the woman would only have to rearrange mon wed fri not to mention that if men were also held responsible for  of the care then businesses would have to start having more family friendly programs and hours because both fathers and mothers around  of the work force would be working around their babies just a thought,0
lmao a woman who doesnt know how research is done shares her opinion calling it fact,0
too bad sjw shouldve been born a man,0
what the world needs to do is depart from lawlessness and the rath of god will subside no amount of veganism or vegetarianism will save us from an angry god,0
all those parnets just want there daughter on top instead of the transgender females,0
monsanto and big pharma are loving this,0
jesus christduh yall have an un fair advantageyour men competing against women,1
as a trans person myself nonbinary to be exact its disgusting with all the misinformation youre spreading youre not trans youre delusional,1
im slowly going back being vegan wish me luck ,0
shane needs to go vegan next,0
that lady mad af be happy cause if they were white you wouldnt say anything,0
feministpropaganda against facts,0
honey u cant survive off fruit,0
greatat cult initiation film nothing but good news i know there are negatives to it ama,0
interesting that the people in dis documentary who claimed meat consumption was healthy looked particularly unhealthy and were mostly obese,0
call me transphobic i dont care these chicks are men,1
trisha  i recommend watching tess begg on youtube to get more inspiration for what to eat when you are a vegan she makes super good videos where she shows what she eats and how you can make it,0
this video was a long time in the making,0
equal pay act of  people want something to complain about so they dismiss variables and this is where this wage gap came from if you are a woman getting paid less than a man for the same work in the same job take it to court instead of complaining online,0
well done well done seriously well done,0
i dont think that transgender people dont know what they identify with if they know theyre trans,0
people shouldnt just become vegans they should eat healthy vegan food junk food comes in so many variations,0
heeeeerrrrrressss the triggered,0
try morning star vegan products you can get them at walmart they have bacon sausage and other meats that help with cravings,0
if a woman you know is earning less than a man for the exact same job you should call a lawyer women have equal opportunity in modernised countries which means that they are free to pursue the same careers that men do the fact that less women choose to do this is where the wage gap comes from its a result of a personal decision from a woman and if its problem then more women should be transferring to the higher risk jobs that men dominate through fair process not discrimination and closing that gap we dont need to look into the wage gap because there is no difference in womens earning for the same job there is no discrimination in this gap between incomes and therefore it isnt an issue this isnt a feminist argument this is a study of the choices women make and they make those choices not because of some form of oppression or patriarchy but because they have the freedom to choose their job and less women choose high risk high paying jobs it doesnt prove anything other than that im not saying people cant research it its quite interesting to observe human choices but im saying that this can never be used to advocate a feminist issue because the way it is misrepresented over and over again makes it sound like one and anyone who uses it as such is either intellectually dishonest or retarded,0
incorrectwoman are paid the same there was an entire law put in for this situationidiots,0
what i like is that this video explains it by using facts and not by shouting buzz words like sexist patriarcy mansplainers etc,0
she cant expect everybody to believe her when she came out as a chicken nugget she has been trolling for so long that it is hard to believe her and to tell whats genuine and whats not,0
scrolling through the comments to find the one positive comment that somehow excuses the k likes,0
go vegan best thing ever ,0
there are so many vegan options for protein such as beans legumes chick peaskidneybeans etc take a look through vegan instagram you will literally see tons and tons of pictures of delicious pizzasice creams desserts and delicious fruits and vegetables,0
the company i work for its not uncommon for men to work  hours a weekyet not a single women at the company works that same set of hoursthats all the proof you need,0
personally i think this is unfair to women who work hard everyday just to lose because of a unfair disadvantage edit wow thx for the like first of all wow second as a shotputter i see a lot of differences between boys and girls who throw with boys they usually throw a whole lot farther then girls at least from what i have seen usually guys throw like  or  usually girls throw like  i could only imagine what would happen if a guy changed to a girl and threw it would be total domination and would be very unfair,1
i disregard the whole video when your first statement is an obvious lie,0
trs encourageant  regarder  ,0
yas girl i actually had a feeling that you were going to try this now we both live in la so i have a few ideas if you wanna go out my favorite restaurants are veggie grill and vinh loi tofu theyre not the healthiest but it opens your mind to vegan food if you just wanna stay home and eat carb up with rice and potatoes and always make sure to have fruit now i know you dont like vegetables but give them a try because there are so many delicious ones,0
its the year of plantbased junk food this was a really good job of editing,0
dear trish kindness is not a sign of weakness but a manifestation of strength and resolution your mercy for others means everything ,0
the video there is no wage gap also the video even when we use sleezy techniques to eliminate the wage gap we still find a  difference,0
i swear to god she once came out as a fucking chicken nugget,0
in  years there will be male suffragettes,0
no shes confused or just being trisha tomorrow shell be a dolphin ,0
this got me thinking about intersexed people have they been allowed to compete i mean if someone is born both sexes then they might have an unfair advantage or not depending where they get placed to compete mens or womens sports i believe what used to be done in this situation was to just throw them into womens sports i do remember some news stories about this and i have to say it is rather unfair its not only unfair to the women but to the intersexed as well it would seem a solution would be start another division for intersexed but with so few births being so who would fund it on top of that it wouldnt be fair for transgendered to be thrown in with the intersexed division because of whos taking what hormone could have an unfair advantage so would a fourth subset for transgender athletes be needed again who is going to fund it it gets kind of crazy the transgender thing is one issue but what about those who are intersexed this idea of sports competition seems more legit because intersexed people arent choosing to be another sex like how it is said about transgendered should sports be off limits to the intersexed and if so wouldnt that be unfair so technically this is the same problem different issue,0
ok im reading lots of comments about how a teacher makes less than a ceo clearly people didnt watch the video its about fir the same job a ceo would definitely make more the argument were making is for the same job dont get butthurt about my opinion its what i think,0
sorry lady with a dick,1
awesome job pbn love it  ,0
just came here to say there are only  genders,1
woman are just incompetent in mathscience which are higher order skill set obviously men should be paid more and there should be a gap given man are more competent,1
living a vegan lifestyle is awesome,0
men are expected to be the bread winner theyre expected to work hard and always earn more money get more promotions etc etc women arent expected to work therefor when they do work they arent expected to work harder and they like men get paid for what they do meaning they get paid less,0
but what about the fact that men are more often considered for promotions that identical resumes with the only difference being gender result in the female being offered lower pay or flat out rejected why is it that the national womens soccer team pulled in more views on their world cup victory but was paid a fraction of the mens team who didnt even come close obviously theirs a lot of factors that come into all these calculations and a lot of good points are raised in this video such as the dangerous work conditions but i think with the information accessible it is still hard to discern where the issue lies women are more likely to be stay at home parents whereas boys are often more encouraged to pursue these high paying careers likewise that men are more willing to work longer hours and are very possibly more qualified i believe that their might still be a gender wage gap at play but its a lot more complex than a lot of people put it out to be in my opinion more research and information should be gathered in order to finally put this question to rest,0
wow thanks for this info i never knew the truth,0
yes there is,0
the biggest argument for there not being a pay gap is the equal pay act of  which made it illegal to discriminate against womens pay every year there is an average of  law suits over the violation of this law roughly  percent win thats  people a year can actually prove that they were discriminated against in the workplace thats mind bogglingly few people,0
her hair is great the layers oh ma gad also im really proud of her i wish i could do the same its quite difficult for me,0
those k dislikes is just pissed off feminists,0
what about actors and other enormously paying jobs isnt that the one feminists actually moan about not nurses and teachers,0
love you youre a huge inspiration the impact youve made on so many peoples lives is unreal,0
the difference between masculine energy and trans is that ftms need hormones and surgery to feel okay ugh i dont think youre being malicious but damn this is problematic,0
thats not right china did that in the olympic by putting older girls because they all looked like kids thats cheating plain and simple,0
i love freelees smug little face in the corner love you girl,0
dont forget gelatin nothing with gelatin,0
wheres the beef,0
the sneaky part is how aware they are they know they arent girls otherwise they wouldnt have to identify differently than their gender the minute you have to explain why you dont identify as your gender you simultaneously confirm your knowledge of your own biology the true sportsmanship spirit would to be compete against your own biology and attempt to prove that youre still stronger than them,1
they should ban transgender,1
have you forgotten about how men work more hours and that they are more productive and officient in the work place plus men take up the most work place fatalities because us men take up the more dangerous jobs like building or the military you didnt state this in the video and i think that you are choosing sides here vox,0
i just recently have found this channel love this channel blaire is fucking awesome i call her dig em because she smacks so hard,0
run your ass into a car,1
ugh i just just stop,0
ah so close you almost had it vox maybe next time,0
the wage gap is just the average earnings of men to women not even taking into account the jobeducation or hours worked,0
women in aggregate and men in aggregate have different work profiles so why would you expect them to have identical pay outcomes,0
waiting for all the vegans to come in like omg trish vegan isnt a diet its a lifestyle lmao but never mind the fact that she is still contributing to helping the environment,0
so happy youre doing this trish ,0
i dont know how people can dislike this video but i guess i shouldnt be surprised when the left cant understand facts,0
 i thought dominos australia introduced vegan pizzas in  or ,0
if she actually sticks with it and becomes a vegan it shows that literally anyone can do it really proud of her for going for it ,0
the fact that your doing this to stay relevant is disgusting the amount of disrespect this has towards actual transgender people is astounding your gross just stop,1
would like to see that pretty cool looking wage gap diagram at  minute mark for men and childless women hell include all  if you want no need to have the x axis being average pay,0
your brain cells grow when you dont take the bait true story shes like a rich coppercab,0
my theory is either she doesnt feel like shes getting enough attention or her self esteem issues are so intense that shes beyond confused,0
it was so insulting to all the other athletes when the father said that track isnt even that important to them this is the state tournament not just a regular track meet a lot of girls college plans may depend on these post season tournaments youre pushing your agenda and interfering with what the other girls have worked so hard for and its not even that important to you thats disgusting and selfish,0
glad you covered this youre one of my faves on youtube bad ass bitch,1
t or trish u do u why are people hating when it doesnt affect their lives unsubscribe if its that big of a deal hope your having a great tour,0
the gender wage gap by definition simply looks only at the average median earnings of both sexes therefore this video subconsciously agrees that it exists it simply misunderstood the definition as men getting paid more for equal work which rarely happens in developed countries,0
th dislike hell ya i got it,0
it doesnt exist,0
you can get milk made out of plants i enjoy soy milk with cereal at panera you can get a strawberry banana smoothie if you substitute the you hurt with almond milk you just have to ask them nuts are really good for omega  and other vitamins and proteins there are these vegan chicken patties and they are so good go to whole foods they have a lot of healthy vegan foods but also have vegan brownies so stay away from those if you want to lose weight if youre planning on going vegan for a while you need to do it to save the animals not just to lose weight i tried vegetarian to lose weight and i couldnt do it because i wasnt doing it for the right reasons you need to do it for the animals thats how all the committed vegans are doing it,0
been vegan for days now and my stomach issues are going away and i just feel better about myself,0
stop making the argument it all about the bs climate change nonsense just make it about ethics and compassion to animals that is the strongest argument,0
for the slaughterhouse videos somewhere in asia they beat dogs then eat the meat theres something sacred about eating dog meat when the dog was tortured alive any torture is depressing,0
wow what is the next thing youre going to do for attention jeeze go to therapy trish its one thing after another this is no my sincere at all how can anyone take this seriously she is is a compulsive liar i have anyways been a fan but youre just really trying do anything to get clout i would be so offended is i was trans,0
this is brilliant,0
i love trisha i have since i was  an im almost  now ive seen her when she was still stripping an was a escort ive seen the changes in her i feel like shes never had a healthy view of herself or the world if that makes any sense just like few years ago she came out an said she has a baby it was a black baby doll actually acted like michael jackson an hung over a balcony in one of her videos idk i feel like sometimes she just likes to act like her people thats her thing i noticed who ever shes around she becomes them almost also i feel like shed been better off saying shes more androgynous that likes femm boys idk maybe im wrong as well i do feel like she got a lot wrong in her video,0
their parents are equally shitty human beings,1
she was drunk or tipsy when she made that video,0
how come when someone says theyre a vegan it always is followed by the strict evidence of feeling positive pictures and data go a long way for us weird factbased people,0
sjws are gonna lover her  shes just genderfluid uwu,0
you were literally just eating chicken came from snapchat ,0
if you want a vegan frapp you can take soy milk and no whipped cream in the beggining it is hard to be vegan because your body is not used to it but after  days or so you will feel better then ever ,0
i am speculating that trisha is doing this for publicity i am not trying to invalidate her she has done so many things in the past for example she made people guess what kind of plastic surgery she got on her face like nobody cares about your plastic surgery dont preach self love and then get plastic surgery on every inch of your body there are people with real dysphoria out there,1
dried fruits and dried vegetables are so yummy especially dried strawberries,0
i love prageru videos,0
my parents are both pharmacists,0
omg finally im so happy for trisha i knew it would happen sooner or later,0
i wish i could understand this i really do,0
im so proud of you trisha i couldnt do that with the way my situation is rn im pretty sure my whole family wouldnt be much of help to the cause so thats whatever anyway dont give up,0
i mean with the system that we have its impossible to ever get to a discussion about the wage gap im not a woman i dont know what its like in the workplace as a woman im still a student i havent even worked before if you go on the internet and look for studies you will find what satisfies your agenda but you wont necessarily find things that accurately show the practical lives of women in the workplace unless you actually go through women to women telling everyone that they are experiencing all sorts of discrimination which are relatively unique to women men have their own problems theyre treated awfully in dangerous work they dont even get the proper care they need when injured they work longer hours and are even pressured at times to do so to the point where they want to do so a system in place to ensure that both men and women are paid the same for the same positions of the same jobs with the same level of commitment should be in place everywhere and there is really no denying that i couldnt care less about labels such as feminists or mens rights activists i care about the truth whether or not it challenges my own deeply held beliefs its really hard to face them but you have to do it or others and yourself will suffer,0
give this woman a medal already,0
funny trans men never make these kind of headlinesi never see them in line to join mma or boxing or any sport for that mattertrans women aint scared to end up in a female prison but trans guys sure are scared shitless to be fucked in a male prison cant people just use common sense,1
theres nothing wrong with eating humanely raised meat,0
the trick is what if you cant win goldjust cut away ur penus and compete with girls and bag gold,0
she isnt going veganshe is going plant based aka going vegetarian going vegan means avoiding animal products in makeup and everything else its not just food,0
freelee you look so tired and sad in this video i hope that everything is ok with you  the world needs you and your amazing work ,0
its a career and schedule gap most men i know have there  hour shifts lets say  but usually leave closer to about  plus as a business owner would you really want to invest more in a man who can do good work well into his s and s or invest in a women who is required to have at least  months maternity leave whenever she has a kid which means you gotta pay to fill her position either overtime or a temp whos hourly wage is higher than everyone elses what if she decided to have a kid every year youll get sued for trying to fire her plus at their s and s women go through menopause which studies done by women asking other women have shown that menopause reduces their productivity in the work place if you hire a  year old man for  years you get  good years of work if you hire a  year old woman for  years assuming she has  kids you get   years of work plus you get  months to  years of sub par menopause work hiring women is bad business,1
on the people who say it dosent exist you are sorta right if you factor out childbearing it disappears the wage gap is evidence of gender roles that negatively impact people,0
trans girls should not be on girls teams trans boys should not be on boys teams trans girls should not be on boys teams trans boys should not be on girls teams where trans people should be playing is in their own trans league it makes me sick that everyone has to be afraid to speak how they really feel because their pr and popularity can be ruined by people that are overly sensitive so much for the first amendment,1
when she first uploaded this i thought it was a joke her trolling so i didnt watch it was on a news page today and this video came up and they wrote about it so i was like hol up she was serious so i had to come back and watch this and this is just absurd i dont even know what to say lmaaaaooo,0
this is so awesome trish  but remember to eat other stuff too not just fruits beans veggies pasta rice lentils and so on good luck ,0
ive worked in industry for  years aerospace logistics and it and the only sex based bias i have found involved moving what few women there were into managerial positions i think this is because the few women they had to choose from when hiring were pretty incompetent and really most of them were worse than useless at the technical side of things they had no choice but to move them into management,0
trans should not exist,1
who the hell even is trisha paytas,0
how many young girls will give up on dreams of being elite athletes knowing they are going to have to compete head to head against weird men,1
i think you identify in being nuts,0
i love how she is reviewing fruit as if people dont know what grapes are hahaha,0
 ice cream taster sign me up,0
this is wrong,0
yes congrats  i personally eat mostly fruits until around  pretty much raw til  and then dinner is usually some sort of veggies sometimes cooked and later banana ice cream ,0
watch hot for food fruit is not the only thing you can or should eat,0
ms sommers youre absolutly correct love you d,0
this drastic lifestyle change may be difficult at first but i hope you dont quit without really trying and pushing through i used to be obsessed with eating meat chicken especially and went from eating it everyday to not eating it at all if i can do ityou can to i really hope you enjoy the vegan diet ,0
wage gap is fake news,0
trish wtf listen im not trying to judge but what you said dose not make you transgender and it is kinda insulting to me due to the fact thats i am a trans male ftm and and im not saying that your feelings are not there and real its just you should figure stuff out and learn about the lgbtq community before you go around saying that your this or whatever and keep in mind im not trying to be a ass whole im just trying to help you,0
this is biology and not about socialpsych choices absolutely ridiculous that they are allowed to compete stop it now the iaaf has ruled on this,0
off topic but your hair looks so soft,0
they just won again they are men they should not be racing against women i dont give a fuck what you feeel like yall are both men,1
this is awesome ,0
glad she didnt say patriarchy once,0
im not even in the trans community and i am straight as a board and this is fucking triggering,0
the track and field milli vanilli,1
i am ashamed that this is what my generation is becoming the entitlement is unreal,0
you turned trisha paytas wow you must not be as much of a fraud as everyone says right,0
the left lies to advance their agenda,0
why do female fashion models earn much more than male models is that reverse sexism the clothingfashionhairmakeupfragrance industries are obviously able to get a higher return on famous female models appearing in their marketing materials,0
the man tears in the comments are thick and heavy gain,0
just as she mentioned at the very beginning if there was a wage gap fire all your male workers and hire  females you will reduce  on your worker costs or would you rather pay an extra  to help the male world domination,0
your body has to get you to it and you might bloat at first but it will pass effortlessly dont give up veganism is actually super easy and way less expensive than meat diets you got this,0
this is out of control if the issue is being addressed as a girl then maybe sports should be categorized by chromosomes,1
yes i am so proud of you just make sure you eat enough calories and whole foods carbs are your friends love you,0
talk to channon rose haha thats my advice im not vegan,0
all i hear is yes but actually no,0
the fact that you choose to still have this upwhen youve deleted other posts much faster and far less offensive says it all this is beyond sad and offensive to anyone in the lgbtq community damn,0
listen carefully to what shes saying she sais she will be vegan two weeks before her music video no guarantee shell stay vegan after music video is done so for those who saw her eating meat on her snapchat the other day dont attack her she made it clear here,0
males and females are not biologically identical we do not have the same organs when a bull is castrated it becomes a steer not a cow,0
im having to time of my life rn watching kalvin garrah storm ryan and now blaire clown on this bitch,0
good work thanks,0
somebodys rent is due,0
really good educational video i suppose i am the only feminist not beliving in the wage gap though,0
fuck you yearwood and your wife,1
so two men who are clearly trash athletes as men decide to pretend they are women and are stealing the rightfull spots that belong to women,1
ugh the thumbnail is cringe,0
ive literally never been so excited about someone going vegan,0
i cant believe so many people upvoted this must be all the same altright nazi trolls that down voted amy schumers nauseating notcomedy special,1
 just run faster head,0
i can promise you after these two weeks you will feel so good and clean that you will want to keep going go trish keep researching and if you feel up to it read some literature on it  wishing you luck,0
can you please upload source link,0
i love your citations finally i have citations,0
based mom we are grateful for your excellent common sense,0
if this was narrated by a male so many more people would be mad,0
im down to support everyone but something has to change everywhere here why dont they just have a varsity and jv for everything dont do it based off of gender but skill instead every other sport has a varsity and jv although those are gender serapated this doesnt have to be theres no contact with anyone else being male or female wouldnt matter for anyone you make varsity if your fast enough and jv if your not simple,0
are factory produced vegan foods going to be healthier than traditional factory processed foods with all their refined sugars oils and salts or is this the food industry creating and cashing in on a new growing market,0
i dont hardly ever wear makeup and my favorite color is green and i could careless about fashion and i am a woman and i am not trans she is dumb,0
to the comments about this being old footage it honestly doesnt matter whether or not she has eaten animals since this doesnt matter because the journey to veganism is not easy for most people trisha may relapse multiple times what matters is that she is making the effort towards being vegan its important that she keeps going back to it and getting educated so that she can figure out what works best for her and eventually get to the place she wants to be if youre vegan yourself think about how hard it truly was to transition probably you had to make many enormous life changes so you could become vegan trisha is just really starting this journey finally realizing how veganism is a good thing and she should let it into her life cut her some slack this is an opportunity for education not for belittlement if you dont welcome her into the community she wont want to or have the resources to stay,0
please dont do the rawtill diet because people tend to eat a lot of calorie dense foods so unless you burn off all those calories then you will actually gain weight and also the diet reduce fat which is very unhealthy if you want to be alive,0
blaire your skin looks fuckin pristine,0
what an amazing film this gave me hope that we will see a vegan world some time in the future,0
in my heart ive always felt like batman but in my day to day i really feel like a dinosaur,0
the sheer amount of guttural fry that this narrator uses is very distracting you should investigate the relationship between a speakers credibility and their use of this type of speech pattern,0
brilliant bravo for the awesome work put into this video ive been vegan for almost  years and its heartening to see more and people around me shifting their food choices,0
ive seen thousands upon thousands of pigs go down a slaughterline though this is has been far more painful to watch,0
i just subscribed because you went vegan but unsubscribed because i found out you went off it,0
finally a women who speaks the truth and doesnt just try to attack men and doesnt just try to take over the world,0
this girl does have an amazing body that she works her ass off for much respect ,0
aaah yes we understand that the earnings gap is not caused by discrimination but by personal choices instead of accepting that there are just different financial decisions that most women make lets change the entire work schedule structure of jobs in order to benefit women who make different decisions yes this totally doesnt seem absolutely insane and idiotic at all nope not at all someonepleasehelpthisworld,0
also thats not true you cannot eat as much as you want even on a vegan diet there are vegan cakes cookies cupcakes ice cream and you cant just eat all of them just because theyre vegan you will still gain a ton of weight so the whole you can eat as much as you want on a vegan diet is absolute bullshit,0
finally huntyyyyy okay okay so im gonna start off by saying you probably gained weight on a vegetarian diet because of the dairy which is arguably worse then meat okay so some snacks you could do are potatoes literally potatoes are your best friend my favorite is japanese sweet potatoes because yes another thing is if you want to make something that requires eggs use flax seed eggs as a vegan alternative which you can get a target  as far as milk i prefer sweetened almond milk over soy milk,0
women going to mens would be pointless going the other way is the problem,0
best news in a while so extremely happy to hearsee this she will get the support she needs thank you for not giving up and standing up for veganism keep doing you girl,0
your hair gives me life,0
thats cheating plain and simple,0
lollet them race this is a discussion that needs to happen if they identify as women then they are women its unfair to say to these young ladies that you arent a woman when competing in sports but in other aspects you are i totally agree with the father he is trying to ensure that his child isnt damaged mentally by all the criticism i dont see anyone coming to the aid of these two girls to help fight their case or speak on their behalf what about women equality and all that other bs when they get involved in your sports i guess the rule changeok thats good to know like she said run faster train harder,1
now being a mom is damaging for women that kind of ideas are breaking families what we need to do it is to appreciate the importance of women as moms it is an integral part of our society i am not saying that men doesnt need to help more but you cant deny that there are things that only moms can do give birth breastfeeding etc,0
short hair and pants transgender male,0
gigi is on some shit,0
someone needs to really explain what transgender actually means to trisha clearly,0
this is why paternal leave is important ,0
trisha paytas  jessica jonathan yaniv  ever,0
 this has been debunked so many times,0
wow and i thought i was doing alright when i got out of business school i wasnt even in the same bracket as these men or women,0
i love the vegan movies thank you xx,0
you can do it trish focus more on saving the animals and less on trying to lose weight and this diet will eventually become a lifestyle proud of you girl ,0
freelee looks like a proud mom lol,0
i am sooo proud eat potatos i personally like cutting them up and baking them in the oven for fries eat tofu unless you dont like it but i used to not like it but now i love it dont be afraid to give foods a chance dont forget you live in la  as far as i know and its pretty easy to be vegan there ive heard there are many vegan resturants  best of luck gurl ,0
my reaction when i read the title  bahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahha breathes hahahahahahahahahahhahahahagahahahahhahahahahhahahahah,0
so the question remains why are fields in which men dominate paid more than the fields in which women lead the pay gap remains why are more men in the sciences that pay so well why arent more women in those fields is it a choice,0
for once im actually happy i got an ad on yt i really hope this vid spreads more so more people will know,0
  k is not   less than  k that would be  k you are obviously not qualified to talk about this or any subject that contains any numbers any claim of actual qualifications would instead disqualify you as ruthless liars willing to go to any lengths of dishonesty in order to sell your bullshit agenda nice try though,0
not a complete lie but women cant expect to get the same amount of money after being knocked up and in maternity vacation for several months  or  times in their career,0
tofu is badass if you do it right cube it dry w paper towel and season my go to seasoning is garlic powder salt and pepper then pop it in the oven at  for about  mins my mom says they taste like crouons and she hates tofu,0
glistening in the wind  blair white,0
what the hell has happened to her she looks like shes had a good few months on crack also there is absolutely no way to be transgender and identify with the sex that you were born as,0
you can get any drink at starbucks made with coconut milk,0
ridiculous go carnivore,0
one thing i learned is to not over stuff yourself still eat as much as you want but dont feel like you need to eat  bananas in one meal if you feel like you need to though you do,0
whats the wage gap between the  genders,0
so you are basicaly sayng man are paid more cause they are ready to be humble and work obnoxious hours i guess thats fair ladies i am waiting for you in the steel factory to clean some furnaces at  degres celsius a in the morning on a weekends to shorten the wage gap together power to the shovel,0
we live in a meritocracy work hard and youll get money,0
honestly what the fuck did i just watch,1
bro i just recently rediscovered blaires channel i had run into it before once but it was a video on a topic i already had all the current info on so i clicked off this is gold this is so dope i hope this channel blows up forever,0
video came out  minutes ago and people already disliked,0
im dying the whole transgender community speaks to me  well if i get them they would omfg trish you kill me ,0
i personally wouldnt follow freelees rawtillfour as much as hes a jackass vegan gains response video has some good advice and like you said kalels what i ate in a day videos are ace and dont feel like its all or nothing at the moment if you can keep it up for  weeks thats greatbut a lot of people find the cold turkey way doesnt work for them so maybe try going vegetarian for a few weeksthen cutting out eggsthen switching to nondairy milk in drinksetc,1
i dont wear make up and i dont dress in overly girly things guess im a man now ,0
finally someone spoke sense on this matter do you think youll be making more member videos in the future btw,0
question for blaire when i hear the term transgender and of course the first person i think about is you i find the term no longer applies to you as far as i can tell youve finished your transformation meaning youre no longer a mf transitioner and anything else you do be it oh idk liposuction nose job bigger titty implants anything short of the salami slice none of those things except the last which i selectively put a condition on are going to create a secondary sex characteristic that you dont already have i mean youre gorgeous and you know it lets not bullshit with each other reason i say this is because some of these other unicorn genders were see like justin dennis nonbinary trans woman bullshit or any of the other transtrender assholes youve dissected in your videos there certainly have been a lot of them they wouldnt qualify as trans either since they are making a declaration of an imaginary gender and have no intention on transitioning to a male or a female meaning the term trans is a meaningless word which i must say is not only offensive to my intelligence but should be offensive to your integrity as a transitioned male to female ill just call you female from here on but i think you get what i mean if not ill clarify,0
i would like a link to the cite where you found your studies,0
someone please help me go vegan i used to be vegetarian and i had so much energy but now i am addicted to meat yeah addicted i need help,0
there simply is no wage gap,0
is it that you hate the toxic societal standards the world holds you to or because all that shit is relatable and i feel so many of these feelings while still being cis like idk you do you and its not my problem but still youre describing the feelings that so many activist women feel,0
you will not gain weight   im with nicacado eat starches to keep you satisfied at the very least after raw all day,0
see its not discrimination or misogyny its a functional problem,0
shes talking so fast like damn,0
dude what the fuck are you on,1
i think something ppl should remember is everybodys walk to finding who they areis different i went through a time where i thought i was bi before i even knew what it meant i told people but i have never been with a chick over time i realized i was confused on my identity which makes sense for the mental illness i struggle with it could be a similar thing,0
lmao its funny how   people still think they should get paid more for no reason,0
lol this girl needs to ask the doctor first lol i tried and have thyroid and he took me off just eating veggies being vegan is sooo bad for us good luck with the hospital visit,0
so if we will make  on the dollar i should hire only women to save money because a man would be  more expensive why should i hire menhmmmmmmmmmmmm,0
as if it was about testosterone the male body has a whole different metabolism that allows it to grow muscle bigger and stronger than females females also have bigger hipbones which is less efficient to carry heavy weight than the male one,0
things are so confusing these days,0
cant wait for freelees reaction,0
 waves painted nails at the camera,0
boi straight guys dont always have masculine energy you can be i forgot but its when your attracted to femisism,0
did she blink,0
this isnt sensitive its sickening any woman who supports this crap is helping their own gender be wiped out by men women finally have the same rights as men and now we are allowing them to take over our gender and completely wipe us out,1
warning might be trollz below,0
here is an other idea too in divorce the higher wage earner should get custody of the kids think of what is best for the children,0
ive been vegetarian for six months and dairy free for one month and now i have officially gone vegan and its been about a week im so happy,0
wage gap is the average money a women makes a year this doesnt consider days off and sick days i hate to teach you this we mon take more days off than men and thats a fact,0
follow mommytang shes got yummy recipes,0
i really enjoyed this film thank you,0
oh girl you are love but this isnt it ,0
preach it sister,0
you must join vegan junk food group on facebook called what fat vegans eat  its amazing and theres tons of people showing what amazing vegan food they eat both healthy and fast food ,0
i wonder whats the gender pay gap between all of the infinite genders,0
im so happy for you i am a vegan also and i just wanna give you some tips so you dont make the same mistakes i did i went vegan after watching freelee and at first i lost a ton of weight cause i still ate a normal ratio of macronutrients carbs protein fat and ate a reasonable amount for my body weight once i started taking freelees advise i developed binge eating disorder no of course that is not completly freelees fault but her emphasis on smashing in the carbs led me to trying to eat as much as her then i eventually got used to it i ended up gaining even more than i lost originally my triglycerides in my blood test were too high and i was struggling with digestive issues and energy level issues i am still struggling with binge eating to this day two years later but try as hard as i can to actually eat only when im hungry not out of boredom and stop when i feel good and satisfied rather than overstuffed and feeling like im gonna explode,0
she fucking with yall she knows shes not trans its trisha paytas,0
well cuz theyre guys so,1
scumo is possibly the worst pm australia has ever had and its a pretty fucking hard contest,1
check out channels like hot for food lauren toyota edgy veg raw vegan not gross nikki limo is also doing great vegan food lately,0
 is the gap,0
almost every single home building or structure you have ever seen was built by a man almost every single car made or road you have driven on was built by a man almost every business of the fortune  companies was started by a man i know easier to ask for or expect equal pay than to actually put in the hard work if you want equal pay or job titles go start a company or build something from the ground up coming in asking for equal pay or ceo title status after a man has done everything is absurd there better be a pay gap,1
just be honest and admit that this is a problem,0
i hate the paper sound effects in this video,0
 was my first year as a vegan no doubt,0
just wanted to clarify that ive been subscribed for  years now but somehow youtube unsubbed me so i had to sub back been happening alot lately and its so wierd,0
last person i thought would go vegan but good for her,0
the thing i dislike about these videos is the fact they name a source such as the us department of labor studies and use it to prove choice is to blame and dont link it anywhere in their videos,0
went vegan cold turkey in  was off and on until the beginning of  when i decided to do it the right way and gradually cut down vegetarian for almost all of  and then just went back to being vegan about a month ago i regret not doing it sooner im so much happier,0
gardien meatless meat is the best,0
hey banana bitches really my sister was watching a video of you and heard your swearing and though it was cool and she was swearing too shes  thanks for ruining my little sisters innocence plus now shes banned from your channel you lost a subscriber i dont watch you and personally i dont like you but just wanted too let you know ,0
being vegan was the best thing for me you can still eat a normal diet but substitute animal products it can be easy to eat veggie burgers and tofu but processed foods still arent the best i eat a lot of rice and beans thats very filling i put beans into my salad for protein i love to eat pasta and jarred tomatoes for dinner and just fruit throughout the day for snacking good luck,0
 oh ,0
of course they do there fucking men lol jesus wtf has happened to the world,1
lol thats my only comment,0
that intro was a mood,0
remember carnage the movie simon amstell made a couple of years ago about a vegan future set in  watching this is like watching that movie except that its real the vegan future really is coming feeling very hopeful for ,0
yeah thats an earnings gap,0
finally a women that actually understands the definition of equal,0
she knows what shes doing,0
ive never seen so many thumbs down on a video in a long time im pleasantly surprised trisha stop this i mean she could be gendefluid but sometimes she just does stuff for publicity shes for sure not a man at least,0
you should never eat a whole bundle of bananas just for breakfastg carbs in each,0
why is this even a problem its all about choice they earn more college degrees than men so they have more opportunities its up to them to take it how is this even a feminist issue,0
so proud of you keep it up girl,0
would have liked to see a segment dedicated to all the hard working animal rights activists and sanctuary founders frankly quite disappointing,0
try explaining this to a feminist  your likely to get pepper sprayed,0
i agree with the video it makes great points but i have seen my friend be paid less than her male counterpart for the same job and she worked very hard so i do believe it does exist just not as much as it did,0
freelee i really appreciate how you end your videos with you dont have you like me you just have to hear me of course i think youre a great person and that quote constantly reminds me of how humble you are,0
im still trying to figure out what average business major makes kyear,0
this channel is a circus,0
as a trans man you are a fucking disgusting attention seeking cunt,1
you as parents should be ashamed of yourselves has your son removed his penis,0

petroleum engineering is my ream job and i can say that i have never met a girl that likes organic chemistryso women stop whining and open a chemistry book,1

check jess beauticians channel i always reccomend her because her food is easy and tasty and she includes recipes for just about everything i just started my own vegan journey  months ago and it was kinda hard so im wishing you all the best luck in the world keep being your sweet and sunshiny self ,0
going vegan is a lifestyle change so it will take a bit of time cut things out slowly so you dont go cold turkey and end up reverting back to eating animal products grains such as rice and quinoa and fruits and vegetables and beans are my go tos but there are so many vegan fake meats out there so if youre craving it go for that also oreos and diary free ben and jerrys are always there if you need a sweet fix,0
is it possible instead of pharmaceutical commercials we could buy up the entire first commercial break on abcnbccbs nightly news to finally end this nonsense,0
after years of being debunked vox tries to claim credit for the clarification that the wage gap is actually an earnings gap still tries to push the narrative that the gap is unjust and should be closed,0
watching her face appear after yoursdamn,0
what about makeup and clothing products that arent animal friendly ,0

glad to know im not alone in her wanting to make an onlyfans,0
freele youre amazing love you ive been vegan for a year now ,0

ohh i like you,0
shes all over the place couldnt even finish the video,0
make sure you eat lots of green leafy vegetables kale spinach watercress all that good stuff theyre all super high in protein and give you lots of energy to help you get through the day love you lots trisha,0
ok but why do we perceive female dominated professions as requiring less skills and money etc for example computer programming and coding was considered a low level menial job when it was female dominated yet now coders make oodles of money and the job has a lot of respect we respect physicians yet in russia where medicine is a predominantly female workforce they have no respect for the profession there librarians were once respected and well paid and even now when they have more skills and education than ever before they are laughed at and paid like shit ever since females started dominating the profession teaching was also the same i dont think women are paid less for simply being women i think we value male work over female work if you compare education levels for different jobs you will find that in female dominated industries they will be lower paying than similar levels of education than in male dominated industries since women have taken over the field of biology the median wage has gone down  wages for designers fell by  when females started to gain ground in the industry of the  top highest paying professions  are male dominated,0
and wait you were with freelee dont even try to be like her just chill tf out you look dumb going vegan bc of someone elses body especially the biggest bitch on youtube,1
congratulations you bullied trish into being vegan,0
there probably is a gender wage gap but i dont think its a problem im sure it just happened to be this way and in a few years itll go the other way,0
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttt make sure you do your research and eat enough calories so that you eat enough and are not hungry,0
i identify as im gonna kill myself after all the bs i just heard,0
how amazing not necessarily the vegan part but how you  who had hate now became friends  amazing   love you both,0
i call bullshit,0
shes not vegan anymore,0
this is totally stupid,0
is her accent normal im a foreigner so i cant tell but she sounds like a jimmy fallon impersonation of a teenage girl eew i probably misinterpret her intonation the content is very interesting and i find her viewpoint very interesting but i couldnt shake her accent,0
im confused because it seems that the outfit youre wearing and hair etc is the same as when you went to shanes premiere and since then youve been eating meat etc,0
you guys were born a dude,1
trisha what the hell are you talking about,0
fuck vegans there weak asf,0
wait a minutefacts dont belong in politics xd,0
exactly if women can be paid with such a low salary then why not most companies hire women instead of men for certain jobs there are reasons for these wage gaps and its not merely women are seen as being incompetent women are expected by society to dedicate their time for their family while men are expected to feed his family so men can spend more time on their jobs,0
eat carbs like bread rice veggies soups fries fruits and just make dishes using all of these and they will turn out great hope you do the vegan diet correctly and stay vegan for life good luck,0
america should be only white blond haired blue eyed men everyone else get out side of the wall make america great again,1

you know damn well youre not going to last a month,0
lets do this together,0
yeah as if you would ever go through with it all talk and no actual change as per usual,0
why do they always point to women doing the majority of child raising like men need to do halve that work to on top of the fact that they never say yes women do most of the child raising and thats because men still pay either though taxeschild support ect the majority of the cost of child raising,0
definitely if youre going to go vegan look for sprouted food like sprouted bread and sprouted brown rice potatoes are great too for when youre really hungry carb the fuck up mate some people like soy milk i grew up with almond milk it really depends on your preference also for starting out if you still crave cheese daiya has some really great products and really just try to get fresh organic produce,0
veganism is gonna be so trendy in the next couple of months if youre not vegan youre not cool lol,0
trisha u can make most things at starbucks vegan by asking for coconut milk or soy milk coconut is sweet so i get that and no whip cream ,0
im sorry but at this point i feel like there is nothing you wont say or do for views if its true cool awesome cool but you will do almost anything to stay relevant i use to support the crap outta you until you posted a video making out with your couch,0
ive watched trisha since  and i do not think shes trolling because she has said these same things before she made a video in  called gays i wanna bang and she says it sucks to be in a womans body but do i think shes trans noi think shes uncomfortable by societal standardsnot by her own body sis wants to be mom and have children for goodness sake,0
can people send me links to these studies and more if you guys have any im trying to dispute some girl and she wants statistics and data  help me ,0

when they had higher testosterone thru puberty their bone structure is more dense which equals more muscle mass hormone therapy wont change that,0
out of all the things youve done lol this actually really bothers me so many limitations and misconceptions youve put on others including yourself dont cater to a label were all individuals hope youre doing okay trish theres just so many things wrong with your claims,0
im confused why people comment refuting the gap when the video confronts most of the arguments people use to disprove its existence that study of those graduates from business schools makes it seem pretty concrete that for one reason wemon typically working less hours due to social pressures that make them more likely to handle the bulk of child rearing or another out right discrimination it exists,0
oh come onsince when does youtube not notify us of new videos if we dont follow you on all the socials i dont follow you there because i dont use social media im a bad millenniallol yet i get notified every time  i know im not the only one im just a more extreme case which actually supports what im saying even more so that doesnt seem completely honest,0

so the solution is raise your kids equally in time,0
as a man how can you call your son her or she,1
blaire always setting this shit straight much love,0
my brain while watching this ,0
yes we need to change things but seriously we cant turn back the old ways of the th century we have over  billions of people to feed and in  that will over  billion farming with just your hand wont do it this idealistic view is one of the reason why people think vegan are just a bunch of idiots can we please get some better stuff instead of constantly citing the hippies from california,0
effing cheater you steal the true glory from females that work hard to earn it,1
its not a question of whether or not there should be a wage gap its a question of what that wage gap should naturally be given all the advantages that women are given the wage gap should probably be wider if we keep social engineering the disharmony between men and women will continue,0
 time you were waiting for your welcome,0
freelee you have inspired me sooooooo much the second i looked at farm to fridge my stomach turned i can not believe what monsters they are i love you sooooooo fricking much and you have changed my whole vision on meat fish and chicken all of that stuff as well as dairy so now i am  vegan thanks to you  i love you sooooooo much,0
gender identity nope biology dont give a fuck about that ur a male or a female and biologically males essentially have the advantage sportswise make it fair not pc,1
when the hell the trish turn trans im i have absolutely no problem with any one trans but really reallyyyyy tho sis need to eat frfr cause she looks like she is about to fly away smh what the hell is she on about lmao omg,1
if you watch her other videos its obvious shes going through some kind of mental breakdown there was a video of her literally rhyming about having boobs so i wouldnt take her video so seriously i think she needs help,0
glistening in the wind ,0
couple years later sjw will be screaming that there are no longer any sport records that would belong to women tyrannical patriarchy  they will say guess whos going to be responsible for that,0
no trisha is a ftt from female to troll no offense to our community ofcourse im non binary,0
i give it  days,0
good luck you protein is found in many other food groups like beans greenvegetables and grains such a misconception ive transitioning to vegan and i feel so much better and increasing exercising,0
st century feminism is a cancer of society,1
do more of these videos,0
wow vox made a video i actually think is well put together and i agree with,0
 joey without him probably wouldnt be vegan thank you team joey,0
now its ok to mixanything goes as long the lower class stay low ,0
this is ridiculous tricia but okayyyy,0
love this shit,0
uh no shit its unfair thats not even a debate,0
yep is the gender winge lie,0
trishas video is just nasty she makes coming out as trans look like a fun thing to do and all of us can say its not fun i lost my guy friends because they couldnt understand anything i was going through they were my best friends we were inseparable and now i see them hanging out doing all the things we did together things i showed them without me coming out as trans isnt fun it sucks that it is the way it is but for most people they risk almost everything when they come out trisha is literally just hunting for clicks and its gross shes profiting off of our pain,1
i have nothing personal against lgbt yet even a baby would know this is unfairstop,0
if the wage gap comes down to women choices then why would we seek to change them if women choose to earn less and spend more time on family who are you to disagree they arent being hurt  this is not sexism its free people making free choices,0
gender wage gap is a myth case closed,0
having short hair doesnt make you trans,0
i am on the road to recovery from blind meat consumption vegan ,0
your one of my favourite you tubers and i think its time for you to make a huge change in your life  your a very beautiful woman but your food choices are killing you not only physically but work wise you would have much more opportunities if you opt for a more healty diet and loose a couple inches i also think you should embrace minimalism and travel the world that would fulfil the emptiness you feel sometimes i wish you all the best and i have a request  could you show us your closet and do you ever get ride of stuff muah,0
i never thought u would be vegan lmao you can try instead of meat tofu actually it kind of taste almost the same as meat its delicious and healthy also remember vegans kind of eat more than omnivores make sure you eat enough calories in day,0
these are dudes of course they have an advantage if the best wnba team played  games against the worst nba team the woman would lose every time,1
equal pay act of ,0
you stupid bitch,1
lol the comments are just im a vegan hahaa i eat meat ,0
hmm so my military experience schooling and various community dealings should account for nothing in regards to my payscale i suppose the way i see it is the men are almost always doing the manual labor positions they are the primary individuals fighting wars and i respect the fact that this video didnt come off as how i initially thought it would,1
as someone who is transgender i think you are confusing being ftm transgender with thinking that life would be easier as a man theres a big difference you need to go see a therapist to work through these feelings rather than sharing it on social media,0
hi freelee ive been watching through a lot of your videos recently and you have been such an inspiration that i really think i wanna go vegan in the near future luckily im moving back onto campus in  weeks where ill have access to a full kitchen and away from my large family that i live with who makes having a different eating lifestyle a difficult task but my main concern is will i be able to make sure my body is getting what it needs i have problems with my appetite and rarely feel hungry the act or even just the thought of eating most of the time makes me nausous and dizzy its extremely unhealthy i know and i wanna work towards fixing it have you encountered anyone who had this problem what kind of tips can you recommend on ways to make sure ill be eating enough to live heathily on a vegan lifestyle it would mean the world to me if you could point me in the right direction or if anyone else has any words of wisdom,0
shes been mething around to much jesus christ,1
praise the vegan gods im screaming go trisha for hopefully truly going vegan,0
i can be butch as fuck but definitely still female lmfao,0
what wasnt mentioned is that women are generally secondary earners for a family taking parttime jobs only to supplement the couples gross earnings but that would have really pissed off the feminists,0
 bullshit insanity this is the world sjws wantutter chaos and total loss of normalcy why dont they take up womens boxing and mma to show what the insane sjw world can really look like,1
yaaaaaayyyyy im so hapyy that shes doing that,0
that bitch boy had a  oclock shadow,0
buffalo cauliflower bites are delicious id recommend going to julians vlogs to watch jjs kitchen jenna is vegan and julian eats gluten free so its worth a look,0
you cannot have fried food unless its without egg how do you not know that,0
beause men are agressive enough to sue,0
so i saw a video were she said she didnt believe egipt was a real place like she really is very stupid geez,0
this is not fairhe has a penis and muscle mass,1
here goes fatso trolling againchicken mc nuggets dont countwt an idiot this is how the piglet makes money and people like me responding because shes such an idiot she better stay away from the slaughter house they might try to slaughter her,1
lol its trish shes meant shes not eating meat on cam lol,0
shes clearly just genderfluid and isnt familiar with what that jank means,0
i want to be vegan only because i hate how many animals die a year  billion and i hate how bad theyre mistreated its disgusting,0
women should be the ones most upset with this to work for equality and to train hard for a sport only to have the success taken away from you and then not being able to speak up because you will be considered transphobic a person has the right to be what they want to be but a biological born male should never compete in women sports period its just not fair,1
riley dennis mtf lesbian trisha ftm gay drag queen omg i think this just became a legit thing,0
always always be smart and ask questions when you go out to eat dont buy animal products just because the rest of ur friends are you have to keep motivated and with veganism your have to eat a larger volume of food to get more calories because plant foods are less calorie dense which is sometimes the reasons why you can get full easier since ur stomach is much more filled up than with a small piece of meat at the bottom of your stomach and also keep track of vitamin intake youre most likely going to lack in vitamin b so maybe purchase a supplement or fortified foods to help overcome that and also a lot of plant foods contain nonheme iron which is harder to absorb than heme ironin meats but to fix that you need to keep up your vitamin c levels  orange juice vitamin gummies in order to absorb it more efficiently and protein should be fine if you eat more lentils and quinoaespecially quinoa because it is a perfect proteinthats my advice for u good luck,0
literally just listen to the first  seconds of this video,0
the guys need to compete against other guys that think they are girls what a joke what ever happened to title  you leftist dumdums,1
or in other words there is no wage gap only people working diffrent hours,0
so this video is incorrectly titled there is a wage gap it just isnt as high as most people think,0
i love this conservative channel if the jewish american business society had a youtube channel this would be it point one of sexism  getting a woman to speak about the wage gap because she is a women good job i think you fundamentally failed at your there is no wage gap if conservative statistics put it at  cents that is still a wage gap and much less than the actual figures,0
so happy for you,0
b u l l s h i t s e x i s m p r a g e r u i s a j o k e,1
love for you freelee but i dont believe trisha at all,0
shes crazy period,0
freelee reacted to it on her channel haha,0
good luck trish keep at it its going to be very hard as meat is very addictive but if you keep at it you can do it,0
this girls body was fucking sick god her voice is ear piercing,0
wish i had this video ready to go for my socialgy class on sexism  my professors head would have exploded ,0
amazing going vegan for two weeks is better than nothing at all so awesome ,0
i think trisha  needs to quit doing drugs  quit doing mukbangs  stop putting a trashy amount of collagen in her lips and  get the hell off youtube sorry i cant stand trisha shes toxic histrionic narcissistic outofcontrol impulsive lies through her teeth and is probably a psychopath,1
you look like a pot smoking milf in this video oh wait you aleready are,1
go ahead and shit on me but early childhood education shouldnt require a degree to me please prove me wrong did you not learn everything you needed to besides problem solving from the core  ,0
do you honestly think someone that fat will stick to a vegan diet for long lol no fucking way,1
omg so happy you made her vegan and that she is vegan now ,0
damn trisha can you please slow down when you talk i have to play back every time are you conscious when you do that,0
we eat whole plant foods with least ount of processing not sure all the fake meat is good but probably better than animal products as to the environment it might be too late but at least we can go to hell with a clear conscience,0
please react to niomi smart new video about cruelty free make up please freelee,0
wow so inspiring it takes so much courage to take advantage of social pressure and outrage culture in order to use your biological advantage to win at sports,1
its good to have vegan people so the meat eaters can have sufficient meat for them go vegan thanks for saving the meat for me,0
i have no job i am paid  less than average what the hell,0
i was in costco taking a picture of beyond meats pizza a woman wanted to know why i was i told her i wanted to post it on my facebook pagei told her beyond meat was not targeting vegansbut they are trying to reach flexitarians she had not heard of flexitarians but felt this is an approach she wants to try to follow,0
trish so do i think im transgender  also trish but do i also identify with my natural born gender ,0
i need help my riding mower is now identifying as trans and it refuses to mow anymore how should i proceed,0
i think shes just doing her best to stay relevant in any way ,0
positive discrimination is never fair,0
s new urban dictionary troll  trisha paytas,0
this is legendairy ,0
i agree there is no real discrimination but i think that family contributes to this gap women are the primary caretakers of children therefore they take more time off work and men as the breadwinners often have to find a second job to support their families i believe there needs to be done to minimize that gap since too many men are experiencing too much stress and too many women are earning less which means also less savings and a smaller pension for them in the future,0
yay this is such heartwarming news,0
they ate men this is bullshit,1
there are a ton of like frozen vegan meals you can get but be careful bc some taste like trash theres is like vegan ice cream and a ton of yummy meals that other vegan youtubers share online ,0
hunter avalone any thoughts,0
ughhh vox was so close to admitting the wage gap doesnt really exist for sexist reasons so close,0
bruh i miss when she thought she was a chicken nugget,0
im so happy right now i love you im so happy right now i am just so happy thank u ily ily yay yayayayayayyayaya,0
youre cute i like you and your personality,0
blaire i love you but the cringe is strong with this one will most definitely be buying the pronoun shirt,0
i expceted vox to get this completely wrong,0
the wage gap is just the average meaning its a generalization of the who earns more money key word is earns first of all women work more low paying jobs its not sexist if a women chose to be a nurse and not a engineer nothing is stopping them from choosing to be an engineer in fact they are helped into it by affirmative action if a woman does become an engineer and works less hours it isnt sexist if she is working in a lower paying field like mechanical not civil it is not sexist nothing is holding women back they just dont value money as much as most men they usually prefer a job with more stability rather than a private business if a man is a doctor and a woman is earning less as a nurse they made different life choices it isnt a super natural invisible entity called patriarchy its free choice,0
if u want to lose weight with a vegan diet than keep it clean no processed foods all whole plant based meals,0
i love when femenist say that men steal their jobs then right after they bring out the wage gap if that were the case then why would business even hire men in the first place,0
theres vegan makeup,0
your body your choice your responsibility,0
watch mommy tang she has turned me to soooo many vegan easy ass recipes,0
maybe i am a feminist bc i knew women have it way more harder than men i simply scared of childbirth and pain of period we have to deal it every month and to see men are free from that burden im just jealous like women are more prone to sexual harassment abuse bc women are weaker im sad bc everywhere i only see that women are viewed as sex object when it comes to logical and analytical skills men tends to be more good i sometimes jealous of the boys bc they can understand math and science more quickly than me or sometimes the girls maybe im way too objectify to the genders but idk im just sad why we get all the hard things this is just my thoughts peace i really really want to be a boy lol,0
run faster hahahah coming from the one born with the physical advantages,0
take that feminazis,1
okay trisha where is the proof i know you gave us the picture but where the medical reports and the papers,0
their boyspoint blank period,1
then again equality doesnt exist,0
it logically makes no sense to have children if we are paid less and treated like second class in our relationships,0
the weaknesses of the video are as follows they still insinuated that discrimination was a factor as they failed to mention otherwise they didnt talk about wage negotiation they neglected to mention that most women choose to raise children and yes there are studies that give a clear indication that both men and women prefer this to working so it is indeed a privilege for women to do so and perhaps most importantly they failed to mention that these industryspecific differences are literally everything to do with specialisation and earned promotion,0
who came from freelees new video,0
trisha i dont like being harassed my straight guys is this being transgender,0
where are the veggies,0
im so happy and proud trish,0
so men who work with nuclear fusion should get paid less because of the boo hoos of women,0
trisha i am so proud of you panic not about what you can and cant eat just make sure its not animal products and you will be totally fine i eat lots of fruit and then in the evening i eat pasta  sauce with veggies or veggies and rice with a sauce of some kind ill tweet you some nice recipes you can try these next two weeks will be easy if you keep it simple ive learned a lot since going vegan including being less militant please please please vlog your two weeks itll be so good to watch and support you ,0
damnit i want a gif of you saying im deceased for all my reactions,0
for  minutes vox shows that the wage gap is actually an earnings gap but somehow still calls it a wage gap throughout,0
calls it a wage gap shows earnings gap wonders why no one takes them seriously,0
 if women only make  cents for every dollar a man makes why dont businesses hire just women explain that women who take advantage of the wage gap myth to earn more than men,0
ive been vegan since may th i love it so proud of you girl this made my week and some of my favorite recipes are rice and black beans mixed with saracha you know the spicy stuff and som pepper for breakfast i love overnight oats with a lot of fruit or a smoothie bowl or hclf pancakes or pasta or i a lot of potatoes then when im hungry i slice them out them on the gorge formen grill then put some pepper and garlic and lemon juice i love it love it love it and theres soooooo many more,0
im sorry but trisha is just some dumb bimbo tbh,1
here in new york women actually outearn men,0
also the more men helping in households and with parenting becomes normal the less of a gender issue this will be i think this is not about giving rights to women i think this is giving rights to women and men thats why its so important for men to support feminism,0
good for you trish,0
the vegan cult is strong very strong,0
they should not be able to compeat agenst biological women,1
shame you missed the factors that were not taken into account in this study namingly location of the job think the dif between new york and alabama choice of job they followed mba graduates for the study cited but an exec at a bank will make more than an exec at a company with  stores hours worked per week in thomas sowells study which took these into account the pay gap between men and women was at most  cents on the dollar with the female working  less hours per pay cycle additionally in most jobs where a woman was unmarried and had no kids she tended to outearn an unmarried no kids male by a large margin by  years post graduation,0
im sorryi just think that shes caused too much shit in other communities shes trying to come for this one i feel like shes told so many lies and came up with dumb ideas for clicksi honestly dont doubt that shell post another video saying no i changed my mind because i got the coin,0
you dont have to be perfect from the start you can make mistakes you can learn from it,0
so who paid pierce seems like a grown man should have a reaction better than a year old so weird,0
kmmmmmimmmbmmkmmimmmkmmkmmkmmimmmkmmk the sweetest vegan makes a delicious vegan bacon cheeseburger i make them once a week,0
nice video dislikes were from batshit crazy feminists and people who didnt watch the video women make less than men because they do less work short and simple,1
ymy unvle has been a vegan for about  years and he says that a good way to eat healthier with a vegan diet is lots of beans and nuts you can buy beyond meet products and simple truth if there is a kroger or smiths in your area and for cheese you can buy daiya products and another source of protein is seitans they are really delicious wheat protein they are great for vegetarians and vegans i hope you do well on your vegan journey and that you enjoy the healthier and satisfying things in life,0
im disappointed that you didnt mention the affects of race on the gender pay gap,0
thank you for telling the truth this fake wage gap is constantly used to justify hatred against men whats funny is as ms sommers says it doesnt even make any mathematicalbusiness sense,0
so lets get this straight she identifies with her natural born gender yet she is transgender shes attracted to gay men yet she is bisexual,0
good for you trisha im going to start as a vegetarian and see how that goes to transfer into a vegan,0
youre so right its a fad and it really is ruining it for people who are genuinely trans and so on,0
very hard for men to give birth until that changes this non issue will always be like this,0
i miss the gender wage gap too good ol days,0
the question now is why do woman go to the worst jobs this question isnt over,0
make sure youre eating enough food otherwise youll crash and feel awful i would eat all of the food you showed within a few hours idk how long you planned on them lasting but it probably wont last long theres so much you can eat pasta with marinara and veggies rice with steamed veggies and soy sauce pizza topped with tons of veggies and no cheese if you want to stick to low calorie foods you can always make tons of salads whole foods carries a bunch of vegan salad dressings that are bomb vegan ceasar vegan blue cheese vegan honey mustard etc theres also vegan grilled chicken strips that you can add to the salad or you can make wraps look into veggie burgers theyre usually low calorie and very filling the qrunch brand quinoa burger is so good and made of nothing but quinoa and vegetables quinoa has a ton of protein you can made smoothies out of frozen bananas other fruits and fruit juices add some spinach or kale for more nutrients good luck happy for you,0
i dont think ive ever seen so many dislikes on a video bravo ,0
trisha must be the best troll on the internet xd,0
no youre not pretty much vegetarian you either are or youre not just like being vegan you are or youre not and also dont tell people not to watch videos on the cruelty behind slaughter and the animals used for human consumption people need to see the truth,0
if the gender wage gap had any reasonable meaning companies would increasingly and almost only hire women to lower their wage costs nobody does that therefore closing the gender wage gap is a target entirely based on ideology in particular the premise that men and women are equal in the sense that they should achieve the same income on average this is equal in saying that a construction worker should earn on avg the same income as a stock analyst because they are both humans and therefore equally capable of earning the same the gender wage gap was and still is ideological bullshit,0
this entire video can be summed up by trisha saying shes genderfluid,0
watch mommytang shes a korean vegan w vegan recipes,0
originally  extreme feminists disliked the video without watching it unfortunately the number has increased to over  and is bound to keep increasing,0
ive been a vegetarian for six years an although i feel healthier but theres still lots of fatty food options for vegans and vegetarians its more a lifestyle then a diet but i would recommend shopping at whole foods and trader joes especially because i know they have a lot of options there for me  good luck ,0
because trisha is behaving like an asshole we can finally call her ugly and fat without coming over as assholes,0
i think for you itd just be easier to transition by eating replacements gardein fake meat products are amazing chao cheese is delicious most bread and pita flat breads are vegan scrambled tofu taste really good imo sour patch kids sour cherry blasters are vegan you live in la right there are a lot of vegan restaurants there just do a little google searching over all when you have a craving satisfy it with vegan food eventually you will just want to eat more raw fruits veggies yeah and get used to reading all the labels on the package please do not do the raw food diet its difficult to get enough calories on that diet and when you o into a calorie deficit you will over compensate and binge eat its bad also not eating cooked food sucks ass last thing it seems that all the vegan youtubers responded to this so maybe listen to their advice too,0
this is sad they need to make a transgender girl and boy circuit,1
fucking men whom think theyre women are still men how the fuck is this fair to real girls athletes next thing this creatures will want to be in womens pageants as well,1
i never wear makeup im a man give me my privilege,0
this is vodka btw,0
 k feminist got b triggered by the truth,0
and whilst the feminists are out protesting men are working,0
this is so true feminists need to get over themselves and get to work,0
omg fuck yes finally,0
i am very confused i dont know whats going on,0
i just watched her snapchat from minutes ago she was eating chicken,0
you are only being nice to her because she is your friend,0
its a clear case of cheating if you are born a male you participate in male athletics or like raymeeluna stated transgenders participate against other transgenders end of story i can care less if anyones feelings get hurt,1
im not trans but i had an actual diagnosis of gender identity disorder from a psychiatrist  years ago theres a distinction here i think of myself as a very masculine woman but not trans trans requires that you actually make effort to look like the gender you believe you are i cant bring myself to transition because i know it isnt a cureall to do so i dont even think i could handle the mental changes that come with transitioning having a diagnosis of what is now called gender dysphoria doesnt make me trans,0
this is soooooo wrong take this down,0
q how meat tastes me i dont know,0
so basically what freelee is saying is shes going against everyone who isnt vegan,0
interesting the way gap appears to occurr during child bearing years,0
hype save the planet reconnect with nature more love o,0
aww trish this makes me so happy try to really stick with this change for  weeks eat until youre satisfied if you get cravingsfeel hunger eat more youll be amazed how good youll feel after just onetwo weeks and hopefully youll want to continue  good luck to you youll be so much happier if you change your diet tons happier,0
im newly vegetarian and going to be making my way into being vegan hopefully within a month some video ideas i would find so helpful is maybe doing an eat this not that video where instead of the classic switching out a high calorie meal for a lower calorie do a classic non vegan meal or food item for a vegan mealfood item also maybe do a video on things that are surprisingly not vegan i never know with some foods thank you,0
dont do something if someone else is constantly pressuring you about ur weight freelee,0
if they really dudes fuck yeah its unfair,1
she made two more vids about this shit you should check them out blaire  love you,0
any veggies that are dark colours and nuts are super high in protein,0
if you get a body like freelees those big fake boobies gonna make you fall over,0
youre so beautiful,0
and now please push that into the heads of policy makers and politicians so we may somewhen in the far furute im realistic we start having equal rights on both sexes,0
if only i didnt need youtube red to save this video without a virus,0
love this i have been cutting out meat dairy eggs glutenfree processed food  sugar for  years tried to be vegetarian  vegan a few times i felt better  lost weight but always went back to the old ways due to lack of vegan cooking skills quality products and social pressure turns out i am probably gluten  lactose intolerant i have always been allergic to eggs i am supporting my daughter with dietary changes because she is lactose intolerant had appendix removed because of misdiagnosis  celiac the tides are turning as soon as all the meat is out of my freezer it will be full on vegan,0
if i was that confused id be stuck on my kitchen floor too dead in a pool of urine,0
i never eat meat in my life i was vegetarian now i am vegan,0
vegan almost  years but beyond burger is a big no no for me given me terrible allergy,0
i think i have the most similar opinions with you than a lot of other people and its so satisfying,0
i think trisha embodies a s housewife unfortunately for her and thats the only problem i see here i believe shes confusing gender identity with normal things every person experiences because of this what she says doesnt show me gender confusion it shows me a woman who grew up insecure overcompensated and became overexposed and never learned the concept of acceptance i have pity for her and i think a lot of other people should too,0
ha ha gotta love it  smug pasty  over educated vegan meghans and sustainable sashas existing in an uptight liberal coffee shop bubblepunishing themselves in a guilt ridden semi third world existence  wasnt the arctic ocean supposed to be nothing but a few ice cubes and some floating polar bear carcasses by now ,0
you honestly deserve million subscribers you are such a sweet person and your absolutely perfect ignore the haters your freaking gorgeous and dont let anyone say your not im not vegan but i want to be im vegetarian i love you banana queen ,0
if the gender gap really is a myth then thats great news it means were on the right track for equality but im noticing a distinct lack of sources in the description and it seems to only talk about america i would be far more convinced if i could check for myself where the video gets these statistics from and whether they apply outside the us,0
they sound like dudes and they are dudes look at there arms they have muscle like they lift like men this is horrible,1
  the department of labor paper d im doing a rhetorical analysis of this video and caught that  now i want a cookie,0
teenage boys could beat any professional womans sport team pick a sport  any sportits just the factsbigger stronger faster in every waythis topic is just stupida dude in a dress is still a dude,1
do people care of her reaction why i am vegan  who cares,0
trish as a person who has been a fan for many years i am very disappointed that you wouldnt go like and research before making a video this seems like a very spir of the moment thing honestly if this is how you feel you could be non binary not trans not trying to put you down or anything you dont have to identify as male or female as a non binary person i understand this not feeling like you belong but make sure you do your research before coming out as something you may want to come back from or regret i came out as trans not knowing really what it was thinking oh i feel more like a man than a female what i was actually feeling was me being non binary i go by they them now and it was a long journey and i always regretted coming out because i was super confused i have now come out a year later with a lot more information and am confident with who i am people have chose to make fun of me all the time now love you trisha but please do your research,0
the fuck lmao,1
its wrong period,1
k dislikes from people who cant handle the truth,0
tomorrows video why i couldnt be vegan ,0
wait how would hiring women reduce costs by nearly a quarter that would require employment to be  of the costs and the wage gap to be at  cents to every dollar a man makes yet employment only covers a portion of costs and the wage gap is stated to be at  cents anyone agree or disagree with me on this i agree with the view on the wage gap held in the video but i felt this was a mistake,0
shes probably eating a donut right now lol love you trish,0
pls come to bali ,0
off topic but blaires lips are looking fire i swear she went over the top with lip injections before but now they look so natural and plump,0
this video was filmed around june  is she joking by proclaiming veganism or even vegetarianism yes but i think its based on ignorance a lot of people who become vegetarian or stick with the vegan lifestyle are cutting out meat or animal byproducts because of vicious deaths of living animals cutting out meat andor animal byproducts can also be very good for the human body if youre maintaining a healthy and balanced meal with other nutrients but by becoming veganvegetarian it really begins with educating yourself on how to do so,0
this is really interesting i didnt think about how job flexibility could have a big impact on how much work you can do,0
trish i hve to say that i wasnt a huge fan after the trump video but you won me over with the apology and this vegan video,0
if you go vegan you will be absolutely beautiful i think you are beautiful now but youll be even more so ive been vegan  months it feels great to eat healthy food but my soul feels even better knowing i dont need to kill anything for my plate ive only been watching you for a few monthsjust when you started to go out with sean and ive seen you come so far in such a short time go girl i see you are a beautiful soul ,0
freelee just died,0
men dont take women studies,0
advocating for sbdspace between diet vegan diet for human digestion  hopefully government can be scientifically studying what optimal diet within veganism is  as well for understanding what specific vegan diets animals eat  what materials have the most scientific integrity for all processesall systems specifically my best understanding of what optimal diet for humans is is space between diet sbd certified organic no wheat products no soy products no peanut products no coffee bean products veganplantbasedfoods diet,0
btw those slaughter house videos arent how all of the houses treat them its less then u would think especially and lot of them put them asleep before they do all that shit,0
would they be put in the boxing ring with a woman,0
i would fuck this disgusting mess of a being maybe off myself after but ill deal with that bridge when i come,1
i think i understand what she means im the same way i grew up with boys in a way i was more masculine than the girls in my class i always wanted to be a boy but then i started playing with appearance in my teens but at the same time im attracted to men idk im weird,0
it is unfair and many hormone therapy involves steroids depends on their preference and the doctor,0
im just mad dey black,1
vegans dont put you off the vegans who are popular on youtube put you off but we are not all clickbaiting negative trolls as you put it,0
give your head a shake  norm mcdonald,0
there is no wage gap only zool,0
well women are already expected to do stuff other than just te job men dont have that pressure why  patriarchy so lets teach or society to not be so hard on women and stop being assholes and let them do whatever the hell they want to without imposing stupid conditions ,0
hi kitty yeahhh what is trisha talking about transsexual what trisha just stopno more nonsense thanks,0
something that made me go vegetarian was that you are literally eating a corpse it just grosses me out i wouldnt eat a human corpse so why an animal corpse,0
hmm whats stopping them from not taking hormones before meets they still have an advantage crazy,0
they would get smoked in male competition probably wouldnt make the team,1
ive never seen a video like this that goes into detail and shows how the wage gap is actually real i wonder why that is,0
she is literally the yes im no no im yes we no yes meme ,0
theres a wage gap in the porn industry,0
 was  years ago my guy,0
just after she made a candy bar video,0
no one cares sorry,0
wow great video,0
lets say i own a business i know hiring is an imperfect science and that i will invariably hire employees who arent right for the job the fact that i might be sued for being racist or sexist if i hire a black person or a woman is going to make me only hire white guys not because i am racist or sexist but because those are the only employees who i can easily fire if they arent doing a good job has anyone ever thought how affirmative action and special protections for certain groups ends up helping white guys wouldnt it be better to simply have equal opportunity,0
eat less meat is better than to become vegan,0
tbh i dont think veganism is going to change the world to a better place it feels as though veganism ideology to save animals are artificial,0
it does not e x i s t period,0
whhhaat lol i dont believe this,0
you can kinda eat anything freelee is on a highcarb raw till  diet that basically cuts out any junk food for her until  its not that hard i was vegan for a year and a half im not any more because i just want to try new things since im like only  any way just be careful about high fats and unnatural sugars good luck,0
what people miss is thats retarded and immoral to persue a society were every arbitrary defined group of people earns the same,0
chickfila serves vodka  also great video ,0
trisha is such a moron i cant take her anymore,1
haha i got a cabelas commercial before this,0
every time i see trishas face i see fas  features and every time she speaks it is evident she has the brain  damage it is sad  that is is confused what she is,0
trisha is not the brightest crayon in the box though ,0
i dont think people realise that its tough on women because they want more help with looking after kids and its tough on men who want to spend more time with their kids thanks society ,0
i support lgbtq strongly but it is true that its unfair ,0
now this is some truth right here,0
the truth is that women take on a disproportionate share of childrearing tasks oh you mean like pregnancy and breast feeding two things men physically cannot do this isnt sexism vox its just a natural outcome of the roles that biology has assigned males and females,0
hrshrs not hard to figure out,0
ridiculous of course they do and they should be running in their own category or against men simples,1
if a woman chooses to be a mother it should be her primary role when the earnings gap is viewed in contrast to the lack of mens parental rights it makes sense women earn less because they can force their ex husbands to pay for everything if they want the burden of child rearing shared they should also share parental and reproductive rights,0
im so happy for you trisha,0
basically when you put in all the factors there is an actual gender wage gap but its not as big as the general number that some people use equality is a long continuous battle that has gone on through history and will continue until everyone is totally and completely equal there will always be assholes and sexist out there same for racist but if we can change ourselves we can work to make that number smaller we do not live in a post feminist world just because we have the right to vote does not mean we have equality i think that should be noted and understood that its the general mindset that we need to change,0
youre full of shit,1
this is just all kinds of wrongselfish kids and parents,1
i hope you realize she is a troll here to murder your skeptisism she got readytoglaretoo,0
wtf is wrong with america these are men this shit is slick bullying cause these dudes are picking on every female runner they face,0

that vocal fry is unbearable,0
try the gardenin brand its sooooo good,0
lets all stop bashing trisha for everything i understand that she needs to be held accountable for her actions but in saying that i think this is a huge step and we should all support her in this time of change as opposed to tearing her down,0
thats so disrespectful to track and to females damn this bothers me,1
if you want to lose weight dont eat a lot of fruits fruits  sugar grapes are especially bad for losing weight cuz they contain a lot of sugar eat grapefruits and oranges instead  banana is about  calories  eat only  a day buy nuts and apples and veggies and youll be great  drink a lot of water,0
infertility death and extinction encouraging propaganda,1
first month vegan i will never look back  vegan for life,0
look up vegan recipes on pinterest,0
they do not hire only women for the same reason they pay women less than men sexism and prejudice they think that even with paying less for a female employee it would not be worth it they do not hire as many women to high positions because they think among other things than the underlings will not respect the authority of women or that women do not do as good of a job,0
trisha i am literally crying this just shows how the world is changing that you are even giving veganism a chance im so happy been a fishie for years and years and to see you grow as a person has been great so happy for you and this choice  down the line veganism becomes easier and the food gets better and better as time goes by ,0
garlic green beans are so goooodd just btw,0
these are fckin men with twigs berries and a large amount of testosterone to fuel their bodies for winnings foh,1
she is insane and she wants more attention that is all,0
nobody on the left claims women are paid less than men for the same job except in third world countries and rare instances where equal pay legislation doesnt apply so congratulations on the strawman,0
why should we change the rules for  of the crazies get them some help that ugly ass thing will never pass for female,1

congrats trisha i hope it works out for you girl try to just focus on the benefits of a vegan lifestyle yes the thorough transition between eating meat and animal based foods to zero animal foods will of course be difficult for anyone so dont be put off by how weird your body will begin to feel after a while here are some vegan youtubers how have advice on tasty recipies and vegan lifestyle and other health related things raw alignment all health aspects really the vegan couple preachers rachelleea loads of simple scrumptious vegan inspired recipes that arent expensive and have the vitamins you need alexanders girly talk recipes too and also vegan makeup,0
it blows my mind that people still dont realize shes trolling shes always trolling from the do dogs have brains video to this im trans video and everything in betweenthat said im also so glad so many people dont realize shes trolling because its hilarious shes definitely the most successful longterm troll i look forward to what she does next,0
did you consider sex worker jobs which is totally in favour of women no you didnt women dont pay for sex men do that covers for the gap anyways,0
feminists disliked it k times they cant stand reality,0
did she just hit and kill someone with her car,0
both worked full time full time could mean anything from  to  hours per week,0

try imitation meat you can season it however you want and it is so good for people who are trying to cut out meat ive been vegan for about five months and balancing meals have been that hardest part carb up every morning eat bigger portions of carbs so that you dont get weak from hunger,0
the transcult is eating its own tail over this all identities are valid and stunning and brave and you cannot ever question someones identity lmao,1
i want to show this to my feminist teachers i want to see their faces ,0
im a bit confused so the wage gap exists but is different in different job fields or does it not exist,0
ive been vegan for almost  years i never get sick super healthy full of energy and look  years younger than my real age i am so happy to see the world finally waking up to veganism maybe the planet still has a chance,0
i am  years vegan now still alive,0
so womens get to spend time with there kids and make different decisions whats the problem,0

here comes all the meninists,0
trisha filmed that video like  weeks ago  has eaten so much meat since then im not taking her seriously at all ill believe it when i see it,0
literally the silliest thing i have ever seen on youtube,0
ooooooooooooor your boss might pay you by your skills and efficiency and not what you have under your pants i mean just maybe,0
it is good that a lovely lady is telling this so angry feminists dont get triggered cuz if it was a man well,0
im going to be hung out to dry for saying this but i cant stay quiet any longer ive been vegan since  i hate what has become of the vegan movement i dont like that it has become political im catholic vegan gay and a staunch republican i have to hide under the covers because i get it from all sides what happened to the peace loving vegans of the s,0
keep eating you chemically altered shit food just means more grass fed beef for me ,0
shes a clown ,1
this is one of the only vox videos i dont hate good job,0
shes at it as well,0
when you dont got  brain cells to rub together,1
the fact that we still have to talk about this,0
they arent being excluded from competing as males,0
freelees diet isnt good for the average person so you shouldnt follow her advice in terms of eating as much as you want as long as its vegan shes very active so it works for her i know a lot of people that it hasnt worked for including myself it wouldve worked great for me had i still been an active handball player i would say eat everything youve been used to just make it vegan itll be fun for you to try vegan products and experiment with that since you have the money to try it out,0
trans people should have their own olympics,0
jesus you really explained it very well and justified yourself wheres all the hate coming from,0
 turn on cc youre welcome,0
no offence but i dont think a trans man would have his boobs out  i mean theres nothing wrong with trisha wearing revealing clothing i just she doesnt scream masculine at all to me shes literally one of the most feminine youtubers i can think of non bianary maybe but as girly as she is i think even thats a stretch i do like trisha but i definitely think shes trolling,1
men should of course also take a greater responsibility for families but maybe that is longer down the line ,0
so dishonest and politicized,0
hu mangas lol,0
shes like the annoying version of coppercab,0
i havent heard of trisha in years and suddenly shes all over my feed hmmm coincidence or not,0
there is a noticeable wage gap at the highest levels of income ceos ext but it is not nearly as pronounced as people think,0
i dont know if i would say im confused i would say that im all of it lol what,0
also for the same job at the same company working the same hours woman make exactly the same salary if they made even  less they would sue and they would win it has been illegal for a long time trigger warning do not continue if you are a sjw uncensored logic ahead  ok would you risk losing millions of dollars to save  on a ish paycheck if you were a business owner have you ever ever ever ever seen a paycheck of a woman that is lower than the paycheck of a man if everything but sex is the same it would be on a loop at cnn for  months if they could ever find  just  case of gender pay gap,0
this is vodka btw xd girl i do not blaim you after watching that,0
do raw vegan please high carb low fat dont over do it,0
vegan is vegan lobster mac and cheese even a real thing will you survive,0
so an appeal to our emotions attempting to make us feel sorry for them because they are trans while trying to make the people who feel they have an unfair seem petty,0
yasss trish  whatch hot for food,0
you know why they are payed less cause if we are on a titanic and its sinking women and children get to leave first,0
this is what happens when society is being influenced by paranoid women and nontoxic men,1
i love you,0
feminism exists because of propaganda like this shite video nice try though i guess the tiny dick white guys need a boost up every now and again and of course all the republican woman who dont have any friends or souls need to feel appeased because their own mothers couldnt stand them and because they cant play well with others,0
not gonna lie i cackled when the video started and blaire was sitting on her kitchen floor ,0
get some vegan chocolate protein to make delicious shakes and smoothies,0
please make a video on the whaling that is happening in the faroe islands right now people need to know,0
of course it doesnt exists this claim aims for the retarded feminists,1
isnt wage paid according to the service you give men are paid more in some jobs because they provide more service and customer satisfaction in these jobs so they have to earn more i think that makes sense it also explains why female models are paid more than male models the answer is simple the female models have a higher service satisfaction ratio than their male counterparts so why all the fuss i wonder,0
me and my family me and my husband  our son  almost  year vegan december  best choice we made in a long time,0
please do a video on starting a vegan lifestyle id love some insight tips and opinions,0
this is why we should go back to being the gender we are born with,0
good luck girl i thought you hated veggies,0
in terms of protein nuts quinoa hummus beans lentils etc are all great sources but a quick easy fix is getting a protein powder i used hemp protein and put a scoop on my porridge in the morning hemp protein has a fairly nutty taste so tastes amazing in porridge but i cant really eat it with anything else haha good luck x,0
you want to make more money than men you sick feminists go work on a crane and risk your life  days in a year,0
you should check out unnatural vegan on youtube she has a lot of what i eat in a days and i find them super helpful,0
gardein is a really good brand their seven grain chicken tenders are my shit they taste just like real chicken and you wont notice a difference just be careful when you cook them because they burn easily a lot of restaurants use them to make their veggie burgers i would also recommend just searching vegan recipes peta has a good list of vegan substitutes on their website too,0
wait so the fact that women can have kids makes them less deserving of an equal wage,0
vegan mukbang d,0
im not quite sure if is good the production and market of vegan products in big restaurants i think that one of the biggest problems to our enviroment is the comsumption so how can help buying a vegan hamburguer or pizza in those places espero me haya explicado bien,0
i have never clicked so fast on a video while laughing to death before,0
notice their arguments when the interviewer asks them to play devils advocate at  both of them basically said i would be happy for them because they get to be who they are and do what they want its the epitome of selfishness they didnt attempt to argue from a biological perspective or even mention womens sports its all about them not about other girls people talk about inclusion at the expense of all biological women who want to compete,0
my last job i worked  years towards becoming supervisor only to have a horrible women who was bff with a head board member became my supervisor in  months so i am not buying into the wage gap it is fake,0
they can do whatever the hellllll they want with their bodies but once they try to change the system and force their thinking then thats when im triggered,1
thank you cristina,0
holy sht a first by one of these youtube channels to expose it,0
you come for my meat ill take your life meat saved me i was dying from veganism it is a death cult,1
their isnt one,0
a month ago i was a sexist pig for saying that the wage gap has nothing to do with equal pay for the same work marginal progress,0
if this in not propaganda what is,0
can you please have a warning in ur videos like if theres a video clip of the slaughter house and  what time because it always makes me want to throw up what they do to the animals makes me so upset  thank u,0

roast chickpeas in a wok plan and make rice its so good and its super easy and full of protein i ate it a lot in the start of me being vegan,0
bout to get cancelled lmao,0
if women are paid less then men then why dont business hire them,0
people on the left pushing the wage gap are trying to make the point that if a man and a woman are working the same job that due to sexism companies and corporations will pay the women  less than men correct i have  points a who are the companies doing this where are the whistleblowers how could any company get away with a policy like this in  and keep everyone silent men and women b for every job you found where men and women were making the same money in the same position for hours worked etc you would have to find another where the woman was making  less than the man in the same position for hours worked to get  right,0
it takes courage to give up things you been brought up on like to say well done to you all the souls who took first step of courage to give up eating wrong type of food like meat also give up dairy like cheese milk ectgod will be very happy with souls who dont harm other beings tooyou souls will lot closer to god give up alcoholsmoking too this is also harmful for the self and harms organs dont harm others being and dont harm the self has well lots blessings to you all souls i was raised as a vegetarian as a child was married into non vegetarian family i did go through that part of life eating meat my health was terrible in those years when i went back to vegetarian my health started to improve for me it easier to give up meat because i wasnt raised eating meatit was little harder to give up dairy milk and cheese slowly i gave it too,0
its a mental illness ,1
 theyre gonna die in  years lmao even omnivores know that,1
i like how feminist portray the freedom of choice but do not actually look into the meaning of choice why focus on something that hasnt been researched properly and bark with claims plus men have a psychological burden of having a job however women do not have that burden,1
get the app happy cow itll tell you all the vegan restaurants near you and i know you love eating out im sure la has some amazing vegan places ,0

trisha every time shane  jeffree make a successful series you have to try to make a video like this stop we see it,0
this video is a godsend this should be a requirement in all schools to watch,0
sorry folks this is as much bs as the game changers movie was funded by corporate interests all the recent clinical peer reviewed credible scientific evidence supports a ketogenic style diet for optimal health and longevity do your research and the climate change argument please and animals why are the lives of cattle or chickens valued more than field mice birds and even insects etc that are killed by the millions in the pursuit of growing plants for consumption that are very low in nutrition density do your research this is an advert for beyond meat nothing more,0
ummm enuff dudes not even fair let me help make this rite u guys can look like girls but run against the fellas,1
you can eat as much as you want as long as you cycle as much as her and durianrider they work out a lot and do uphill cycling thats how they can eat literally  calories a day if they wanted,0
this is awesome its ground breakinggood for you girllll,0
lol clicked this video so fast  there are loads of vegan restaurants in la also starbucks offers coconut milk as a non dairy alternative and to see physical results it will take more than a couple weeks  exercise freelee doesnt just wake up with abs lol but its an amazing life style great for your body and the earth best of luck,0
its unfair smh,1
why are people doubting her if she is really passionate about going vegan than she can do it trish you can go vegan just stick to it and carry on love you trish you can do it,0
if you are having cravings a vegan burrito bowl is always the way to go,0
there is no wage gap shocker,0
dont be afraid of carbs because carbs are good,0
 and  are not most peoples wages i dont think that statistic is very relivent,0
good work girls x,0
unfair and wrong they went through puberty as a boy bone density and size is different should be no further discussion,0
go trish im so proud of you girl you should try cliff bars lara bars and square bars they taste like candy bars and are amazing,0
bruh there is no wage gap the only  gap  there is is the iq gap between normal people and feminists because they cant even do math right,0
k dislikes are from libtards,0
youre a fat trump supporting ugly cuck loving skank,1
so happy for you trish do not go for the high carb low fat bullshit you wont be able to sustain it you should eat healthy and drink lots of water keep it simple keep it vegan you got this ,0
well she didnt last long at all lol just on her snapchat she was eating chicken and waffles great job trish unfollowing,0
should have stuck to eating food videos  this is it for me,0
its whole food plant based period nothing else will save either your health nor the environment and dignity of the planet i have never experienced such longterm positive change in myself before and i instantly feel change for the worse when i start introducing sweets and bisquits and lots of bread and spreads xmas time as for the latter turning the anglophone public around is probably the only way to tackle this  so we obviously have to go for fake meat etc anyway i started my plant based transition in december  and it was triggered first of all by vegangains in whose sources i instantly found dr greger which led me to neal barnard dr klaper and the rest of the cool gang despite having seen various slaughterhouse documentaries most meanwhile unavaillable in yt in  years what the health and hope being baby shit in comparison to some it took the health argument to empower me of permanently eating plant based contrary to all my friends and family contrary to my physicians advice only one of my friends switched over to our side but fell back a couple of months later meanwhile i find that here and there i find people who at least sympathise with the plant based idea most educated women say i would if i couldif my husband would join men say things like dont touch these potatoe peels  they are for my rabbits some however pay credit for my consistency admitting they would like to be able to hop on the train also the climate argument came only later in ,0
actually men make  with a  cent tax and women make ,0
to boil down this huge ass rant that is pretty damn foot in mouth gender fluid is what you are looking for not transgender g e n d e r f l u i d cutting your hair short and liking it isnt just for guys its girls aswell its hair you like not being hit on creepily yeah duh doesnt mean you gotta be a dude to feel like that dont dress up hair and make up still possible for women you arent a drag queen when you glam up you are just a woman glaming up if you wanna dress masculine you can still do that and be female from what youve said all im hear is i want to look and dress the way i want without weird shit happening you arent trans for feeling like that thats how everyone feels no matter where you sit on the gender spectrum i really wish you took a bit more time before rushing in and saying all this incorrect and hurtful things,0
you cant eat  calories of plant based foods and expect to lose weight or not gain weight look up people who have gained weight when they switched to a high carb vegan diet also you are not going vegan for  weeks if its for aesthetic reasons the correct term is plant based good luck,0
crap now im hungry,0
i swear that watching this entire praegeru series on youtube has given me a superior and more practical education than  years of college did factor in the subtle indoctrination i no doubt received obtaining a liberal arts degree and all i needed to unlearn in the real world id say these little videos are invaluable,0
gender studies is antimale propaganda,0
for my th birthday i went vegan  so far so good the food i cook is delish i love finding new vegan foods,0
im early af lol,0
yall dumb and ignorant with these comments didnt u hear that there on hrt i understand the advantage in the beginning but once on hrt for  months they have the same estrogen levels and testosterone levels as a cisgenderd woman biological woman in fact there probebly at a cardiovascular disadvantage due to the advirse affects of hrt has on the body,0
okay so i dont know who the clown at  is but he is just embarrassing,0
please dont be clickbait please dont be clickbait,0
simply put this dudes are messing it up for chicks the only solution here is another trans division of sports which no one will attend,1
sjw and feminist   starts screeching horrifically,0
great film nfi protocol has seafood  egg recipes mins check pinterest  is someone misleading us seeding fake news online,0
so in short the wage gap is produced not by discrimination but by the choices that women make,0
she could be gender fluid or non binary,0
why is everyone being rude even if she wanted to cut out soda or just dairy yall should support her,0
how are you going to do trane candy hauls,0
is it too harsh to say she looks like a failed mtf trans  trish not blaire,0
if your born a female but look like a boy you are a female unless you actually get trans,0
for goodness sake all this talk about gender and whatnot there are masculine females and feminine males that does not mean that they are a different gender your gender is what you were born with period idc if anyone else says they identify as this or that your sexuality is a different story but im sorry genders are not changeable i am a female and i am way more masculine than most boys that i know and i have always felt boyish since i was young but nonetheless i know that i am a female people are making everything such a big deal and confusing everything,1
is there a new music video coming out or something,0
do i identify as a transgender man  do i identify as my natural born gender  how the in the name is sweet baby jesus does this make any sense these two sentences are they dumbest words ive ever heard come out of a humans mouth  ive heard a lot of dumb things,1
are you fucking stupid,1
i love you a lot,0
my teacher is trying to force us students that there is a wage gap and im afraid to send him this video,0
can u make a video laying it all out of what u can eat in this lifestyle pleasei get so confused,0
if women made less than men employers would only hire women,0
omg im soooooooo proud,0
christina hoff summers is spot on with this one,0
as a vegan i genuinely hate the scare mongering bs that is being put out people should go vegan because needless killing and torture is wrong but telling people the world is going to end in  just makes us all look bad,0
amaze love you guys thank you for spreading the love,0
jesus these comments are a mess the video is implying that the primary solution lies in incentivizing businesses to give more flexible working hours which is something that can narrow the earnings gap and potentially be better for everyone you dont have to be a diehard feminist to see the logic here in the standard household where women work but also take on a bit more responsibility for childcare the option of say a  shift for mothers means that they can better align their working schedule with childcare it also gives more flexibility to work ot,0
there is too much truth and logic in this video that it offends me and i need to march,0
trisha girl you need to go topostmate doomies home cookin and veggie grill both are in hollywood so it should be convenient for you hell there are three veggie grills in hollywood which in my opinion have some of the best vegan food and wont make you miss meat and dairy i know it helped me stay vegan because i could still eat the foods i love like burgers tacos pasta etc i hope you try these places and succeed with your diet,0
how many innocent oxygenproducing plants were murdered in the making of this video,0
only  seconds in and damn,0
ive been vegan for a few months and you should get almondsoy milk bean burgers smart dogs meatless meat you should make your own veggie pizza with chopped bell peppers pizza sauce baby spinach i know you can also find vegan cheese i live in the south so it isnt common here and plenty more it makes you feel sooo good just physically and i still have my junk sometimes like vegan ice cream lol,0
dairy meat and and big pharma follow the money chaching,0
to be honest this was boring asf,0
trisha honey you need some professional help immediately please,0
i absolutely agree with everything said in this video trish please you aint trans sam smith you are a man etc etc etc i swear all my friends think im just being whateverthehell phobic no im being rational sweetie,0
some of your more recent publicity stunts have been so stupid that theyre funny but this is just fucked youre making a whole community look bad just so you can rake in some more cash from all the drama that itll cause fuck you,1
go girl stay vegan for life though,0
men earn more and can work longer hours at higher paying jobs because women are traditionally tasked with taking care of children maybe thats where we need to work on equality in the home,0
id recommend any gardein products i loveee the crispy tenders and the orange chicken is delicious and its all vegan its especially good for vegans that are used to meat products,0
love this video but also dont agree that sam smith and jonathan van ness coming out as non binary was for attentionclicks being non binary is not a fad and super didnt appreciate it coming off that way for non binary folks that may be watching this,0
what do they miss about the wage gap it doesnt exist,0
david attenborough once said that veganism is nonsense and that humans are like lions forreal,0
our factors for wage gap in full time work is how many hours worked and occupation choices isnt full time work defined by  hours in most cases and its not peculiar that mens occupations offer more pay i guess all those lawsuits between women and companies over the women getting paid less were just leftist jokes lol hilarious,0
yes there is,0
that is just fruit you need profitenlike nuits and more veggies like spinise brokoli,0
this is sad but it is true im  and i use to run track in high school too i was second best on my team i know how it feels to be a woman athlete and im bisexual so im all for the lgbt community but ill be damned if a trans woman come and take over and me becoming rd best on the team because shes a man that shit aint right im sorry but its not im all for equality but its not right for us natural women our bodies are physically different from theres weather they use hormons or not we cant beat a trans woman cause they are technically men thats crazy to me i understand both sides of this story but at the end of the day it is fucked up how now a days women got to go through this it isnt fair this equality act is giving inequality real talk,1

male stripers dont get paid as much as female stripers,0
how do you upload an apology and keep the video youre apologizing for up,0
good luck trish i know you can do it ,0
there is no gap per hour worked as most people are lead to believe this video was sort of half admitting this but never was it mentioned that same job per hour worked is going to be the same amount of pay in aus industries have to abide by ebas or enterprise business agreement which means who ever you are you get a set amount per hour this however does not apply to small businesses like a local fish and chips shop or something,0
freelee is kinda the reason i stopped eating meat i wasnt really interested or thought about it much until i started seeing all the vegan channels that are starting and everyone was always talking about how freelee is a bitch in the comments of other videos i watched so of course i had to see how much of a bitch she was and stuff she said just kinda made sense you know im not fully vegan but im going to be living on my own soon and buying my own groceries so i plan to make that transition then,0
no none of it makes sense youre an idiot stop trolling youre a disgrace ,1
yay i hope she stays on this path,0
this shit aint right,1
dont call me a bitch bitch,0
i do not care what the job huge salaries need raining in there are not enough hours in a day for any human being to genuinely earn hundreds of thousands of pounds in a salary its just greed to make them richer that the rest who are probably working ten times harder for a very very lot less,0
watches while eating chicken nuggets,0
shes the same dumbass who tried vegan snacks with shan dawson and literally could not even swallow one of them i have an awful feeling shes far too stupid to put up with the vegan lifestyle unfortunately,1
w let me fry some eggs n steak for this,0
i thought about this for a min in particular the first question especially bc this logic would then apply to other wagegaps whether it ethnicity disabilities age and even something as small as employee physical appearance tall attractive people are statistically paid more so why not hire only short ugly people the reason is people inherently believe that the short ugly female etc person is worse at their jobs and deserves less pay or much more often they believe that the tall attractive white male will do a better job and therefore deserves more basically favouritism so to put it another way the first question implies that the hiring manager knows that a man and woman will perform the same task to the same ability but in reality prejudices impact how they perceive someone completing a task so the hiring manager will believe a white man will and does perform the job better and deserve more compensation,0
what the fuck is this,0
dont just eat little portions of fruit  carbs are the main thing  eat loads,0
did that creature had some horrible accident with vacuum cleaner stuck on her lips also you cant go more than to   the   literally means all  you cant have more than all,0
actually watched the whole add thanks for your work,0
now when it suits people looking at you feminists men and women are no longer equal this is what feminists and the likes fought for so they should stfu and take the consequences if a man identifies as a woman she should be allowed to go shatter every record without discrimination period you whined about it now you have it,0
am i gay  am i attracted to the opposite gender ,0
there is no wage gapthere are only fat lazy femenists who think they are the center of the world,1
lies lies lies,0
i think that firstly there is a huge mix up between the unequal pay for the same job wich is illegal and the gender wage gap the actual ctsdollar wich is a real problem that being said yes it can be explained with the job differences of course there is an explication but the problem is that womens dont actually chose not to be an ingeneer or a computer scientist they are more or less unconsciously banned from those kind of jobs because historicaly these are men jobs and thats exactly what is unfair and what we have to fight against because a women isnt less legitimate to be an ingeneer and neither naturally more skilled to be a nurse btw imo this channel is dangerous because they always avoid the real debate instead they focuse on prooving smthing else which is easier and then claim to have solved the debate,0
gotta love how pathological liars get all the attention these days zoe quinn trisha paytas whos next,0
you should eat beans i love vegan burritos,0
i loved the talk with jordan peterson saying that women are much more sensible than men for not pursuing more career advancement once youre not living in destitution the extra money you have does little or nothing to improve your happiness,0
omg god that videos is weird ,0
i wouldnt say its not fair yeah you won because of that surprise,0
its exactly as she says about how being able to define the gender wage gap is hard to summerise when there are so many contributing factors to these causes of a wage gap other studies show evidence of the gap because of the areas they research the cause of the gap while other studies conclude that there is no gap because of where they focus their research and evidence on its very hard to come to a decision or view point when there are so many contradicting factors to consider,0
i have a big giveaway on my channel go check it out,0
sec  states that any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of section  section  of this title shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than  or to imprisonment for not more than six months or both no person shall be imprisoned under this subsection except for an offense committed after the conviction of such person for a prior offense under this subsection this makes it illegal to pay women less than men based simply off of their gender therefore it makes the entire wage gap idea simply wrong due to this section that came straight out of the equal pay act that was approved by congress in the year of  on june th while the average man is more likely to take more dangerous jobs that offer more money while women are more likely to take less paying jobs such as psychology early education social work human services etc now take note that the wage gap is the average earnings of men and women working fulltime and it doesnt account for different job positions hours worked different jobs or even the same job it just accounts for the overall gain because of this it looks as women are payed less when placing the overall profit of men compared to women because the more dangerous jobs pay more while the ones women are more likely to take areobviously not but hypothetically speaking lets say that women are paid less on average it is said that women make  cents compared to every dollar a man makes which if you do the math can average down to  dollars lost in an average womans lifetime or  dollars each year if this were true then employers would only hire women so they could save  dollars every year that could go to something else would they not business owners arent stupid and they would certainly do almost anything it takes to have extra money in the bank so why arent they simple the wage gap is a myth created by feminists to bolster their sad excuse for a movement,1
im for equal pay men get way less than women in the porn industry ,0
this is random but your teeth look really nice,0
why are you surpressing your voice at the end of almost every sentence its kind of annoying,0
autismgender wyomingender wolfgender lgbt youtubers have no problem trishgender apologize nowah ,0
this girl has lost her mind holy shit,1
lol what a bunch of crap,0
is anyone else sooo confused on what she is talking about and thinks shes fucking crazy,1
if i had a dollar for every gender id have ,0
yesss trish im so proud of you drink smoothies rice pasta potatoes eat a lot of starches to fill you up  im so proud also look for vegan resturants,0
this video makes a lot of sense to me however how do you respond to a feminists counter that women are conditioned and socially gendered ie oppressed to choose the less highpaying careers eg girls growing up play house growing up taking care of dolls and etc  nurturing jobs or motherhood in other words a feminist would say that women do not have free choice because of societys conditioning how do you disprove that,0
eat lots of potatoes and rice and beans,0
ive been watching trish for like a longass time im just really really concerned about her mental health like i was already concerned and now im doubly concerned to me thats all thats really going on here someone needs to intervene and get her some serious help and she needs to stop hanging around enabling people who just go along with whatever she says or does realass people tell you when you need to shut up and tell you when youre full of shit nicely but firmly i dont think she has that person and shes left with her mind and for someone whos really mentally ill and untreated being left with your mind is a terrible terrible scenario i really hope she gets help and that big youtubers dont condone this by automatically agreeing with her statements to get some kind of clout for being a transally or whatever honesty people,0
thank i god,0
thats awesome but you should work out a lot too for tone they also cut the chickens beaks off with electric cutters im glad you are not eating animals,0
 sounds like national geographic show guy,0
ever hear of that man who devorced his wife because she can not support him financially,0
i always tell people the wage gap isnt that simple its there but that most famous number is so misleading and vague as you guys say,0
lol good luck,0
i am a feminist and agree with this video we are not all insane,0
youre awesome i never comb my hair on weekends i almost never wear makeup i love girly stuff but sometimes feel tomboyish but this does not make me trans right ,0
congratulationsall of you gave her free promo and attention,0
so we need to figure out a way to plan jobs so that women have more time for themselves,0
racism sexism transphobia we need democratic socialism to solve this,0
eating baby potatoes and veggies while watching this and feeling super pleased with all the progress veganism is making,0
shut down wage gap discussions by pressing them on the far more outrages death gap in the workplace until they shush about the wage gap all they should hear from us is death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap death gap,0
what happened to freelee so instagram,0
thank you for pointing out that even if shes trolling shes actually speaking and acting the way many many people do earnestly i cant remember that little creature that was riley denniss friend but she popped to mind so many girls act like this and as someone who used to read a lot of yaoi comics online a lot of the female creators transitioned simply because they fetishized gay guys its actually a thing that happens but some of them end up doing the whole testosterone thing which is really unhealthy and then detransition huge waste of time and resources also thank you for not claiming to actually be a real girl other trans people i watched try to claim this that they were real men despite being born women and trisha was not like honey why did you have to transition then i love you and your channel because you dont deny the reality of your birth and existence and i think that makes you happier in your own way than other trans people who cannot accept the reality of their situations,0
freelee is going to die,0
wow this was done by vox i cant believe they didnt ride the same there is a wage gap its because of oppression line that has been projected for decades,0
yes so proud ,0
i want to show this to my mother and all feminists but theyll just say thats not true or something like that,0
soooooo proud of you i went vegan  months ago and i have lost  pounds without trying  yes girl its all true that you can eat all you want on a vegan diet lifestyle and lose weight so i can promise you this will be life changing and all for the better i actually had severe fibromyalgia and i used to live with constant pain to my surprise going vegan healed all of my pain symptoms there are lots of great vegan products out there so you wont feel your missing anything go to the loving hut restaurant and try their noble burger vegan hamburger also there are mock chicken nuggets sandwiches etc and they are the bomb just follow freelees advice tricia and get ready to be blown away by how great your going to feel and watch the weight just fall off  just going to say this now that not everyone will be happy for you when you lose your weight that you want to lose  its because they are jealous so recognize it and dont worry youll have your true friends and fans that will be happy for you and encouraging always you can do this much love  ,0
its just common sense oof gut punch to dem feminist,0
i thought trisha paytas gender was psychotic shrek,1
childrearing whod have thunk it seriously you need a study for this more seriously this seems to be just another instantiation of how men an women are and behave differently meaning if we collect all factors contributing to the so called wage gap we likely find out the playing field was level all along the players just moved differently on it,0
because of the amount of money they earn they literally assume its because theyre a woman,0
i hate vegans,0
is there a wage rape tho ,1
you got to look up all the things youll be able to eat as a vegan so you dont get so bored with it that you end up just not wanting to do it for example so youre still able to have like your frappe if youre willing to make them yourself or ask for a substitute at stores you can have almond milk and other nut milk,0
im so proud omg im vegan and i hope you love the lifestyle ,0
the lesson is stop making men do chores they suck at it in everyway and any woman is x more motivated to do them ask our ancestors,0
i just wish feminists could see this video,0
problem with transgender and sexuality acceptance is people label themselves too quickly ive been out as bisexual to most since i was  when it wasnt a popular thing as im only  i thought it overtime and felt completely ready people assume just because sometimes being a women sucks it means youre a guy nah bro nah,0
i feel so fcking offended,0
yay eat lots of carbs potatoes rice pasta check out stellathelight on youtube and instagram she changed my life and does meal plans and is an amazing support system google lots about hclfv high carb low fat vegan im so happy for you,0
freelee bring back the dont forget to go fruit yourself outros,0
trisha paytas might be delusional she just need therapy like she sound all over the place nd ppl who dont know themselves will believe the shit sh is saying,0
ladies are now wasting their time participating in any sport some wimpy woman is going to outdo you and all your hard work will be worthless,1
i am trying to go vegan i have never been a big fan of meat so thats not the issue its difficult to go vegan living with someone who isnt willing to do it with you i dont want to cook a nice vegan meal for me and then turn around and cook him a steak any suggestions,0
get em chris,0
i still wanna see a womans pay stub that reads  below the minimum wage feminists,0
grapes are going to bloat you up so are melons and other high water dense fruits because youve been eating crap for so long your guts will not be used to it and you will feel uncomfortable i would recommend trying to eat more cooked vegan foods like rice beans pasta corn potatoes oatmeal and veggies with stuff like sweet chilli sauce etc if your gonna be vegan you need to start trying to eat veggies again you will start to like them after a while you have been hooked on the crack cocaine of food so dont be supprised when normal food tastes bland and boring,0
wow you disproved this strawman that totally hadnt been destroyed earlier by anyone else why do women have worse occupations positions education and work less hours gender roles,0
unbefuckingleavable delusional people men cant compete with women whether or not they are trans or not,1
thoroughly enjoyed informative and empowering as ever going vegan is our future,0
piers morgan is such a douche,1
what about boxing you gonna put floyd in a blonde wig against a woman ,1
being vegan is not healthy,0
the feminists choose to ignore the things that are right,0
thank god there are still people with common sense these days,0
plus it should not be called wage gap but earnings gap or something,0
who in california isnt vegan nowadays lol i live in chicago and i wanna go vegan but theres not really a vegan scene here,0
love watching shit like this twist sjws into a twist,0
very well done video bvery informative very impressive,0
thanks for making a fairly unbiased factual video it was leaning a bit left but you made a lot of good points and explained the differences in women and men in the workforce  for using your platform to educate,0
no one should be taking trisha seriously seriously,0
help me i lost a bunch of brain cells listening to trisha now i cant remember my name or where i live,0
oh god it hurts my brain i cant watch this shit anymore,0
more steaks for me i love burning gas in my monster truck,0
censored reality is how people are kept in ignorance individuals become vegan because they are exposed to the truth and by seeing uncensored reality paul mccartney said it all those years ago if slaughterhouses had glass walls it is sad to see plant based news filter out reality by blurring the horrible truth of carnivores eating animals let the truth speak for itself  lets make those brick walls into transparent glass,0
ive been vegan for over three years and vegetarian for over  years before that it has changed my life for the better in all ways thank you for this amazing video my soul hurts so much for our animals and our planet this gives me hope,0
well its vox ladies and gentlemen  why would i expected  trash journalism at it finest,0
literally sounds like she is nonbinary with a gay man fetish but didnt do any research into her own sexuality and decided she was tans and called it a day,0
im surprised vox would put out a video without a political agendawhat is this sorcery,0
im not like other girls im a gay man,0
this video is pretty accurate there is no gender pay wage gap in the workplace but that does not discount that it still exists due to societal sexism men and women may make the same amount in the same job but they are told from a younger age that those lower paying jobs are more likely to be a fit for them we are told to be teachers social workers and therapists while a man is often told he should be a doctor lawyer or scientist its not on the workplace besides that  cents which is still not good but forgivable but rather on raising our girls to believe that they can do whatever they want to do,0
its trisha paytas shes tolling,0
i feel like the girls without testosterone should at least get a head start even if its  second,0
wtf but biologically they are still men so they should complete against men they cant run in the olympic omg why even consider this,1
they have an obvious unfair advantagecall it cheating because they are men,0
if you like green tea starbucks green tea frappaccino without whipped cream is vegan and delicious,0
can we get more transgender genetic females competing against men i want an easy win  oh wait that doesnt happen much,0
she was eating chicken on her snapchat story today i had such high hopes  im so disappointed dont get me wrong i love trisha but i was kinda hoping shed actually at least do the whole  weeks,0
i was watching this and got sooooooo confused,0
im a lacto vegetarian and i dont miss meat at all proud trisha eat carbs such as egg plant mushrooms potatoes and stay away from sweets gelatins and gummies you can do it stay determined,0
ive been vegan for almost  years now and i will never go back i recommend to buy almond milk oatmeal and rice those are my favorite,0
so youre saying women should become lion tamers,0
feminists say women get paid less while still hiring men because the patriarchial good boy club twisting their curling mustaches smoking their cigars and wearing top hats shined with female tears conspire to make sure women die on the job  of the time pay alimony  of the time get a  sentencing discount and get custody  of the time oh wait,0
im hella excited go trish,0
if god doesnt destroy america he is going to have to apologize to sodom and gommorah one day this sexual perversion and debauchery is getting out of hand,1
you forget to say that its the choice of the woman not to go to those late meetings or to stay late for work you also didnt mention that men are far more likely to ask for a raise wouldnt that mean that men would get raises more than women also if the wage gap were a real thing wouldnt all business owners only hire women so they could pay them less and save money the wage gap comes down to the choices of workers this really shouldnt be a hot topic in the us,0
so happy for you were all in this together highschool musical voice,0
he is saying its need to be fair that she is in a place where she belongs yes guess what in the male competition,1
where can i find a woman like this but like  years younger,0
what a disgusting human being,1
 literally what i always say,0
so your admitting this is mostly based on choices not discrimination now if i wanted to look at this through the lense of victimhood i could say that men are forced by society to work rigid hours to provide for a family even though they may not want too,0
freelee has the warmest smile ever,0
this converted me,0
i love this video try oatmeal full of proteins,0
theres vegan options in almost every restaurant,0
women and men are different both have different duties to each their own men go to work whereas women stay at home and take care of the children stay single or have no child if you want the same wage as men id be the richest just by hiring lowwage middle age women for my business,0
you can tell that shes doing this for attention views down she loves the drama the lies and lengths shell go to for attention is incredible,0
im sure someone will try to discredit this video likely a feminist who will have no actual proof that it isnt true but most feminists dont care about trivial things like facts,0
i dont feel sorry for these actresses in hollywood where they make millions,0
this shit is not fair this remind me of the jawanna mann movie men are born with more muscles and less fatty tissue its unfair the the real girls who have trained they whole life against the obstacles our body presents on its own im so tired of trans women telling real women what a woman is unless you have experienced cramps from a heavy period or had to deal with boobs especially for an athlete bc bigger boobs can be a hindrance in sports you are not a woman you are a trans woman which is a different category i think i feel like im a doctor today so why dont i go operate in some ppl might feel like a policeman later on and arrest somebody im all for ppl living the best life they want to live but when it starts to affect someone else future thats where i draw the line if one of my children was running with these girls i would bring pickett signs to every meet,1
veganic  permaculture  deserves its recognition for sure,0
she already fucked it up ,0
its illegal to pay people differently for the same work if there is a wage difference how come there isnt lots of legal action being taken perhaps they wouldnt stand up in court,0
its so amazing that you are going vegan but note that all the fruit that you are eating does still have tons of sugar in it it is amazing for you and way better than candy but if you dont work it off it will store as fat so along with this diet that freelee has she also must work out and go on walks and bike rides to keep it off remember that you can have everything you loved before as a vegan you can still eat waffles that are vegan my fave and almond milk lattes are bomb side not  oreos are vegan so if you really need something processed go ahead and eat them oreos haha just know that there is literally a vegan version of everything almond milk soy milk coconut milk vegan eggs vegan meat vegan waffles vegan burgers and vegan sandwiches yesssss so you can still have amazing goodies as being a vegan remember to get vegetables,0
you go girl  the animals will thank you for this descision soooooooo much,0
i love positive videos like this from you freelee ,0
if its not fair for scalet johanssen then this is even less fair,1
im sorry to pop ur bubble but i follow trish on snapchat and just today i saw her eating animal products,0
the scary part is the k drag queens in the school system,0
 completely off topic but im gunna be studying aerospace engineering at ut already got accepted next couple years and i knew i was in for a sausage fest but god damn man,0
with this logic were basically all fuckin transgender this is just stupid the more n more she talks i think she really really truly does want b jeffree star just stop we see u,0
not to be transphobic but like i would die for angela,0
people read into statistics to much me and my wife worked full time i made  more then her she worked  hours a week i worked  now the kids are grown and our income reversed she makes  more then me we both work  hours a week very typical of american familieswhy does everyone devalue women that make the decision to raise children into successful human being materialism is killing america and the rest of the world,0
liberals want equality yet all dudes will be dominating every sports record in  years a perfect example of how warped theyre thinking is,0
omgggg trish im so proud of you baby steps are great too  maybe you can try to eat some cooked food too for me at least when i started out first i thought eating cooked food was way easier and maybe you can eat what you always ate but do them the vegan version for example if you like pasta continue eating them just make it the vegan way by substituting the sauce for vegan ones etc im so excited for you to see the results and feel sooo much better  all the best,0
thank god someone made this video can we finally bury this wage gap myth bs now,0
now this is what i call compulsive bullshitting,0
me and my bf eat meat and whatnot but we buy locally ,0
the wage gap doesnt exist dumbass,0
trish look up mommytang shes amazing shes here on youtube,0
two mentally ill boys posing as girls liberals are dangerous,1
please stick to it trish it is so important i have been vegan for a few months and it has made me so much happier whenever you struggle just remember this  happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony if you have even a small amount of compassion for animals which clearly you do this lifestyle will make you appreciate all other species so much more and appreciate life in general just try to listen to your body if you arent hungry then dont eat if you are hungry then eat even if you just ate a meal dont expect to lose a ton of weight initially your body like mine has a lot of metabolic damage caused from restriction and starvation that will take a little while to reverse be patient with the lifestyle and most importantly remember that it is a lifestyle and not a diet ,0
the wage gap is babies having babies causes the gap if you dont want a wage gap marry a man in a career who makes much less than you and will be willing to be a stay at home dad,0
female porn stars are considered oppressed because the patriarchy forces them to debase themselves nonwhitenoneast asian male porn actors are oppressed too because theyre being exploited for their exotic features according to a feminist youtuber i watched once laci green i believe,0
imagine vox thinking it has an opinion,0
thats very transphobic of you,0
i omg i dont know how i got here but thank you,0
queen of being trans ,0
i mean you could be gender fluid maybe idek with you anymore look into it,0
if you dont feel like a female why did you have your boobs done why do you post these sexual pictures about yourself in lingerie why do you just look and act like a  female trisha this doesnt make sense girl wtf,0
i made the decision to go veganplant based in  its sad how much social media and doctors can brain wash us as a fitness influencer you see videos of people eating salad or fruit and being told this is stunting your progress even popular diets take out fruits and high carb veggies so sad,0
how can having hair on your lip mean you as a kid look like a man a female child cant look like a manboymaybemanno,0
the wage gap is a difference in hours worked on same jobs if a man works  jours while a women works the standard  then the man is paid more,0
fuck you trisha exploiting trans people for views is so fucking low you dont know shit about what we go through on a daily basis this video is really hurtful and cruel for anyone to even think about making this shit makes me sick fucking fuck you  i never leave comments but this time i couldnt stop myself,1
trisha you have to see this ive been on and off veganplant based for  years now and ive discovered if you go hard its fun for a while but you crave treats i can give you recipes for my vegan pumpkin chocolate chip muffins chocolate chip zucchini loaf pancakes brownies etc but get the app vegan amino people post meals to give you inspiration its not all just raw healthy its just vegan which is where you should start i promise you it will help second izzie davis a vegan upriver who is friends with free leeds recently mentioned how feeler promotes this eat thousands of calories diet but doesnt in force the necessary exercise that diet is for athletes take up spin and eat healthy but dont overdo the calories because you can still gain weight so yeah eat things youre used to eating make sure you get protein the more muscle you have the more calories you burn daily and dont go rear until you have the basics down love you sorry for my spelling and autovorrect in advance lol,0
who asked for your response,0
im satisfied with the likedislike ratio,0
why is she so dumb,0
see i have trouble with this video it does present facts but is very biased how does pay and bonuses compare between men and women in executive roles how does pay compare between men and women managers and supervisors how does pay compare between men and women in technical fields engineering programming etc really i could probably make a video espousing the benefits of tobacco smoking how it helps focus the mind increases productivity reduces stress in stressful situations is a mild appetite suppressant so can help with weight loss without leading to an eating disorder doesnt cause mental instability like hard drugs do afterwards you might be totally convinced that smoking is amazing at the same time the video would be misleading because it doesnt present the risks of smoking so yeah men and women working in low level jobs are going to be paid the same or are they men tend to gravitate to higher earning jobs and women tend to gravitate to caring jobs but i need to see like for like comparisons in a sample of specific fields before i would be convinced making a video like this is just fluff for sexists and misleading for others,0
i hate liberals,1
this is amazing trish definitely get in the cooked foods beans rice potatoes dont be scared of eating too much you need to eat more whilst transitioning im in la and would happily help you out with anything you need eating out grocery shopping anything,0
could i get the sources for these studies,0
dont have kids its not worth it also screw  to  on top of inflexible working hours you have to waste your life away stuck in traffic because some morons decided it was a good idea to all go to work at the same time,0
who is waiting for freelees comment,0
dont say you are going vegan when animals died for that cake you put on your face,0
hell no they should compete in transgender race or male,1
blaire youre a hoe and a bitch and i love you so much  keep up the good work love,0
please do another video on her new videos about her being trans,0
an important info at   men are more willing and able to work long hours indeed and that might be the problem i would love to work longer hours a lot more fun than changing diapers trust me but someone has to come home to the kids and still today the mother is expected to do so if fathers would share the load of taking care of the kids equally with the mothers whatever gap that might exist would disappear,0
will jeffree and shane respond    lgbtq community is quaking,0
one piece of data that i would really like to see is some measure of the actual productivity vs wage gap thing that might be hard to get for some fields but for others like sales or something there ought to be a straightforward way to get actual productivity metrics to compare in order to defeatconfirm the theory that the wage gap is actually due to a performance gap,0
wasnt she a lesbian like a year ago,0
statistically if this goes onthere will be less qualified cis females who will be awarded statelevel sports scholarships,0
men need to step up and do more housework and child care so the work is split equally between men and women if that happened the wage gap would be much improved,0
my mum is a boss she earn more than my dad who is also a boss lol,0
whats up with her lip,0
i can understand both sides but stop calling them boys who identify as girls call them girls who were born male calling them boys is what makes it transphobic in my eyes,0
would be nice to see the source for the papers that are mentioned in the video a quick google search didnt help me,0
impressed by vox again you help me shut feminists up,0
when she slims from cutting out the fat  think she will look like pamela anderson,0
im vegan half raw and it changed my life half my diet is raw fruits and veggies and the other half is rice beans noodles etc and yes you can literally eat all day,0
plantbase is cool but whats more gmo then soy  we need to rethink the way we live and interact with nature as a species in all levels from how we live  eat and stop looking at nature as a commodity,0
i miss when the gap was bigger ,0
im so excited and i bet freele must be over heels now,0
i honestly feel like trishas just confused,0
yall im confused ,0
cut out oilexcessive fats to lose weight,0
why is that all meat eaters in this movie look so unhealthy,0
the only way for transgender athletes to compete in sports is to have some sports that includes both women and men you know like how they have mixed doubles in tennis with one man and one women thats honestly the only way i see it being fair for trans athletes,1
omfg get out,0
gee i wonder who disliked this video,0
well done freelee your continued effort will never be unappreciated,0
its a guy so race the guys,1
medjool dates is my fave fruit ever,0
just let them live their beautiful lives they want no matter what others say,0
yay for vegan love u even more trish ,0
lets say it straight  she has issues  not knowing where she belongs  as she desperately needs to belong  has issues with relationships not because she is transgender she has issues with her all relationships friends included because she is not mentally stable im not taking piss or making fun  she seriously needs help as she has delusional view on whats going on around her and with her  ,1

love this thank you,0
eat broccoli it has  times more protein than meat beans and nuts also have protein,0
even when you do take into account all the variables like occupation hours worked etc theres still an unexplained wage gap of  depending on whos doing the math,0
soooooo you debunk the wage gap right away then go on to say we need to force equality of median values between full working people regardless of education and job expertiese this is why everyone hates you,0
showing this to the students in my class who still think the wage gap is real even after i explained what the wage gap myth was based on but they didnt understand because theyre stupid ,0
sum up t is a female drag qween transgender very girly thick gay man with boobs and big butt and attracted to gay men only but sometimes she likes girls too,0
bruh she already failed she be eating chicken with waffles rn on her snapchat,0
this is a very reasonable exposition of this issue,0
omg i think i should try it too starting tomorrow,0
this is unfair,0
i support her im vegetarian and my goal is to become vegan,0
theres no gap if you work the same hours doing the same job youll get paid the same youre complaining that you get paid less for working less,0
so nice to see something based on facts and not on the media lying to us and spreading rumours there is some hope in this world,0
the wage gap was so misrepresented and basically a lie that outlets like vox are trying to salvage any last bit of legitimacy from it the problem is that the implied argument about fairness was never true why because the argument was tried in my view to try and subsidize female workers at the expense of male workers  that was the plan all along  something for nothing,0
you mean plant based diet being vegan is not a dietary restriction its a lifestyle and a stance against animal cruelty,0
so as a lot of comments point out you already stopped again and eat regular again koren bbq cheesecake why still upload this then its redundant now,0
the united states department said the wage gap is between  the aauw or the american association university for woman a feminist organization even said the wage gap is  almost identical to the usdl the wage gap is a result of choices not sexism,0
funny enough dem feminists they are not real feminists but just assoholic insane women that just hide behind real feminism to perform hate crimes cant even be accurate with the wage gap with they shit being like its  wait no its  wait no its ,1
if you like junky snacks once in a while or all the time in my case lol check out theveganzombies channel he has the best vegan junk food recipes good luck,0
i liked girltrish better somehow she was less naive,0
this is a good and informational video,0
do all vegans have butter faces ,0
well also that women are more expensive to keep at a workplace than men,0
this is vodka by the way what a fucking queen,0
do they make these videos for children or morons which is there target demographic,0
yeees it was the best choice of my life when i went vegan its ok to have setbacks so just focus on the times you do eat vegan especially when its hard like when you go out with friends to eat burgers or have a barbeque eating vegan is fun just go for a vegan raid in the grocery store and other places you can also order alot online hm yummy stuff well their is ice cream made from tofu or oat d and you can mae yummy smoothies from fruit like bananas and dates spiced with cinnamon or vanilla d and i love you for doing this  very good you dont just get mad at freelee and such you really listen and think big hug   lina sweden,0
avocado is high in fat and a lot of vegans say to not eat too much of it its freaking delicious though but i would just recommend eating beans not sure if they are high in fat and also just eating some really healthy veggies and fruits everything has a little bit of protein in it,0
soon we will be watching transgender sports and true girls will never be in sports again,1
at this point im waiting for her to come out and say that shes a gay alien from outer space i wouldnt put it past her tbh,0
you are so beautiful hotties chick i ever seen ,0
well that lasted long,0
the black outfit with the dark hair is giving me goth vibes and i am here for it,0
wage gap is a completely misleading and false term its absurd it should actually be called income gap income factors in different working hours different professions and pay rates nearly all the variables whereas wage is just too simplistic and focuses on just one variable the amoutn of money someone makes for  hour of their labour,0
im so proud that your actually trying this lifestyle in the end you will love it,0
im attracted to gay men sis so is gaga and she aint trans,0
look up vegan what i eat in a days  also youve gotta eat more than just one of those watermelon things for lunch lol guys just chill i know youre all mad about the chicken thing but seriously shes being more open to veganism than any other time before so instead of criticizing how about you give her the advice shes looking for jeez theres a reason why she doesnt like us lol,0
the best approach to climate change we conservative support,0
i respect the fact that those kids are sticking up for what theyre believing in and i highly dont like the fact that theyre receiving criticism for what theyre doing but if you were born a girl youre always a girl if you were born a boy youre always a boy just because you wanna change genders doesnt mean it actually happens but hey good for them,0
o gi gi what the hell lost alot of respek lost girl blair youre a fuking rockstar and girl im a straight guy but i love you to death you tell it how it is and i can get with some respect behind that real fast you better say hi please,0
i make a decent money but in my wifes and i social circle maybe   of the women make more money then me the women who dont are either stay at home mothers or dont have the same training experience that i do,0
from fuck peta to why im going veganfinally wow freelee youre a miracle worker,0
despite saying all this in the video im still viewed as sexist when i shoot down  of the pointd feminists try to use and fully supported the other  and to tell them things arent as bad as you are trying to say it is even though there is things that need to change still stuff like this is why i stopped supporting feminism,0
how old is this video cause i know you been eatin some bacon girl lol,0
could you please film what you are eating in a day when you are eating vegan xx ,0
to be fair there are misogynist people in some positions of power who tend to not promote women as readily not employ them or discriminate against them in other ways it really does happen and its not a thing that should happen and this could explain parts of a wage gap however most people arent like that and you dont tackle an issue effectively by exaggerating it to the point of absurdity and thus ruining your credibility in the public eye like most feminists these days do,0
in the netherlands young women actually make more money as young men but this is because more women have a education,0
that is awesome i live in la  there are so many good restaurants lets go to by chloe in hollywood and get a guac burger,0
wow wow wow so blessed to be vegan ,0
she doesnt like dressing up so shes a man i guess by that logic im a man now,0
i agree with pretty much everything you just said love,0
if they are going to change genders then force depleation of their muscle mass and structure,0
broccoli almond milk sweet patatos and lentils will all definitely give you that protein and what you need,0
freelee pretty please make a video about how you get your b i need help thank you,0
also anyone remember when jason  david would make gay jokesskits  trisha would talk soooo much shit about it  say how unattractive it was when he would act gay im finding this hilarious because she contradicts herself so hard like literally always,0
this is fucking stupid mangigi is like that friend in kindergarten who defends her friend who got hit by a pencil stop itttuh,0
how did trisha say exactly how i feel,0
i just got a davids vlog mercy adlmaoooo,0
its like shes trying to collect all the letters of the lgbtq like theyre pokmon or something,0
why not have a transgender team,1
what if that was marvin bracy or trayvon brommell lol,0
and thanks to the pussy c generation we have to tippie toe around the subject so not to offend anyone ,0
if animals didnt want to be eaten then why are they full of food,0
trisha dont just eat fruits and veggies you will get bored so fast get yummy vegan foods look up different vegan youtubers not just freelee,0
in other words there just isnt one,0
waring only caps fot rest you dumb mohterfucker dont you know its againts the law to pay someone less for their gender and pepole have diffrent pay for less and more experince its called new at job vs pro workersmh dude,1
thank you so much for making this trish i love you and am so proud of you you should download the happy cow app its like yelp for vegans roasted broccoli and bridle sprouts are really good with some soy sauce and sweet thai chili sauce or just salt and pepper and baked fries are amazing too and super cheap potatoes are so good for you and so yummy if youre looking for substitutes almond milk earth balance butter and vegenaise are great love you trish xxx,0
eating vegan snacks while watching thanks everyone for the hard work put into this ive been vegan for  month but already so happy i am,0
eat as much whole plant food you want fruits veggies grains beans you can eat vegan junk too but if youre looking for aesthetics stick to whole foods and drink a ton of water,0
sooooo very proud of you trish this is such a large step for you,0
how are u lesbiangay but also bisexual,0
i knew one day you would try it out so happy and excited for you btw the first few days you may have withdrawals from meat but thats totally normal and dont let it discourage you good luck,0
oh those poor people with their six figure salaries,0
women still take on a disproportionate share of childrearing tasks i agree this is true but this a decision made by the woman and her spouse their employerthe govtsociety have no culpability here if you want to do fewer domestic tasks marry a person who is willing to do more the reality is any man choosing to do more domestic work will also be in the same position its not gender discrimination its life choices resulting in calculable reduction in earnings over time,0
freelee look at trishs instagram post about chicken and waffles,0
question whats with the obsession of ending the wage gap as the video outlined its not that women are getting paid less for the same work and instead its more that theyre doing less work or working in lower paying fields this is the outcome of those womens choices they chose to go into that lower paying jobfield and they chose to work less hours so why does it matter why do we have to try and force changes just so the government can look at national earnings of the sexes and see that theyre balanced theres no inherent value to that,0
ok this does make sense but what about the so called glass ceiling is that a myth too,0
trish you look so good im proud of you,0
we love that women finally got equality in sports and now two men want to compete against us to beat us in our own category,1
trish would sell her family plus the dog and the parrot for money and attention,0
women also have to compete against transmen as well apparently id be fascinated to see how a transman in a m sprintmma fight against a transwoman would do,0
masculine woman checking in i have had people insist that i should be trans ftm because i like traditionally masculine hobbies like building houses fixing cars hunting etc i dont act girly so for some reason that must mean im trans im not perfectly content with being a woman and it really bothers me when people latch onto things like trans gay etc just to get that boost of popularity that comes with it even had someone insist re demand i not engender my child while i was pregnant with my son i digress people need to stop latching onto buzzwords for their five seconds of fame because it really harms the people who are legitimately trans or gay or whatever they are falsely claiming just my two cents,0
yay trisha im so glad youre going vegan the grapes are good but if you want a significant source of nutrients from them then you probably have to eat like one bag per day so i recommend not making the grapes into a meal but just having a few cups every day as a snack the bananas are good as well very good just make sure you eat them when they ripen because the bananas you showed in the video werent ripe and that amount was good for like one or two days if you really want to go seriously then those will not be enough for one day technically you are supposed to eat at least  bananas a day so take that into mind also freely eats like two or three of those bunches for breakfast the carrots are a good source of vitamin a but you should use those more in cooking than eating them raw just because its better to get all of your carbs in in the morning and then your vegetables are better later in the evening steaming the carrots corn green beans and other vegetables you like and pairing them with brown rice tastes very good watermelons are a good source of vitamin a c and will hydrate you but again the watermelon is better off as a snack and not a meal same with the cantaloupe most of the food you picked out is good for snacking and not really for meals you are going to want to pick up some dates mangoes potatoes brown rice almond milk or any other dairy substitute pasta is good chickpeas and lentils it is definitely recommended you eat raw in the morning and most of the afternoon and then cooked food in the evening if you think eating raw is too hard then just throw it all the fruit you want in a blender add a shit ton of water some almond milk if you want and some coconut sugar if you want also look up vegan recipes you can have for dinner and maybe even some desserts if you want dont worry about overeating as long as you are eating fruits and vegetables because you can have as much as you want without gaining weight of course after eating you will be bloated but it will mostly be water and after urinating your belly will go down its also good if you buy vegan multivitamins meant for vegans because if you are not very educated in nutrition you could end up with deficiencies i recommend the deva oneaday multivitamin  mineral i am glad you are taking this step and remember to eat if you are hungry and dont worry about calory intake you will not gain weight as long as you are eating right and remember always to carb the fuck up,0
why i looking at this best what you can do is listen to your body,0
 its factually incorrect,0
the wage gap has been debunked many many times,0
 most trans people when dating if they have transitioned fully just wont say they were male or female at birth if they want to tell the partner they will on there on time,0
you are so funny wow,0
what was the video you guys watched was it farm to fridge,0
i always thought she was really a man,0
waiting for freelee to make a video,0
im considering going vegan but i need some advice there is something which has prevented me from becoming vegan ever since i was little ive been naturally skinny its very easy for me to lose weight so i have to be careful not to skip meals or else my bmi will drop down too low either i have a very high metabolism or maybe i have some sort of issue with absorbing fat i have unresolved digestive issues as well but anyway it makes me feel like i need that extra fat in my diet thats in meat and dairy as unhealthy as it is im worried that if i go on a plantbased diet ill lose weight like all of the vegans seem to i really cant afford to lose weight should i be worried about a vegan diet,0
suck it feminazis,0
all the dislikes are those who dont like hearing facts,0
i really want to go vegan and i most definitely will once i move out of the house as a sophomore in high school its definitely harder for me to go vegan im a vegetarian for now my parents think its weird but whatever could you possibly make a video or just respond to this comment please on tips for high schoolers or people going to college because the majority of schools at least ones ive attended either dont have a vegan or vegetarian food option for lunch or if they do its salad bar which at my school has made people sick they ate tomatoes and beans from it and they vomited i usually pack a lunch but we dont have a lot of options fr lunches at my house so somedays i just do t eat lunch also what  of carbs fat and protein do you recommend getting in everyday,0
well this was uplifting lets keep going ,0
 venture capitalist  job lol get the fck out of here this woman doesnt know what shes talking about,1
claims to be a man wears rainbow sparkle stiletto nails,0
babe potatoes baked potato fries wedges did you know that a baked sweet potato is like less and  cals so filling,0
i dunno i think her video was funny to watch especially since im an actual trans guy,0
this is wicked,0
stock up on rice and potatoes theyre definitely a big part of my diet also theyre not the healthiest but gardein makes some bomb ass fake meats they have a bbq pocket that tastes just like pulled pork its heaven good luck trish ive loved even since before i went vegan xoxo,0
wow this is really what its come to huh,0
they make really good meatless chicken beef that tastes very similar to the real thing and they have lunch meat tofurky that is extremely good and they have meatless bacon thats good the beyond meat i believe its called that not sure but the chicken one has  grams of protein in each serving and you can eat brown rice lentils oatmeal potatoes tofu is really good if you season it right chickfila has a really good veggie wrap taco bell you can order vegan there they have mayo that is vegan i believe its called just mayo they have vegan pizza that has vegan cheese and vegan meat on it from daiya pizza and you can order pizza at dominos with no cheese and just get veggie toppings and the garlic dipping sauce they have is also vegan im so excited youre doing this this makes me so happy,0
rice rice rice  rice and beans and potatoes are such a big part of my diet now that ive gone vegan  i really hope you stick to this the first few days or so can feel sort of yucky since your body is detoxing but after that you feel suuuper good  you just have to make sure youre eating enough if you feel tired or gross its probably because you need to eat  good luck ,0
i appreciate your efforts but the butthurt feminists dont believe in facts,0
they need to have there own sport its wrong there still men,1
the wage gap is false men are more likely to go to work sick while women are more likely to call in sick and lots of time call in sick a couple days a month because its that time again and men are more likely to work overtime this is statistics not sexisim,0
im so proud of you i just hope you realise your body wont necessarily transform during just  weeks even freelee herself said she gained weight at first after going vegan also freelees body is percent exercise so incorporate the gym and taking walks to your new diet to achieve the most visible results,0
am i transgender yes  do i identify as my natural born gender yes  is she a stupid bitch yes ,1
thats so unfair man fuck that they need to be back in the boys track team,0
pls do a video on chloe ting and her lowcarb diet ,0
glad to see vox actually made an objective video for once that looks at both sides and only reviews facts and logic good job guys,0
this bitch is such a fucking liar lmao im screaming she cant go two days as a vegan,1
testosterone suppression is all well and good but it doesnt change the fact that having male genetics would have blessed these two with larger hearts larger lungs increased blood volume higher haemoglobin levels in their blood and on average increased basal metabolic rate longer limbs and denser bones to question whether or not they have a builtin advantage in the light of basic understanding of human anatomy biochemistry biomechanics physiology is absurd of course they have an advantage,0
she already tried this weeks ago she said she was going on her vegan diet never even happened itll neverrr happen not even for  weeks,0
i am not fooling with you today trish,0
women are really social and caring creatures we are so blessed to have women in our lives,0
women doing different jobs to men  difference in pay  okay women and men doing the same job  difference in pay  not okay,0
omg yaaassss trisha watch vegans grocery hauls on youtube whole foods has a lot of great vegan foods like pizzas cookies chips just eat whatever vegan food you want dont worry about being healthy at first just focus on only eating vegan foods good luck  i love you so much and im sooo excited to hear this     ,0
im a carnivore and proud stop preaching veganism its becoming a religion and a cult not healthy at all,0
i just think you need to take a break a long one,0
stop preaching this alt right  bigotry,0
women start this dont back out now ladies you allow this to happen,0
what people miss about the gender pay gap  it does not exist,0
all about that chick fil a though,0
the trans community has always called to me please for the love of god someone hang up,0
girllll the weight is going to drop off so excited for you ,0
realistically feminists are just going to forget about every fact stated in this video and go back to screaming like headless chickens in their lame ass parades,0
i think the allure of gay men because gay men doesnt salivaterate the hotness of a girl instantly lol  i understand the fetish for gay men sorry to say i am like that especially if they are in the closet because of their emotional longing feels beautifulthats just me thoughi dont know about other girlsthis fetish is bad because other than its very rude gay guys could manipulate those girls to get stuff lol ive seen it before also about being trans ive been told i was a tomboy for so long by people around me because im very nerdy and was hyper so there was a time i thought i was trans although when i rethink it hey i did excitingly anticipated having boobs and menstruation when i was younger so really to know who we are we have to really evaluate all of our emotions carefully but it depends on our goal i think trisha just clickbaiting hahaha,0
well freelee can eat a ton cuz shes a raw vegan but just cuz ur vegan doesnt mean all vegan food is healthy lots of vegan food can still have lots of fat and and sugar in it and u also realize most vegans w that body also work out a lot raw alignment is a great vegan channel here on youtube along with kalel,0
one are you saying you dont pay your workers equal pay two i read both documents and the study never redoes any of the experiments making them have a chance of being false three why would companys hire men if they can pay women less,0
quit victimizing them you fucks they do have an unfaur advantage,0
would have loved if they linked the studies,0
earnings have you not heard of the word earnings there is an annual gap in what the two genders earn amazingly there is a very sizeable earnings gap between the female neighbour in the house next door on my left and the female neighbour in the house on my right when i learned of this i needed to be revived with smelling salts one is a  year old with  babies receiving welfare but who supplements it with a casual retail job i was disgusted to hear she doesnt earn the same as my other neighbour who is a pharmacist who also owns two stores go figure theyre the same gender for gods sake,0
an easy snack is just to toss garbanzo beans in olive oil salt pepper  garlic powderroast at  for  minssuper savory you can roast a bit longer for a crispy version to get a chip fix too,0
the thumbnail of the vid looks like a joke for clickbait,0
were her lips caught in a house fire btw love you blaire,0
im pretty sure this was the video freelee was talking about in her one video saying how trish said she was going vegan for a bit yet she never uploaded the videoand obviously didnt go vegan so now trish uploads a what   week video when was freelee in la and expects us to believe shes going vegan for  weeks huh,0
what people dont see is that its complete bullshit,0
trish youre rich just subscribe to a service where professional chefs make you vegan food thats delicious,0
they are so brave,0
they are not women they are transgender,1
i dont believe in they them pronouns ialright,0
what did our great president say oh yes  whatever a man can do a women can do it to she can even do it better i guess he lied,0
this makes me hungry for chickfila,0
i had the biggest smile at the first line d,0
wheel that c is because when the house is burning down and my wife gets out im the who goes back to safe the kid or when were on a ship and it starts to sink my wife and kids get on the life boats and i stay or when ww starts women done get draft i will so that my view,0
congratulations freelee and this is epic freelee im back youve helped me over the years,0
thats not fair the female that came in third place won that race these two juwanamans damn near look like football players not fair,1
im so proud of you for doing this and omg i love freelee so much,0
you is fat,0
i can literally her freelees footsteps towards this video,0
welp quit watching after she said if women are paid so much less why dont businesses hire only women buddy friend pal if youre still repeating that nonsense argument you clearly have nothing to contribute women are paid less because their work is valued less than mens therefore businesses dont hire only women because they value womens work less would you hire a bunch of workers you believed are much lower quality workers simply so that you can pay them lower wages if you still lack this basic understanding of what the wage gap is then do not talk to me about why its fake if youre going to argue against something know what it is first sigh,1
its winter in aus and god damn shes wearing nothing and wind is blowing im cold just looking at you ,0
great vid but when did an angry  year old child greta t become such an expert on anything that you needed to put her in this vid and at the start to boot gimme a break pbn,0
replay announcer she won by a penis she won by peniss,0
tip dont eat salt,0
please you guys i want all of you to go to this account hamzajamjoom on instgram and report it that person uses animals in a bad bad way for his art,0
even though i am not a vegan or vegetarian myself something i actually enjoy that would be good is tofu also make sure you get enough protein by eating beans nuts or whatever else,0
im  vegan now,0
maybe what you meant you are gender fluid  gender queer  maybe idk  i just dont know but i dont think trans is the right label,0
youre literally the best lol,0
im gay and this is awful,1
penis envy sis thats a freudian theory that was disproved a long time ago,0
ok so now i feel like a female boxing lets crush now some girl face and get cup and gold medal for free,1
ok your a dude cheater,1
this is so great love u trisha xxxx,0
vegan over here in canada ,0
tbh i watch these slaughter videos and i would recommend it bc it keeps you going and reminds you why you ever went vegan,0
yay trisha please make sure you eat lots of dark leafy greens  beans for iron  protein xx so happy to hear this good luck dont be too hard on yourself i you feel like you cant do it  break the diet if you break it just accept it and then keep on trying just do your best,0
she made  thousand dollars from this video,0
fuck off you filthy filthy bitch,1
trish this is amazing i recommend eat lots of beans like chick peas and lentils also make sure to eat rice and pasta and lots of veggies,0
every time i see one of these videos i cringe a little women statistically are worse at asking for a raise so many studies have been done dont blame the dads like they arent taking the kids to soccer practise or what ever,0
also as a vegan starbucks barista i know that all our frappicinos taste great with soy because its vanilla flavored,0
also its illegal to pay a woman less so theres that too,0
every feminist needs to watch this,0
amazing  great coverage of vegan issues for her followers,0
nice lady sorry not interested good luck to everybody,0
trish was a high b drunk call of above when she said she would go vegan for  weeks,0
yayyy so happy that youre trying this,0
no one absolutely nobody at all not a single living thing in the known universe trish anyone who uses theythem pronouns has mulitple personallities,0
gender wage gap is a myth,0
im just waiting for the day a transgender person plays girls basketball and start dunking on people lol,0
not minutes in and already liked hard ,0
they are males tho,0
im pretty sure that if a women picks a dollar up off the ground that its actually only worth  cents while if it were a man it would be a whole dollar as such i found myself in a particular issue when my  year set of twins  male  female brought up the wage gap difference to fix this i found that the average  tooth fairy gift per tooth would be balanced by my daughter being provided more coins to equal the values they are both super happy that i had talked to the tooth fairy for them the tooth fairy tends to leave a little extra though providing the  for my daughter while this is a little more than the proper balance of money from the wage gap which my son isnt too okay with i see no problems with it when they get older and i have to pay them to clean their rooms ill probably end up doing the same thing as the tooth fairy that way everything is fair,0
i once worked as a punch press operator for about  months the guy before me got his hand shredded in one of the machines i saw the pictures and i was surprised that the doctors were able to put it together at all the job was  hours a day  or  days a week to have enough time to make food in the morning and get to work on time i woke up at  am there was only one woman that i ever saw there and she came in about once a week to help with accounting,0
trisha check out gardein products you can find them in target im just beginning my vegan journey also  its been  months now and i have been loving gardein good luck girlie,0
another reason is that women take more time off this is especially true for younger women mostly because of pregnancy,0
hi freelee i have been vegan for over a month now and i love it your videos have really inspired me the only issue i have is with my family i recently turned  and my aunt is concerned for my health because she thinks my body isnt fully developed she wants me to talk to her friend who is a doctor and i just dont know what i should say like i know all my facts on why i should be vegan but i was wondering if you could help me explain to her why its so good for your body at a younger age thank you,0
what happened to teaching our children that what makes us different and individual is what makes humanity beautiful,0
vegans dont think theyre better but the animals sure fucking do,0
sweetie your hair doesnt match your extensions also dont claim you want to make this channel about exposing pedophiles but befriend pedo adam,0
went vegan in  had a tremendous boost in my overall athletic performance and stamina recovery thanks dr mc dougall thanks klaus god bless you all,0
please make a few what i eat in a day videos during the next two weeks,0
god bless you womanyou speak the truth,0
i dont understand why the fuck those men who work in the slaughter houses have to be so cruel do they seriously only hire degenerates who have gotten out of prison to do that job what is up with the excess violence those men are not men they are little fucked up boys who never grew up with serious complex issues and probably tiny dicks,1
this is amazing ,0
am i the only person who doesnt think trisha is crazy and is just joking i kinda find it funny,0
nothing gives you a human the right to tell trisha another human what she is or isnt you are not her girl byyeeee,0
please go look at pewdiepies latest video its called why pewdiepie is the dumbest youtuber its important,0
this is going to sound absolutely awful but based on all your videos and everything i feel like you were probably sexually abused when you were young youre just very screwed up mentally youre not a gay man trish youre gender fluid not transgender literally look up the definition of gender fluid you dont have to use the pronoun they or them if youre gender fluid,0
i am going to trigger everyone i meet at school with this info,0
okay have you ever heard of a tomboy this video actually pissed me off,0
uhm are you okay,0
im so happy for you becoming vegan was the best decision ive ever made i wish you the best of luck,0
so what you mean is the gender pay gap doesnt exist,0
trisha this is probably the best choice you will ever make you ll never regret it,0
yay trish i would recommend getting vega smoothies they are vegan and when youre busy you can quickly drink one and they have  grams of protein and taste good morning star burgers vegan type you can try different vegan cheeses they are getting way better a lot of cliff bars are unintentionally vegan those are good especially if you are craving sweets almond milk is tasty you can make vegan curry and vegan chili pretty easily if youre having trouble sticking to it just try to focus on reducing dairy and red meat,0
im just waiting for freelee to make a video on this,0
okay this is epic what is ben shapiros wifes job,0
so if youre going vegan are you going to get rid of your designer bags that are made with real animal skin or any of your items made with real animal skin,0
trans and now its did xd,0
nice and eyeopening thanks im also years late but apparently thats how youtube recommendations work on the other hand even if  of the worse paying majors were male i still would like to see teachers early childhood educators included psychologist and social workers earn more there is no sexism in this wish either just the thing that these people do a lot to individuals and in my opinion should be valued more this claim that women chooose to study things that lead to lower wages sounded a bit like blaming women for earning averagely somewhat less but then who would do these jobs also if some men didnt do the dangerous jobs who would trust me there are men who would never work on an oil rig and there are women who would never even touch an elderly gentleman or lady or care for them professionally if they cant do this on their own i forgot the word for the home where they live then no i do not compare these jobs and you should neither do that because they are enterily different and not comparable i would like to add the situation in my country beginner teachers earn circa  usd per month without the taxes nurses or social workers who work with the elderly or homeless for example earn even less i now simply dont trust my owm calculations because it seems so few like  dollarshour compared to american wages yes things are a bit cheaper there and we have free universities but my point is that these people do not earn enough money regardless of their gender edit for correction of sentencestructures i struggle with english,0
a wagegap as described by contemporary feminists doesnt exist end of conversation,0
to be honest videos like this is are why no one takes the lgbtq community seriously how can we expect people to not make fun of us when theirs people like trisha who use serious topics such as being transgender as a way to get more views and publicity this honestly disgusts me im sorry,0
this isnt sexism its just common sense that is all folks,0
love it your someone who spreads the truth,0
im a  yr old straight femaleand ive been a bitch my entire life and not to be one nowbut can somebody tell me what this womans situation isnever been here beforenot fucking sure why this is in my recommended vids help,0
i am ashamed of cousins and certain aunts and uncles who think that there is gender discrimination in payment really ashamed they unfortunately follow the herd mentality,0
i honestly dont mind going vegan it can be healthy infact it is but what holds me back is that is tastes like dogshit simple as that vegan burger cant be compared to a real burger meat is like sex its like u guys are telling me to stop having sex i can do it less ofcours but stopping it is impossible for me till they make that food taste  as good as meat then i can change to vegan until then i cant as a natural skinny person that is a picky eater if i go vegan i would either loss all my teeth because of eating too much goddamn sugar or starve myself,0
best explanation of the fake gender wage gap im so glad i continued to watch this since it was merely an ad on another video its all spot on thank you for sharing,0
im a vegetarian and i eat couscous all the time its vegan and its really tasty if you mix some vegetables and sauce into it,0
the u cut that hair hair part is kinda stereotypical tho lol,0
literally just look at the equal pay act,0
you dont see the girls who claim they are dudes getting into man sports lol the boys get in female spaces because they know they will win,1
i would be very interested to see a study of the correlation between assertiveness and aggressiveness with income the more driven and assertive and confident you are the higher your income seems likely to be assertiveness and aggressiveness are linked to testosterone men have demonstrably higher testosterone levels i think the wage gap is as simple as biology,0
i am sorry i am not able to understand something here isnt wage gap issue regarding the difference in payment for same work done we are still comparing the womens salaries to there men counterparts isnt that exactly what the problem is if the job hours are from  the women has no obligation to stay back for a meeting at  and persons other priorities like children etc cannot be criticized by people and should not affect the wages of a job which heshe are doing well,0
i love this go trish ,0
you are so brave anyone who downvotes this is homophobic,0
ohhhh myyyy goshhhh yessssssss,0
trish i was vegan for two months i am  years old you cant just eat fruit i went to the doctor and i found out i am severly anemic please be careful and dont hurt yourself like i did make sure to consume a balanced diet that will keep you happy and healthy i was already underweight and i lost more weight which was very bad for a  year old be careful my vegan diet ruined me,0
holy fuck i am so fucking proud of you much love trish,0
they will have testosterone because they have testicles taking estrogen will lower it but their bodies will still be making it,0
the sex based pay gap is a lie the inference by feminists is that a man and a woman working side by side doing the same job dont get paid equally that is a lie the pay gap is an average of all male and female workers across all careers the reason men as a whole make more than women as a whole is simple you dont see as many women choosing to work dangerous demanding hazardous jobs how many maternity ward nurses are dying from black lung like coal miners do how many social workers are  week long shifts non stop like oil rig workers or working construction on buildings with only a harness for    weeks without break men also tend to work more hours every week so obviously theyd be paid more equal pay isnt possible unless theres equal effort so ladies if you want the pay gap to decrease stop going to school to be a florist and join a fire academy otherwise shut the hell up and stop saying things like being a mother is the hardest job in the world if you can do your job in your pajamas then no its not the hardest job in the world,0
im sorry who the fck makes   year out of business school  no seriously just graduated need that kind of money newly bba graduate,0

gardien has amazing fake meat if you start to miss it ,0
another great video thank you so much,0
so many feminists in the comment section supporting the feminazis at vox,0
coming from a genderfluid person to me it sounds like she might be genderfluid or maybe nonbinary also people using the pronoun they dont have disassociate personality disorder i use theythem pronouns personally for several reasons  it feels a lot more neutral to me and i prefer that sometimes people using her and he make me feel highly uncomfortable and i know its not right so i use theythem because i feel like it fits me more also they is used as a singular pronoun a lot in english when you dont know someones gender you use theythem like if someone said oh its my friends birthday today a perfectly normal response would be oh tell them i said happy birthday ergo theythem can be used as a singular pronoun and a lot of people feel more comfortable with that and thats aokay,0
this is a very misleading video and clearly has a lot of the people in the comments confused first off the title of this video is clearly wrong within the video it states that there is a wage gap but that it is produced by choice from this position you must then ask why women are choosing lower paid jobs there are multiple answers to this firstly the patriarchal society in which we live has tended to pay male dominated industries more this is not necessarily because these industries are of more value it is due to unions and wage debates over decades secondly women are told from a young age that they will be a nurse teacher or any other female dominated industry this is through all kinds of life also the idea that women should be the ones looking after a child are outdated this is a joint task for both parents,0
what about the homeless bias women are much less homeless than men i think you should cover this,0

women workers will not always be ready to be in the office when the firm needs them or work long hours without advanced notice because they simply have different responsibilities such as taking care of the household in addition individual career choices are often influenced by social environment and upbringing,1

this video is misinformed and misconstrues a georgetown study titled women cant win despite making educational gains and pursuing highwage majors women still earn less than men to manipulate its audience one main finding of the study is discrimination even when women do everything rightchoose a highpaying field of study pursue a highpaying major within that field and get a job in a highpaying occupationwomen still get paid less than their male peers if a man and woman who are equally qualified get the same job the woman still only earns  cents for every dollar the man is paidmore than cents to be sure but a far cry from earnings equality to not include this principal finding of the  page study is disrespectful to the truth of the gender wage gap which might not be that every woman earns  cents to every  dollar a man earns but it still exists at a  cent deficit according to the sited georgetown study shame to prageru for disrespecting the truth and mission of this study spreading factually incorrect data with conviction and manipulating its millions of viewers,0

i have literally only watched three videos and i love her she is so funny,0

sehr guter rckblick go vegan ,0
so what youre saying is that its not a wage gap but its because jobs dont have flexible hours good to know,0
look up mommy tang the youtuber,0
questionif women get paid less then men wouldnt it be advantageous for a business to hire just women in order to save on operating costs ,0
just a questionyou like saying to diff trans people that they are not trans not that i am defending trish payatasbut wellwho the hell made you the authority of who is trans or not how do we know you are really trans you say you are transbut how do we know you are really trans maybe you have been pulling a fakeout just for views and attention,1
so shes basically saying shes gender fluid but the truth is she just wants everyone to be sexually attracted to her ,0
when i went vegan i ate the same kinds of food just vegan junk food when i began its all a journey and i lost lbs in  weeks and i was still eating loads i educated myself and learnt more and my food has got so much better i went from  stone lbs btw im ft im now down to  stone lbs i dont diet i just eat when im hungry and my weight has stabilised and maybe i go down a little bit very slowly i think if you want to carry on check out bitesizevegan channel for education as to why you should stay be vegan and shes lovely ,0
what they miss the fact that it doesnt exist ,0
sooooo you cant beat the boys so you pretend to be girls so you can win for once,1
i got a brain cancer because of that video,0
how is it harsh that people say they have an unfair advantage for being born boys if theyre boys they dont have to be competing against girls even if theyre transgender its too early for them to be competing as if theyre already female ,0
giiiiiiirrrrlll youve lost ittttttt ,0
some frozen amys meals are vegan most are vegetarian so look on the back,0
hag be quiet,1
the beginning of this video is already wrong the wage gap compares wages within the same job inform yourself,0
hey i have a video sugestion on a new videoyou should go back on one of your old youtube channels and talk about it,0
its very unfair that penis gives you testosterone which is an advantage run against men in your women clothes ,0
im so happy for you trying out the healthiest possible lifestyle your hair will glow better your nails will become healthier your skin will be the clearest it has ever been i cant wait to see how much you end up loving the vegan lifestyle   ive watched your videos randomly over the last  years and this one pushed me to officially subscribe,0
well over  of work place deaths are men now let me ask you should there be a earnings gap or not,0
just because you look like a drag queen doesnt mean youre a drag queen,0
what makes this even better is the chick fillet,0
i saw one person on an instagram post talking about meds and what they do to your head they said a lot of people they know that took meds were saying strange shit about their sexuality and changing it trisha definitely has metal health problems and is probably on meds i think she is dont quote me on that im not defending her but if this is cause by meds then i feel bad for her but i also wanna wait and see if shane literally trishas best friend will say anything about this,0
i think vox failed to notice that women dont have the same jobs as men,0
this is awesome im so happy you made this choice for breakfast this best thing i love is freezing bananas and blending them with nondairy milk into ice cream and mixing with toppings its amazing also potatoes really fill you up good luck xo,0
right off the bat i smell propaganda in this video they talk about profit,0
do you get maternity pay in usa in britain women always had longer time off than men but its been fixed now so men and women can share the maternity leave so the woman has the right to go strait back into work as soon as she has given birth and the man can stay at home to raise the child obviously the women might need a week off after giving birth but that shouldnt affect her career,0
anyone man or woman that is a business or financial major knows that there is no such thing as a wage gap,0
why dont youtube put prager u videos on top trending but keep promoting leftist hysterical nonsense,0
unfortunate but true,0
freelee just want to say that l think your channel is very relevant to the discussion of diet nutrition and health l have subscribed to it and l will watch your postings even if l dont comment take care,0
 was the year of the ex vegan  will the year of anti veganism,0
shes not vegan anymore it lasted like one day lol,0
 ahe also identified herself as chicken nugget ,0
thought i would try a plant based diet for a month after  years as a vegetarian  months later and i havent gone back,0
alright i feel like this needs to be said i never comment on her videos but i see more hate here than on any other channel its annoying because most of you dont realize that  she likes the hate its attention  the hate she gets is perpetuating the on the kitchen floor videos and anything similar trish reads the comments and sees the views and then she does whatever it takes receive that same amount of attention  most of you think that shes just a stupid blonde but look at her she will soon be approaching  million subscribers and she gets tons of views she lives in la in an extremely nice house drives a g wagon and has designer everything despite what you think about her lifestyle the only thing most of you have to complain about her is her weight problem im not saying she is healthy by any means and she clearly has an eating disorder but shes at least aware of it she clearly has some psychological issues with attention disorders anxiety depression and she gets attached to things and people which indicated an addictive personality not to mention her past drug use she has issues so does everyone else however she works harder than most other youtubers i watch she posts consistently and has a hugely wide variety of content shes open on the internet and if you actually listen to some of the serious things she talks about shes more intelligent than you might initially think im not saying she makes the best choices and i dont agree with everything about this girl but i can appreciate someone who takes this much time toward something she works hard on her musicdancing which isnt my favorite but i still applaud her for keeping up with it anyway what have most of you done with your perfect lives,0
if the wage gap is caused by women having babies then that means the mothers will be taking care of the baby while the husband is making the money for the familyunless of course they are a single mom with all  kids because its incredibly difficult for a man to get custody of even  of their kids why are all these self entitled brats waging a war in society about rights,0
inhales deeply thank you,0
you are young and you are brilliant i absolutely respect your opinion,0
who is this woman and why is she so smart,0
what was their track record before they transitioned probably mediocre,0
almost every woman i know makes more than me ,0
wondering no one is wondering notice its never figure skating or the floor routine in gymnastics frickin track  wrestling if men arent allowed testosterone as a ped because having twice the testosterone is cheating how is  times the testosterone different just cuz ur insane and idc what hormones u take u built the muscle with testosterone different skeletal structure height upper body strength higher calf muscles youre not lugging around boobs or a uterus like wtf is wrong with these people,1
freelee where are you,0
lets be perfectly honest its got nothing to do with fairness or even economics its all about power and these feminist groups want that power if they could push themselves into the right seats they could effectively start deciding who would get certain benefits and life styles while others would regulated to ostracation this is communist manifesto ,0
yay yay yay,0
heres a tip coming from a ftm trans man stop stereotyping men and women saying that even if you acted slightly more masculine that makes you trans or a man and the reason you like gay men is most probably a fetish cause i know a lot of cis women who find gay men attractive and it is normal to wonder what it would be like to be the other gender but because you question that doesnt mean you are trans so yeah stop before all the angry lgbt members come and attack you,0
but you cant really force someone to eat something,0
you couldnt have waited two days to post this,0
that it does not exist,0
lmfao damn these dumb fucks are off the hook quite being bitchs n back to the guys side of sports fuckboys,1
this aint it sis,0
hey freelee if possible please address pewdiepies recent upload to youtube in which he complains about a vegan giving criticism the video with that on his channel is why pewdiepie is the dumbest youtuber,0
i just watched from farm to fridge and omfg its so terrible ,0
yes haters are going to hate nonetheless i think it is good youre trying or at least talk about this lifestyle on the top of my mind and considering what you might like check out  banana ice cream  cauliflower cheesy sause for mac n cheese  avocado chocolate pudding  chickpea chocolate chip raw cookie dough  chickpeas meringue  zucchini noodles,0
im turning of a haters of yours,0
freelee looked so happy ,0
you opened this video up with misinformation the statistics are based on what women and men make on average per respective position meaning that the gap varies over different jobs etc but on average is on  cents not  if you were telling the truth you could have linked to credible sources in the comments,0
lol idk why i clicked this but pls tell me if this is another dumb feminist or someone normal i dont want to get cancer,0
first of all gay people or binary whatever the hell you people want to call yourselves yall arent the only ones in the world with the right to free speech so you can get down off your high horses you dont want anyone judging you yet you judge everyone else just a bunch of spineless pussies,1

stfu everyone women wanted to see equality in the same class and they got it it is not right but now feminists can see that men are physically superior btw if it were females competing in male races everyone would be like you go girl,0
who is this person why do they look like they had really bad plastic surgery done and why does this person have to have the same first name as me,0
id be happy for them and itll only motivate me to run faster yeah ok,0
 triggered feminists,0
omg you guys are going to make me nut if you keep whispering sweet nothings into my ear like that,1
this video was really well explained and informative it shows that the wage gap is real but not for the stereotypical reasons that are being put out,0
stop the earth rn im getting the fuck off ,0
this stupid myth is imposed by the socalled feminists but the only thing it seeks is a way to generate inequality and at the same time victimization which is its only flag what a joy it is a lady that makes such a good explanation and k feminazis do not like this xd,1
maybe look into gender fluid,0
trisha needs a straight jacket  some heavy duty psych meds stat,1

she totally blew past the fact that the bar graph showed just as high numbers of shared equally vs mothers do more so yes fathers do more only had  but isnt that the goal to have shared equal responsibilities isnt that what the feminists want oh wait thats right though they want it to be men do more work,0
trisha youre not trans lesbian or bi youre and attention seaker ,1
who is at   thanks in advance,0
when i saw her vid i said aiiight imma head out,0
well done for giving women a voice that will gain them genuine respect,0
this video was shot a while ago the music video she was talking about was daddy issues which is already out and she was wearing this outfit like  weeks ago before she went out with shane im sorry guys but the two weeks she was referring to are already over and she didnt go vegan after all ,0
yea im only  and a male and i plan to be the ceo of my own tourist trap in japan my sister fashionz,0
so are men and wemon still equalsif so why cant the girls out run the boysim confused,0
so there is a wage gap its just much smaller than people advertise and it relates to a variety of thing that are much more complex than just gender and sexism,0
such crap aauw never published such a study there is a pay gap dont be stupid,0
do i identify as transgender  do i identify with the gender i was born  i dont think you understand how percentages work,1

trisha really seems to struggle with her identity i dont know her or her content that well only hear about her a little from emelia fart and shane dawson but from what ive seen im thinking she might have histrionic personality disorder  as i cant comment on bpd seeing as how i dont know how much she fears abandonment maybe someone can inform me on that trisha definitely shows signs of radical attention seeking behavior and seductive mannerisms she covers quite a few of the symptoms of a histrionic cant take criticism well had a breakdown because ethan from hh goofed a little bit on her seems to make rash decisions now she believes shes trans which isnt something anyone should take that lightly being overly concerned with physical appearance even though here she claims she walks around wearing no makeup but thats moreso when shes alone which is different etc cant say for sure though since i dont watch her content directly nor do i know her personally she does generally give me a bad vibe like i can tell i wouldnt want to meet her in person ever,0
its hard to like listen to you seriously like when you talk with vocal fryyyyyy it sounds like you need a lozenge,0
guys the video trisha posted was  weeks old and she had ended her vegan trial but she still posted the video on youtube freelee should do some research before hand,0
u should watch mommy tang,0
you should buy morning star farms products theyre all vegan options highly recommend the black bean patties ,0
there is light at the end of the tunnel great video  govegan,0
can you believe there are actually hard working people out there that actually contribute something to society just like my mom who was a single mother raising me and my autistic brother who is very low functioning while working hard my whole entire life that get such a shitty paychecks and basically no recognition for the hard work they put in but girls like trisha paytas are millionaires being idolize and people wanna be just like her but all shes doing is making such idiotic and crazy videos basically being a moron on the internet for a living its just fucked up and not right people like her are the reasons why the youth is so fucked up these days most kids have no clue what it means to respect themselves and respect others and we all know she actually doesnt identify as being trans shes just doing this coming out video for moneyviews thats basically the narrative of all her videos and that some how makes her a queen please this world is so shit,1
the think people look over is that theres not one,0
eat until ur full eat an entire watermelon for lunch not just those spears,0
good for you  check out hot for food on youtube you can eat rice pasta beans fruits veggies salad smoothies nuts seeds etc you wont gain weight so long as you eat healthy food a diet of oreos and original pringles is vegan but its not healthy its okay to eat some unhealthy food just dont overdo it my favorite vegan treat is ben and jerrys dairy free ice cream and daiyas cheezecake i found it at whole foods good luck on your journey much love ,0
im so happy for you trish i really hope you have an amazing vegan journey,0
hate it when someone says st im going vegan to look good arrrgghhhh,0
never watch video go on to posting opinion about the wage gaps existence,0
simple truth men in same jobs do not make same pay either this is fact this is called negotiation men do not force their employers to pay equal to compensate for their varying negotiating ability save for strikes and union representation if women want true equality they just have to learn to negotiate better without coercion of the law or using their feminine character in any way learn to play the game they so desperately wish to a be a part of in a truly fair way,0
why dont women just have less kids i dont think any would really mind if a family has one or two children instead of  or three children also women with a lot of kids almost never work if you have three kids then u really shouldnt expect to go back to work until right around when the gap shrinks again,0
omg i love kalel i screamed when you mentioned her ogmfomgo kalel is like my actual idol i love her so much and you mentioning her just made me want a collab from you two crosses fingers i want my queens united,0
loving the positivity in this video,0
whats a crow mukbang,0
i am not a feminist and this video does set some facts but without drawing the conclusions from them i have to say that  as a woman i observe that men are sometimes if not regularly macho towards women even in a way that they may perceive as normal or harmless i dont believe its always purposely mean but therefore they do not respect women entirely while its much more more rare that a woman would have any kind of despise towards men just for being men women usually value men as much as themselves  if its true that women often make choices that lead them to less well payed jobs its partly because they are surrounded by social messages that tell them some jobs are for men and they wouldnt fit in it im not saying its caused by all men nor that all women suffer from it but its true for a certain prcrentage of people and may explain the unexplained wage gap in this video which is ridiculously presented as unexplained while the answer is im sorry quite obvious and quite real once again im not saying that women are all oppressed by men but men make the more social oppression as they make the more sexual assaults take this as a remark from someone who doesnt care about gender when looking at someone but about respect and truth,0
as a gay man i dont find this offensive i just see a person explaining how they feel and just trying to figure out their identity as a person,0
im going vegan tomorrow starting  fresh,0
ugh i hate makeup  omg am i trans ,0
freelee is gonna have a cow or a banana ,0
we need to call out bolsonaro and his cronies preferably we need to create and sign a petition to hold him accountable for the destruction of the amazon and the earth he and his family are militia criminals that will do everything for money,1
i finally get it feminists want communism,0
if youre worried about protein theres a lot of meat substitutes that taste realistic if youre craving it the brand gardein is great and beans are so filling and you can put them into so many meals so proud of you,0
why post this if you decided right after filimng to not even be vegan are you actually going to be vegan,0
yaay it might be hard for some to flip a switch and go vegan but since youre so determined to do this lifestyle for the next two weeks and hopefully enjoy it and continue it can be made simple eat enough calories please do to get the full satisfying experience of feeding your body the healthiest and foods in abundance watch the oil you can easily replace oils with water and its literally the same effect with less grease  just because its vegan doesnt mean its healthy i know vegan cookies are a temptation but make sure to eat clean and by that i mean eat simple use youtuber mommytang for some awesome simple vegan food ideas im so proud of you for doing this and i hope everything goes amazing,0
omg im so happy shes becoming vegan,0
sorry to say it but this will never stop simply because we have opened pandoras box and told people that they can basically do and be whatever they want and its acceptable so why wouldnt they cross this line its a matter of time before transgender men start going into the wnba those poor girls dont stand a chance and that sucks,1
yes trish finally i am so proud of you dont listen to the haters you can do this i believe in you eat lots of plant starches and dont worry about protein if you feel you need more protein i recommend the spicy chicken boca burgers theyre soooo good keep researching online watch freelees videos watch earthlings watch bite sized vegans videos keep doing that research girl you got this,0
the wage gap has been reduced since  thats a given noone claimed there to be a  wage gap in  in fact back then the wage gap was closer to  to  on a long term effect laws and policies have lowered the gap considerably you can argue that women have different jobs than men but the fact is that they dont work  less hours so they shouldnt be paid  less regardless of what their occupation is you see the exact same thing when you compare the  poorest americans with the other  of americans the hour difference is nowhere near being equal to the wage difference,0
women chose to make less money got it,0
excuse me whay,0
try to get a meat substitute so you dont crave it,0
until they can bleed from their cocks every  days they should be banned,1
love u trisha  check out the vegan corner they make good recipes you go gurl,0
finally someone says the right thing and this coming from vox of all people,0
oh lord help her,0
very well done,0
yes trisha i went vegan  weeks ago and its great the beginning can be a little confusing but once you get into the lifestyle its amazing,0
trisha for protein eat lentils and beans rice and pasta are also good to have with veggies dont just eat fruit and vegetables they wont keep you satisfy you also oatmeal and fruit for breakfast is always good i even have oatmeal as a snack too look up recipes,0
they dont want people to stop the meat and dairy industry cuz then hospitalpharmaciesgrocery stores restaurants and funeral and more would drop money earning  thats why they use lies saying meat and other no good stuff are better then plant base diet,0
until women start preferring cute men who make substantially less money than they do nothing will change men work longer and harder to make more money because it gets them more access to more pretty women,0
whats going on with your instagram,0
oh blair i love your character  you are so cool im gonna write you and jacklyn parts on my book so maybe in a different version of life you guys can have rolls in the movie lmao i just love love love this,0

yeah yeahoh yeah wage gap aint real folks,0
you gained weight on a vegetarian diet because of all the dairy but you can eat as much fruit vegetables and carbs potatos rice pasta as you want your acne will go away bc the dairy causes it and dairy also causes weight gair so its a total plus you can do it im so proud of you  weeks if better than non eat lots and i mean lots of fruit in the morning you can have oatmeal too eat a lunch filled with vegetables and lots of lettuce and greens and carbs and for dinner eat tons of cooked delicious carbs also dont forget you probably have metabolic damge so dont be mad if its not instant weight loss you will look great for you video goood luck and enjoy,0
can somebody link me the study mentioned in the beginning of the video,0
this is my first time watching this channel so forgive me if im completely wrong but did she say that she say that nonbinary people dont exist and they didnt before a certain year because that doesnt make any sense to me sorry if i miss heard,0
yall dont be such a dick to t the shit shes saying makes sense if you would bother to listen past the terminology that gets mixed up in here whats being said here is that t from the get go has not really felt like a girl but the reason she was so girly so feminine was to compensate for everyone calling her a boy when she was young when she puts on makeup nails clothes etc etc shes in drag its a costume its an outfit the way she describes women makes it clear that she doesnt feel like shes one of them i do agree w some people here that what shes describing here sounds more like being genderfluid than binary trans and i do agree that shes mixing up a lot of words but you cannot blame her for ignorance you cannot thrust someone out from the community for not getting everything  right we are not born knowing everything that needs to be and should be said or how to say it you need to learn these things at some point and some people do them later than others i for one completely support t and agree with what shes saying even if shes not doing it perfectly you fucking go its hard to do shit like this,0
anybody else notice that womans eyes were huge,0
so since men get more you should treat men bad oh i see now look who became bad pls i just wanna have equal the same,0
its an extremely selfish way to look at it they and their parents are only interested in their own gains not anything else they need to express themselves if this madness is allowed to continue it will be the death of womens sports,1
what a slap to feminists by being told this by a women,0
im only  years old and i have became vegan slowly i have watched earthlings and many more documentarys but i love watching freelee regan the vegan and the laptop vegan as they are inspiring to me d d,0
ive been vegan for six months and i would recommend lots of pasta and rice one of my favourite things is spaghetti with pesto and load of veggies keep it simple samosas vegan burgers loads of stuff with potatoes and lentils etc i would honestly give yourself more than a few weeks it took me about a month to feel like a proper vegan and have my body be completely used to the food im eating so glad your going for it its the best thing ive ever done  good luck x,0
what if trisha is just saying that in order to get the attention she wants from gay men lol,0
even if trish is just doing it for attention at least she is getting the message out to her fans and subscribers and perhaps encourage them to do the same nothing wrong with that,0
i fucking knew she was gonna make a reation video to it ,0
if you drink alcohol please make sure you eat enough protein or you will have the worst hangover of your life i learned that the hard way,0
shes just a fucking sheepi was considering going vegan til i watched and listened to this channeli eat more fruit and veg than i do meati dont like the taste of meatbut be fucked if im going to become like these crazy bitches,1
i am so proud of you trish and btw i get most of my protein from beans,0
definitely scroll through instagram and pinterest for vegan ideas  youll love it,0
posts multiple videos of herself in a tiny bikini i always feel as though i have male energy,0
i think shes a train wreck,0
she has mental illness,0
trisha i hate this sexist society title i am transgender,0
go off trish so happy that youre taking this step on your own and are avoiding what freelee does in shaming other youtubers and that you still keep yourself grounded compared to people who do eat meat i personally eat meat but veganism is something i have been considering purely from a cruelty standpoint ,0
with a vegan diet you can eat as much as you want eat a lot of fruit and eat until you are full for the first couple weeks your body will be getting used to your new diet so you might have to use to bathroom a lot more please keep going and keep researching,0
trish doing what she does best trolling,0
i hope to see what i eat in a day vegan videos in a few months d,0
the edgy vegs youtube channel has great vegan recipes that you could try,0
i dont care much for most girly stuff but im still a female ,0
umm those are dude,0
ive never seen freelee this happy,0
breaking news male athletic star is faster than a female in the same sport coming up next the earth is round,0
you look gorgeous in this video,0
they dont belong there compete in your own transgender division,1
wait didnt she get boob surgery and lip surgeryalso why did u say am i trans while saying am i what i was born as,0
this video doesnt prove diddly including the dots ,0
 is not the same as  both feminist and antifeminist are more concerned about promoting their narrative than the truth,0
ive never seen this trisha person before what is all over her face she looks like a homeless person homeless woman,1
two dudes runningrun with men not girls who want to persue their dreams,1
ahaha people are focusing on one certain thing from the video and acting like its the only reason she gave and i bet they didnt even watch the whole thing,0
now i know why people say i shouldnt look at the comments,0
this is so exciting agh wtf yayyyyy,0
ive operated consulted for and owned various businesses like most entrepreneurs administrators consultants and executive my focus was hiring persons who were smarter than i was less for me to do and maximizing profits if i could have hired women and paid them less than men for the same job i would never have hired men the fact that men have these overpaid jobs and are even hired is contrary to any bottomline consideration and that is the big lie in all this,0
i understand that theres a lot of day to day pressure of being a woman that many of us wish didnt exist but i dont feel like that makes you trans but i mean as long as youre happy im not one to talk,0
the voice of reason yet again thanks blaire,0
a sincere thank you for addressing this its a kick in the goods to pseudo bias research the like of which should be utterly destroyed with fire and hatred,0
im a biological woman and i identify a  as a woman i like feeling powerful with activities like axe throwing or archery tag i never wear makeup i dont really do my hair i hate wasting time with appearances in her opinion i guess i should feel like im a man thanks for all your videos blaire youre awesome,0
the equal pay act of  is a united states labor law amending the fair labor standards act aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex see gender pay gap it was signed into law on june   by john f kennedy as part of his new frontier program wikipedia im glad the wage gap doesnt exist theres my evidence,0
accurate until about the  second mark a new record,0
beans for protein and if you dont like beans maybe just take a supplement to make sure youre getting all your vitamins,0
congratulations d  going to give love and advice to trisha now d ,0
wtf is wrong with her face im not being a dick im genuently asking did she have an accident was she caught in a fire,0
trader joes also has meatless prepared stuff you pop in the oven good luck,0
has she lost her god forsaken mind  ,1
the gender wage gap does not take into consideration how many hours people work or what job they work,0
i think its great that youre trying it  eat lots of fruit crackers oatmeal bread rice beans veggies hummus smoothies vegan burgers wraps stirfry take b and calcium supplements too make sure to check all the ingredients in everything as well you can find lists of ingredients of what to watch out for good luck eat as much as you want but dont over indulge,0
awesome work pbn question what  biggest environmental studies ed referred to,0
it is always entertaining the mental gymnastics the trans youtubers present males impersonate females and want to date males  the shortcut is they are actually gay females impersonate males and want to date females  the shortcut is they are actually lesbians the idea that children are born with an innate gender identity which develops prenatally and is impervious to environmental influence is not supported by any credible science body and brain are interconnected scientists have found no separate innate gender area of the brain which is fixed at birth childrens brains are very plastic they develop through interaction with people and the environment and they are constantly absorbing information and influences which shape them,0
its cause they werent counting ethots,0
this is actually a pretty fair treatment of the gender wage gap the disparity certainly does exist but its cause is rooted primarily in the different life decisions men and women make namely child care as this video suggests  not misogyny which is what many mainstream feminists would have us believe,0
i think trisha is just trolling once again,0
veganuary  is coming  was the year that i became vegan i lost kg without any exercise between may and october and am feeling really good and healthy im even looking forward to checking my cholesterol levels again in january because i can feel the difference in my health,0
can anyone recommend any vegan cheese id be a vegan as opposed to a veggie if i could find a decent vegan cheese ive gone totally cruelty free thanks to freelee by not eating meat and replacing all my makeup and household products with cruelty free items the only food i eat from an animal is cheese but if anyone can recommend a delish vegan cheese available in the uk id be so grateful ,0
hmmm i like feminism makes entire video about false statistic,0
this is funny,0
if she becomes vegan will she still be that stupid,0
yay congratulations trisha the next  weeks even if it is just that will save the lives of many animals  losing weight as a vegan in my experience the freeleeworshippers will differ is mostly veggies and fruits a smoothie for breakfast a brown rice wrap with tomato lettuce avocado spinach arugula a smear of hummus or vegan cream cheese kite hill only good brand for lunch and a small pasta kite hill even has ricotta cheese ravioli if you get a cheesy craving for dinner we have as much junk food and fattening food as any other diet if you eat just oreos and vegan ice cream potato chips nudge most bbq salt and vinegar and original flavored are vegan you wont lose weight dieting as a vegan is still dieting you just get to feel more full because vegan foods tend to be less calorie dense and more filling you should expect to feel weird kind of sick then kind of good digestive changes will make you feel weird its natural good luck girl,0
this reporter says that medical research cant really identify the line were a competitive advantage might exist for transgender athletes of either gender well that is a lie,0
all i could think the whole vid is can you pass me some chickfila,0
freelee where you at,0
fuck freelee honestly but ily,1
rice is vegan buy some rice,0
youre so lucky you are in la and you have access to ben  jerrys dairy free ice cream  definitely take advantage of that when you need something sweet also dark chocolate,0
genuinely happy youre at least trying good luck girl ,0
whats with all the dislikes this was a perfectly rational video let me guess it was people who who dont believe the wage gap exists and were too stupid to understand that the video was in agreeance,0
omg if you believe that  youre dumb,0
peta is one of the worst places to get any of your information from,0
this is the most shallow video of hers ive ever watched and i watched that do dogs have brains video,0
i have been following a plant based diet for the past  days  i am really feeling the benefits long may it continue,0
yes this is what i needed,0
im waiting for trisha to post a video captioned im a tomboy at  am,0
she can be who ever she wants to be as long as shes not hurting herself or anyone let people be and you should know that better then anyone,0
potatoes pasta rice beans nuts and seeds vegetables fruits,0
this might be a bit off topic but i just wanted to say freelee inspired me to go vegan and i have been vegan for about a month now and i kind of got an unexpected result from it i used to get swelling in my face because my kidneys are damaged from recurrent kidney infections but i dont anymore doctors havent been able to help me with that for years since i dont actually have kidney failure but going vegan did its like a miracle,0
yall i loved her video but this sounds like some tucute shit,0
watch other peoples recipe videos or food hauls to get inspiration,0
no no dont tell the truth it does not fit into the rhetoric and the agenda of neofeminists dont do it,0
so youre bored with who you are so now youre gonna just be like okay i wanna be trans thats fun this isnt a fucking game people suffer and struggle every day trying to just be who they are you need to double fucking check your education if you want attention on you be a good person and stop being so damn dramatic,0
this seems a lot less opinionated then most of the facts i hear most other feminists rant about,0
wasnt her last video an unboxing of a leather bag awkward,0
would it not be better and more admirable for these boys to run against boys and compete to win rather than race against girls,1
must be true cause the have graphs and while mothers do more house work  of work related deaths are male you want equality stop being carers and get a dangerous job,0
wheres feminist its wrong we fought for our rights against men for men to do this putting us at bottom again you are fools to say its ok life isnt fairytales and about feelings its about living threw reality good or bad,1
what we have is,0
yay i am so glad for you trish,0
its always the women who are hurt by this kind of stuff,0
give men equal parental rights maybe this would help but wont fit the feminist agenda,0
canbelieve this video is up and real  so uplifting  freelee you bitch please dont call us bitches though thats really disrepectful and shows youngsters that its ok to call a girl thier mother sister a bitch is that really ok from your point of view freellee,1
the wage gap is faker than the moon landing,0
yes there is never married college educated full time working men who have never had children  are paid  less than their female counterparts you need to understand that lefties dont just lie they say the complete opposite of the truth,1
for two week ,0
this is the best add i have ever seen on youtube,0
if these two cheats really want to show their female superiority they should compete in the mens track events or catching the javelin,1
trish also try hummus it comes in plenty different flavors with toast or pita bread and also grilled veggies will fill you up like grilled mushrooms eggplant peppers asperagus zuchini literally any veggies ,0
are there any examples of transgender males excelling in mens sports the only way to make this fair for women is to have all transgender athletes whether they identify as male or female compete in the mens division of their respective sport hormone therapy just hasnt been proven to do enough to even out the advantages that men have over women in sports,1
can everyone be forced to watch this,0
this is great i hope you will stay on the lifestyle,0
beans are the best black beans red beans chick peas lentils any bean is great for protein and they fill you up when i first went vegan i usually ate beans rice and a bunch of veggiesgreens also nuts are a great snack if you just have a big bag of nuts to snack on all day it satisfies your cravings,0
people also miss that there is no proof that the wage gap exists,0
my last  brain cells watching trishs video  those  brain cells when blaires vid comes out wereback,0
trisha and freelee collaboration,0
please dont go vegan,0
here is also the thing a lot of the time when people go vegan they eat a lot of carbs which is what you dont want to do and which is probs what happened when u went vegetarian,0
you are a smart female,0
shes just mad her daughter lost,0
im in the weird part of youtube again wtf,0
would love to hear your thoughts on crossdressers,0
be careful all i saw was you fall and scream be careful girl,0
i went to a seminar on wage negotiation it was mostly geared towards women and i was one of the only two men that showed up they explained that another big issue is that most women dont negotiate their wages where most men will that a lot of women either dont know they can negotiate their pay or dont think their in a position too they did say that some companies have tried to take advantage of that by typically offering a woman less than they would a man on the hopes she wont negotiate it,0
its unconstitutional to require businesses to hire certain people and to pay them a mandated amount,0
why does this video have  dislikes i thought this video was a good one and educational,0
i wonder who would have a problem with donald trump claiming hes a girl and becoming the first girl president anyone can do what they would like but there are guidelines for a reason,0
hey joe get jamie to google vegan dog food bahahahaha,0
this is disgusting as a female track runner im so upset you cant deny the facts that you are a man we will support your change of sex but it doesnt change the fact that you trans are physically stronger,1
try pasta its a great comfort food and a lot of it is vegan try a vegan pesto or butterfake obv lol sauce ,0
and download pinterest and search up vegan recipes ,0
nuts are a great source of protein,0
did that woman say theres quorn in the greggs sos rolls or corn,0

try beyond meat faux chicken and their microwave meals in the frozen aisle at a lot of stores including whole foods ,0
imagine needing soo much attention you sit all day thinking how to offend the whole trans community because she is in such need of male attention and those are her words not mine im absolutely appalled by this video and trisha,1
wow i officially hate you lol,0
if you have a tattoo you can never be a full vegan as your tattoo has traces of animal products in its creation  fact unfortunately all women who got tattoos in early s because all their friends got tattoos so their got one so their didnt feal left out now the exact same groups of friends are now trying to be vegans but they never can be because that tattoo you got that you never wanted in st place means no matter how harecore vegan you try to become that tattoo permanently prevents you from ever becoming a true vegan,0
im just a high school kid you makes youtube videos on gaming i saw this video as an ad and was about to hit skip but man it was so factual and mind blowing that i had to find the actual video and give it a like i was raised to believe the wage gap myth but now your video has shed light on me and brought me into a new perspective on economics i wouldnt have ever been taught that information in school and for whatever reason i was interested in hearing more as she went on nice content i wont sub because its not my style on youtube but its nice to know that theres very interesting things on youtube other than the content i normally digest thanks,0
go carnivoreits only full healthy and good for environment and human dietplant diet sugars oxelytes poisoning you and no nutritional value useless also plant cultivating kills more living creatures in those fields and animals in nature dies  procent or will be eaten by nature preditors before reaching year of age and then when if gets old dies from sickness or will be put down and waisted and only humans can protect them and use and eat them and not waisted  animal dead is natural in nature and tiger or lion wuold eat you if they were hungry vegans are unhealthy and no successful society in the world never existed but let say only meat eaters escimo people are healthy and no vitamin deficiency but vegan kids are undeveloped mentally and physically,1
im not the vegan police but as a side note i hope she remembers not just food by itself will help her lose weight you have to eat balanced while maintaining exercise for permanent results no hate on trisha  shes doing a wonderful thing  i thank her for choosing cruelty free  ,0
i started yesterday st feb a plant based diet wish i had done this years and years ago i feel so sorry guilty and saddened for the animals been one of the most emotional days of my life ,0
i believe it could be that shes been so traumatized by men in her life that she thinks if she becomes one it will fix her pain i also think she might be in love with her gay best friend  shes been known to transform into whatever the guy shes interested wants shes admitted shes very prone to obsessing over things,0
i dont think ur a thick girl or a thick boy i think ur just thick,1

no one gets to be right all the time that being said let us pretend for a minute that a job interview is happening where the choice has not already been made about who will be getting the job long before the first interview was even held because some of the same qualities which men use to get ahead in business are discouraged in women within the business environment women do not have the same bargaining power over wages which men have during an interview for a new job the interviewer does not ever offer up front the maximum amount of money that the business has set aside which they can afford to pay the new employee men can bargain more from a position of strength to get that higher wage because this behavior is acceptable for men if a woman ever wants to be guaranteed she will be paid what is right for her skills education level and qualifications then she has to start her own business ladies christy wright has started a program called business boutique which is all about teaching women how to start and run their own business google her online for more information here is your way to get paid what you want hire who you want and set their wages fairly i hope you compete some of these other businesses right out of business,0
k bigots disliked this video,0
honestly trisha lives off youtube like of course shell make a video saying something outrageous to get views and money like honestly respect for pulling everyone in lol business woman,0
do you hear yourself when you speak,0
excellent video which actually represents facts and figures well done ,0
hello folks from texas,0
i think i read the title wrong,0
despite the actually narrow wage gap between men and women in western industrial societies there is still a tendency of women to call on traditional female privileges where in marriage the male was the sole breadwinner when they say to their spouses whats mine is mine and whats yours is ours it makes a man want to go mgtow men going their own way i could make an exception as christina hoff sommers would make an interesting date,0
boboil butternut squash jalapeo grn onion grn pepper and sweat potatoes puree with coconut milk garlic and vegan cheese put inside large macaroni shells put caramelized onion marinara on top three sprinkle vegan cheese on top and bake,0
if the was white an lossen they ass offwe wouldnt be here lmao,0
i showed this to my feminist classmate to convince her and she just got so pissed at all the points that were made in this video,0
can you just stop making videos thanks ,1
trish but what about the chicken quesadillas,0
trish this is great you dont need to go hungry eat a bowl of pasta or rice and youll food so satisfied most of the stuff you have wont fill you up especially with the amount you have try to get the carbs in dates and bananas are great fruits for that dont be afraid of pasta potatoes noodles etc staying satisfied will help you need on track good luck we are all here for you ,0
if she say so than she is we identify our self not other people,0
seems to be a lot of downvotes for a fairly neutral video on some of the different reasons why the wage gap exists,0
i  i  i ,0
those videos affected you and thats why people should watch them once because they are horrifying but thats the only way people can really see what happens being blind to the facts is just ignorance im really glad youre trying to become veg and i really hope you can make it im vegetarian since i was yo and its the best decision ive ever made besides there are so many veg foods that really taste like the meat ones my family eats meat and they still prefere the veg ones because are just so good i wont tell the name just because im in italy and im sure they wont sell this brand in usa but you just have to find the right ones have a great day everyone d,0
youre setting a terrible example for the trans community outsiders see crazy people like you and think everyone is like that,0
the main reasons theres a wage gap between men and women  women have more paid time off work compared to men when they have children this creates a debt to the companies that pay them  more women leave work or reduce their hours to spend more time in a homemaker role compared to men making it difficult for firms to earn back the extra debt that women create compared to men meaning that women are taxed as a gender to pay back the debt that is created by the entire gender which is also why the wage gap closes towards their later years because they can put more time into work instead of homemaking  men are more competitive and aggressive due to our naturally higher testosterone levels which means men are more likely to take risks apply for the higher paid jobs more productive in highly stressful work environments more likely to have the skills for senior level positions and are wayyy better at asking and negotiating pay rises not saying women cant do these things just a higher proportion of men are capable of it than women,0
its literally factually incorrect,0
trisha i dont like labels also trisha im transgender,0
the documentaries are all one sided viewpoints as a part of the ag industry the processing plants strive for the most humane treatment of the animals dont believe everything you see in the mainstream media i am all of r doing what makes you feel god and healthy but please dont become one of those who tries to push a vegan agenda down everyones throat because of the one documentary you watched,0
doesnt make guys the bad people,0
where is death at workplace gender gap,0
does anyone else have english teachers high school or beyond that push these ideas,0
they cant beat the guys therefore they have to complete against the girls this is unfair y,0
dont be shocked guys this video was recorded on june  come on instagram receipts i see you,0
im turning vegan now lick my ass too,1
sjws and feminists frantically try to decide who to side with,0
unpopular opinion men and women are different,0
i really hope you stick to this and feel better  the environment and animals will thank you,0
feminist get these ideas from joke comments in youtube,0
i like that it was a woman narrerating this video it makes the message stronger,0
there we go guys we found the cure if you dont want a illness then say i dont identify with it and then cured,0
i recommend trying the chashew milk ice cream its so bomb,0
i totally agree with u,0
wtf is wrong with the world ,0
i think shes mentally retarded no kap,1
they dont have to compete against the boys they have to compete in their own category against girls is not fair,1
instead of buying cut packaged fruit buy the whole fruit and eat as much as you want just no oil and you should start losing weight  also get wayyyyy more food once you think you have enough you probably dont get more the more the marrier,0
so she relates to gay men  drag queens,0
i  you freelee,0
old habits die hardfor some they cant do itwhich gives me more respect for those that actually stick to veganism,0
sometimes i go months without watching one your videos then i watch one and i regret the last few months thats all,0
one sentence says it all if u could get away with  wages for women wouldnt u hire just women cant argue with that,0
 feminists disliked this video,0
all the dislikes are from sjws that are pissed cos they realised it is their fault they have no money,0
remember if companies pay women less they would prefer women more it would mean money for the company,0
the only thing worse than sjws are antisjws incoming triggered antisjws,0
for proteins stock up on nuts  beans  green veggies  also for new vegans they have fake meats that taste very real that have protein  make the transition easier if you have any cravings  to make it fun i would look up fun recipes on youtube or pinterest  frozen fruits are really great for snacks and smoothies plus you dont have to worry about them going bad,0
im vegan and i like to eat tons of grains and beans along with my fruits and vegetables and it fills me up and keeps me satisfied throughout the day,0
  there is a word i want to use here but youtube for some ungodly reason seems to continually target me when i use this word and delete my comments when this word is used and its the c word these people are damn stupid inhuman cs of the highest order you can decide to push back but i hope to god that well push back again even fucking harder still alright quite fucking thinking we can be intimidated because we are not shoving dead animals in our faces left right and center you damn heartless devils people when you get this shit thrown at you you must fight that much harder you must help these neanderthal dinosaurs realize that we cant and wont be pushed around or intimidated any longer ok please these bastards are no more right than we are and we cannot allow them to go around thinking they are any longer we simply cant my best be well be safe out,0
  time to open your eyes and mind and see  and go ethical vegan ,0
individual career choices that men or women make or is it that people are mike likely to increase the position and salaries of men than women ,0
if i was a company owner and could pay women  less it would be a total taco fest,0
remember that if you get cravings for meat or dairy there are tons of vegan options vegan junk food yaaassss congrats trisha,0
im with you on trisha not being trans and everything you said related to trans specifically but i dont understand the need to invalidate nonbinary people,0
i dont care what she is but she does look like a failed mutated oompa loompa clone,1
im glad this was demonitised,0
the wage gap actually does take other factors into consideration its an average based on men and women with the same occupation,0
 this man sends quite an unhealthy message out to all meat eaters like me i have given up eating conventionally raised meats from the butcher like hes doing years ago im well into my s an all natural competition bodybuilder for  years and animal protein is the single greatest ingredient to my diet organic grass fed beef is loaded with clas and its proven to improve your health all free roaming animals like elk bison deer provide us witth extremely healthy meats chocked full of those clas heart healthy wild caught fish has no one ever read studies that prove how heathy for your heart it is to eat that this vegan movement is out of control  of the world population is vegan thats under  million people out of  billion total people in the world a tiny flock that squawks mighty loudly its a carcass it has eyes and lungs it has a mother cow farts are going to cause the earth to incinerate this video like all vegan ones is all shock and awe scare tactics and that clear vs cloudy blood in a test tube well played out im confident that my blood isnt cloudy like that implies i eat all of that delicious nutritionally dense food that is presented in all of these vegan videos along with those healthy supporting meats and fish that i mentioned but i make sure to steer clear of every one of those vegan meat substitute processed food junk products good luck standing next to me on stage at my next lifetime all natural bodybuilding competition full of soy products and quinoa and blueberries   its not hard to be thin and really lean like a tennis player or runner but to have the muscle density that i possess at my age you need to be on juice,0
she tells truth,0
i really want to show my mom this video but she would probably hate me for it,0
trisha im sorry but u are not a gay man,0
check out my instagram herbivoreandmore for lots of meal ideas ,0
this is making my brain hurt,0
if only google could see this youre right there is no gender gap in pay,0
i love these vegan annual documentaries thank you so much for this most recent version pbn,0
there was a long time in my life where i thought i was a trans woman and it took years for me to come to the conclusion that im not trans im just a man who likes to feel feminine its okay to be feminine or masculine without being transgender i dont see why everyone feels like it has to be a genderthing for some people it is a genderthing thats great thats what being trans is all about but sometimes it isnt and we dont always have to make it a gender thing just express yourself as you are,0
wait but arent men and women equal,0
what clarity thank you,0
idk y but i think ur mikro wave is really pleasing in your background also great video ,0
chao cheese is really good vegan cheese put other suggestions below,0
that mom is just salty her daughter didnt win,0
rise of an altruistic world,0
i almost forgot vox is a leftwing media thanks for reminding me,0
here in my country we have gay and lesbian athletes that participate in men and womens division respectively and its fine i remember watching a volleyball practice in school mens team and they have  gay players on the team and they are just as athletic and as strong as their male teammates one gay player stands out to the rest of them the whole team he could jump so high and spike that ball so hard i thought it was gonna drill a hole in the ground he was fun to watch,0
if we go by your standards  i guess im trans,0
ok let me get this right girls get man when guys say we are superior than girls but when something like this comes up girls wanna say oh no guys are better than girls at everything,0
well i hope she stays vegan kinda hard to believe that but lets just watch what happens,0
copied from chris does vox realise that its main points disproved the theory of the wage gap completely i tried to sit here for half an hour to collect counter arguments to all your points considering that people in the comments are arguing that people didnt watch the video i managed to cut it down to a few points  your statistics in a few areas only correlated to certain fields of work eg business this creates a misleading argument in the statement you made you also did not reveal the ratio of men  women in the graduate pool so its very difficult to accurately say that men had higher salaries out the gate do you mean on average or in the whole what jobs did they take with what companies this doesnt account for peoples choices out of school argument looked at thousands of men and women who graduated from    men earned more out the gate  its a fact that many years ago women were actively payed less than men for the same jobs its completely ridiculous that you are using arguments from  all the way back to  i mean really  the difference begins shrinking because of pay equality you absolute morons as they approach their s and s was moving into a time where sexism in the workplace was actively being tackled pay was becoming equal so of course the gap closed it really has nothing to do with pregnancy at this point argument  if you look at women born  same thing for women    if you do want to argue pregnancy in a relationship it is two peoples choices to have a child having a child has consequences good and bad you have a child you work less to take care of that child perhaps women do take on a disproportionate share of responsibilities but it is up too the people in the relationship to decide who does what we have maternity leave for a reason for both male and females argument   these statistics dont take into account the actual jobs themselves its illegal to pay women less these statistics and the way you are phrasing them are misleading stop saying the word pay women arent payed less they earn less yearly because of their choices in the job argument   if you dont show up for work or cant work the same hours as a man you are not going to be payed as much i dont care if your pregnant i dont care if you are lazy you dont show up you dont get payed you are contradicting yourself because it sounds like you are saying women have children which force them to have time off but we should make jobs more flexible for them if you choose a job with less flexible hours thats a choice you made society doesnt have too pander to fit your every need argument some jobs require really specific hours not available to her clients when they need her  i could go on but this is boring now your still citing statistics from the s to fit whatever agenda you are pushing in  so congratz if you wanted too prove that the wage gap only happens now because women work less hours you did it women arent paid less than men so too call it a wage gap is totally misleading women get the same salary as man women earn less than men yearly on the whole because of their choices jobs hours etc this entire video was confusing and misleading it sounded like you were saying women are payed less then you were saying they werent but all i took out of it was that in order to shrink the wage gap we need to make jobs more flexable for women the simple answer is no btw i cited every source i could in your video every point i made has your quotes and even the video times you quoted a lot of studies is it that hard too add them too the description,0
 arnold schwarzenegger part,0
is it just mean to think in my head that blair is also just as mental because heshe is transso im basically watching one dellusional person critiquecall out another dellusional person who is to say which one is more sane,1
this trisha thing is pretty damn ugly how can any normal person well we all know that normal people arent in this equation think that this hot stinky mess is attractive and even worth following or even paying any attention to i wonder the kind of person who listens to and takes advice from this wonderfully dumb and woefully ignorant trend setterinfluencer are there that many mentally ill people out there this woman here is a fine example of the pitiful and painfully stupid state that so many young people suffer from nowadays were in a very sad state of affairs if these kids are our future and will be the ones to eventually ruin i mean run this country i would say that i worry for our future but i think that we are well past that right now with all of these bright kids our future doesnt look so bright just sayin,1
trisha says anything everyone thats not how the force works,0
kicking up dust,0
transgender athletic program or coed athletic programproblem solvedthere is a reason why we dont see females who transition go into male dominate sportstransgenders want to be classed as their own gender if they want to separate themselves from biology and anatomy separate them from malefemale sports,1
this is correct very good explanation vox but dont call it a wage gap because its an earnings gap two different things,0
the salary gap is affected by the choices of individuals so we must ask ourselfs what is driving each sex towards specific career paths im not satisfied with the simple awnser that the gender gap just cant be explain and that it simply is there are various factors that can be properly studied social standarscultural customs  companies and countries policies  so maybe in order to explain what drieves people to make certain decitions we have to look at theyre surroundings and see if there is were the problem lies,0
its honestly comforting to see progress being made warms my heart,0
they arent excluded they can run with the boys i hate the argument they will be excluded like running against there biological sex is not an option,1
i dont wear makeup so im a guy insert facepalm,0
im all for equal rights for trans people most definitely like without a doubt but like being born male and having a male teen bodyyou have an athletic advantage your bone structure your muscle density like even after being on e that doesnt change your bone structure and even though they did say that it will replace some lean mass with fat theyre muscle density will still be higher than cis girls id say the say for a trans boy who had been on t for a long period of time that does sports like considering that what most people refer to as steroids is testosterone i dont think thats fair either,0
hopefully she sticks to it,0
i am beyond proud,0
plus we gotta buy dinner,0
omg im so happy for you i was like you were never in my life i and other people would think id be vegan with transitioning you she eat things like fo meat products and then go tewards more healthy fruit and veggies ,0
no trisha none of this makes any sense its offensive and gross that u exploit these topics for views stop it,0
glad to see a left channel acknowledging that the wage gap is a choice by women through the careers they work and their choice to have children rather then systemic sexism where employers intentionally pay women less which believe it or not a lot of leftists and sjws believe,0
vox will make a five and a half minute video to sustain a feminist myth its an earnings gap and notice how they never compare people working the same jobs for the same employers yet youll never see a video about how theres only about an  disparity between men and women in being the recipient domestic abuse which is actually likely much less considering men are far less likely to report not to mention many care facilities for domestic abuse victims will turn male victims away simply on the basis of sex then theres also the rate of male rape victims and female theyre extraordinarily close hardly anyone in the media spotlight talks about that certainly not vox or on the subject of work itself how women have two to one odds to men for being chosen for stem fields in the name of equality plus we have built educational programs to encourage women into fields like physics science and math i can tell you with certainty that men do not receive these support systems also most important of all wage discrimination is made constitutionally illegal by the th amendment and reaffirmed by equal rights of the s also maybe this thing called evolutionary biology puts women in the role of primary cause y know theyre the ones popping out the babies if you want to be seen as a credible news organization vox then tell the full story and maintain some ethics in reporting,0
how can this offensive bs still be online you tube should strike her whole channel please click the three little dots on in the top right and report report this under the violent or repulsive tab,1
gods design and ending is veganism read your bible so in the beginning garden of eden  is the truth the middle is shit and sin and the end is promise of a world without sensless killing and where our true dominion over animals is one of love and play instead of bloodshed wake up to the truth best quote according to th century german philosopher arthur schopenhauer all truth passes through three stages first it is ridiculed second it is violently opposed third it is accepted as selfevident,0
try chickpeas green beans lentils tofutempeh  you can still eat wheat or rice noodlespasta literally any food you normally would but dont add the animal products not the healthiest maybe thats what i do  use random vegspicesfruit to make curries or in soupstir fry x,0
these videos are honestly like the best,0
one of the most factual and also most disliked vox videos ive seen guess the youtube anti sjws cant hear the word wage gap without being triggered into biting everything,0
freelee looked so happy the whole video,0
this is great news new vegan here finally its been a week but im not ever going back keep sharing the message thats most important,0
good luck baby girl you got this ,0
omffff im so proud of you omff i luv you yayy pleasse stay on this its amazing but if you dont that is completely fine youre amazing and just taking this step is amazing so your amazing,0
wooooow gigis face is so masculine,0
it amazes me how people want to do things simply because they can you give an inch they take a foot men and women are not equal the first one that climbs in a boxing ring with mike tyson and knocks him out may start to change my mind,0
so proud of you hun xx but you need o eat some more veggies and lentils too fruit wont really fill you up and you will be shitting all the time if you only eat fruit dahl is like a type of curry made out of lentils its really good also try things like roasted potatoes and pumpkin as well  ,0
do we need to shrink it,0
its absolutely brilliant to see this review of the year i smiled and clapped and gave thanks for all of around the world who are making a positive difference wherever we can to promote vegan to the position as find ourselves in today it too often feels overwhelming to see all the suffering in the world and to feel an impending sense of doom seeing this has improved my mood and renewed my optimism roll on   may the revolution continue,0
offtopic it makes me sad that all the most important jobs like social work and psychology and humanitarian stuff dont pay anything,0
meat production is not destroying the planet factories and transportation do far more harm crop farming does more harm the good news is regenerative livestock and crop farming can sequester carbon back into the soil,0
this is really unfair to the other female athletes,1
all these intelligent economists and they never come out and discuss these things dont they realize their opinion is highly valued why do i only see milo a troll albeit has facts but not an economist argue with dumb feminists i want to see a debate with a phd economist saying there is sexism vs no i probably wont understand most of it but it would be interesting there might not be any economists to even debate one side but thats the thing i dont know their opinions on it so i wouldnt know,0
work hard as men get paid as men,0
so yourea gay manand a bisexual womanand an allyand a drag queensis you ever heard of genderqueer genderfluid,0
looking fwd to that vegan couple doing a video on trish ,0
i went veggie for about months and i was a little over it and tried to eat meat again and i totally couldnt get through my chicken sandwich which is weird i craved meat sometimes and when i allowed myself to go back i couldnt do it lolmeat was just disgusting so i guess its back to being full veggie oxo,0
girl ima do this with you  ,0
lmao  i thought this is what woman wanted equality for all right you cant have it both ways,0
praise this lady,0
i identify as billie eilish my pronouns areduh i support transgender people as im trans myself,0
i am vegan but the apocalyptic introduction to the film turned me off immediately scare tactics are not the way to change the world,0
im so confused what is going on i,0
in what jobs women earn more money than man there must be some,0
i predict this video to go viral offend everyone because its  every views seeking commentator will make a video on it then shell delete it i know internet too damn well,0
should be in therapy why are we forced to accept someones delusions,1
the first  seconds of this video is fucking iconic,0
you go girl my biggest tip for you would be to remember that there is not only one way to eat as a vegan the way freelee and many of the vegans in the youtube vegan community eat is amazing and super healthy but if its not interesting to you then dont forget that you can literally eat anything so long as its vegan oreos dairy free ben and jerrys basically any vegan junk  obviously thats pretty unhealthy to live off but my point is  just remember you dont have to restrict or deprive yourself of things you love if you feel like having some cookies or ice cream then why not  whatever keeps you vegan girl if you nourish yourself with staples like rice curries pastas potatoes etc chances are you wont even crave junk anyway  good luck,0
there is no gender wage gap anymore,0
thank you for being awesome vox i try my best to avoid watching channels that seem too biased in either direction and so in the past have often avoided yalls videos but more and more i have found that whenever i do go and watch a video of yours i find it to show the full story pretty much everytime sorry i ever doubted ya,0
thats bollocks gender wage gap is a reality ,0
i meanshe also came out as a chicken nugget,1
pump the girls up with testosterone ,0
because men are better workers than women its simply hard for a women to accept  ,1
god i found watching her terrible presenting hard worst autocue reader ever hope she got paid less that someone who could do it properly,0
so this proves you get paid for the work you do and the wag gap is bs good video,0
i just cant follow im just confused i love trisha and i just hope she can figure her brain out,0
blair white reacting to trisha paytas while eating chickfila after the lgbt community protested chickfila in canada is gold,0
theres also vegan chips cookies etc,0
i feel like this is literally representative of the entire nonbinary movement i sincerely hope that this is a joke and shes doing it satirically to point out the fact that fashion is not the same as gender lol but whether she meant to or not thats what she did for any person capable of logical coherent thought love you blaire ,0
any vegan haters please respond im waiting to roast you,0
theres not a wage gap theres an earning gap women earn less cause they work less take more vacation take off due to children etc,0
i think going vegan is a great idea but you should consider taking supplements there are many nutrients you cant receive while vegan btw love you and your vids,0
shes gonna be like the hottest vegan ever,0
i quit watching and supporting trisha a long time ago she is nothing but a drama queen and an attention whore,1
i decided to go vegan just over a month ago and for the most part am doing ok with it i still struggle with work lunches but am adding to my recipes all the time im doing this for the animals the environment and my health been diabetic for  years i started with just one recipe homemade falafel with veganaise i then replaced my usual bacon and egg breakfast burrito with overnight oats its amazing my sugar used to go through the roof just eating oatmeal with skim milk and sugar now i can have oatmeal with bananas blueberries sugar cashew milk and chia seeds my sugar actually decreases a bit its a freaking miracle i only just tried the date and banana smoothie a week ago it was only two bananas and  dates but i couldnt finish it this girl who is  lbs and could eat  large donairs couldnt finish a smoothie despite the razzing from family and a husband who refuses to believe that eating meat is bad for you or the environment im sticking with it im not the healthiest vegan yet but im sure that will come side note also decided to start studying buddhism why not,0
the only reason to go vegan is for health reasons everything else is foolishness,1
im on month  ill subscribe to you for two weeks if you stay vegan ill stay subscribed deal good luck girl ,0
no way omg im so happy  yass trisha,0
freelee and others  lets remember one thing  she might slip up and thats okay  if she does keep her encouraged instead of attacking her and putting on to much pressure,0
they are just boys wearing weave and makeup not female track stars,1
although im a total left winger i enjoy listening to prageru because at least they say it in an intelligent way and it forces me to develop a smarter rebuttal if i cant then i tend to agree with it the problem with people now days is that people only listen to what they want to hear and become very polarized i recommend watching vox videos if you are willing to do the same as me im sure right wing media makes the left wing sound stupid and vise versa but you look at educated thoughts on both sides neither sound as stupid,0
i reaaallllyyy want to go vegan but idk how because none of my family is vegan and im not exactly old enough to buy my own groceries yet i suggested it to my mom and she wasnt exactly open to the idea because it was an expensive diet any suggestions or ideas,0
or if u wantb a mother u cld b a mother  ,0
what i love about blaire is that i can scroll randomly through her videos with my eyes closed and click on anything and be entertained theres not many youtubers i can do that with,0
vegans need to understand the difference between factory farming and sustainable regenerative farming how many studies need to show a net positive on the environment from sustainable farming need to come out before vegans understand this i guess the lack of fats in their diets are harming brain function idk,0
i went vegan for about a month and a half but it had a complete opposite affect on me i started breaking out like crazy and i never had energy i made sure that i was having enough calories and nutrients but for some reason my body was completely rejecting it has this happened to anyone else if so has anyone found out why,0
these comments are disgusting,0
 its because you gotta do another collab video,0
im so glad for you i hope everything goes amazing,0
yay positivity i love positivity i love this video,0
trisha just says words i dont think she understands them or knows what they mean she just speaks,1
freelee and kalel have really good recipes also email jenna she has some great veggie based stews random suggestions steel cut oats diced apples chopped almonds cinnamon almond milk maple sugar watermelon i fucking love watermelon and its high water content helps keep you hydrated and help with the digestion of excess fiber avocado kale almond milk vanilla extract banana shake oranges in the morning to slap yo face with some vitamin c lots of cardiocalisthenics walking is totally fine stay hydrated to aid digestion avoid caffeine whole foods has this honey made from apples forgot the company name they were on shark tank chipotle has some great options careful though some stores have issues with cross contamination of vegan and non vegan products  julienned sauted green peppers and red onions with some soy oil oregano and kosher salt will change your life fajita peppers put that over some rice with cumin bay leaves and a squeeze of lime,0
so i came across this term  which i had to look up transmasculine it refers to a cis female who expresses herself with traits normaly considered maleish so im personally not sure if this is a legitimate nonbinary gender but if it is considered to be and nonbinary is included under the umbrella transgender or is it the other way around  then this trish certainly has a legitimate case for being transgender,0
its not surprising this obvious propaganda works on braindeads the culling will be swift and without mercy,0
does anyone know what happened to freelees instagram,0
i dont care what she said in that video but if you or anyone else say that trisha isnt trans that is horrible we dont know what is in her mind you of all people what if i told you no you are not trans nope you need mental help,0
why do they have to eat around the bush why cant they just say it is due to flexbility of the hours they kepts getting me lost,0
bruh isnt this when she did  becoming shane dawson vid lmao,0
so basically its not all about a gender gap in pay thats the problem its flexibility gap between genders that causes the phantom gap in gender pay interedasting thanks i will distribute this message around,0
check out  they have bomb vegan recipies,0
i commented once before and its going to sound like im saying this hostile and im not at all but you telling her how this works how a transgender should be where you have stated in a past video you still have your penis and what have you down there because you would mourn the loss so does that mean youre not fully transgender you still want to hold on to some male parts because you would mourn the loss so obviously you dont know exactly how it works either i dont either but apparently its still open for debate what transgender is and what it isnt and how many genders there are so again not with any animus at all here but who gives you the right to say shes not doing it right and youre doing it right not a hater just wondering why you feel youre an expert at it because you have a lot of followers would love to hear a true answer and not somebody cussing me out you want to be accepted like everyone else and be a normal person i got it but here youre squashing someone else who obviously is got issues and isnt dealing with it well but at least trying to express it i dont think you should be jumping down on a lost soul what gives you the right to say  what the fuck thats not how it works  ,0
people who still support that kind of cruelty have no soul glad to see people are waking up,0
its crazy because no one is mad about them being transgender its simply not fair that they are running with biological girls period its nothing personal,1
eat as much as you want of the right foods  brown rice potatoes some pasta sweet potatoes veggies fruit bananas and dates lentils beans avocado eat whats going to be satisfying easy and convenient for you ,0
i never find obviously gay men hot ive had coworkers or class mates think theyre hot but i dont cant explain it,0
freelee is so sweet and seems so happy hopefully trisha doesnt disappoint,0
youre going to feel sooooo much better cleaner if youre just transitioning you can eat more processed foods that you would normally eat just vegan ,0
maybe because men are going out of their way to work constantly and goes to work despite being hurt or sick theyre natural leaders and theyre always trying to do the best women have the potential they just dont go for the job that men go for,0
im going to cry am so happy omg i love you trishaw for doing this subbing again,0
thats amazing trish  freelee does a raw til  diet so she eats tons of raw fruits and veggies for breakfast and lunch and does light exercise and then eats a cooked dinner after  you can eat as many fruits and veggies as you want but beware of vegan junk food try to not eat after  and hydrate some meat and dairy alternatives to eat in moderation that are amazing are chao cheese gardein chicken and almost anything from starbucks without whipped cream java chips and with soy or coconut milk as a substitute i love you trishy and im so psyched youre joining the vegan family keep up your fiber and protein rice and beans for days smash in the fruit girl i hope you love your two week vegan experience and it becomes a longterm thing its not a diet its a lifestyle but it also doesnt have to take over your life ,0
sensitive its not fair for the girls of course its not fair they are men going against women its just like the mma fighter fighting women they are men you cant even compare that shit is fucked up,1
oh a vegan b supplement i recommend that actually tastes decent is from natural health goodies you can buy them on amazon highly recommend so you dont crash they are small chewable and arent nasty if you are like me and are worried about getting enough vitamins and minerals we arent all perfect vegans deva makes a good multivitamin that is quite tiny and easy to swallow again you can get them on amazon dont forget to drink tons of water d,0
thw wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women full time it does not count for different job positions hours worked and sick days it has nothing to do with the same job or discrimination,0
chickfila the antilgbt company is there no popeyes near you good critique of this person,0
lol gender wage gap is fake because if women got payed less than men for the same job theyd fire all the men,0
male logic translation women make choices that affect their income negatively while men do whatever it takes to clime the corporate ladder the wage gap is a myth here is proof if you are a ceo and you can hire women at  cents on the hour to the dollar an hour a man works for the same output in labor who will you hire if you want to get rich the answer will always be the woman since she is cheaper labor that is simple economics folks the reason that woman are not dominating the workforce because of this logical choice is because they make decisions that adversely affect their work performance taking time off to raise kids and inflexible schedules is bad for business so you make less for those reasons ladies no man is oppressing you you did it to yourselves so maybe quit blaming your bad choices on men ok also just so we are clear paying a woman less for the same work is discrimination and there are laws against it since you never hear of women winning lawsuits then these companies obviously are not in violation of said law so your wage gap argument is invalid,0
anybody with any common sense knows these girly men do have an advantage sorry to burst your bubbles but they were men first and girly men second,1
stupid ass thats all i gotta say,1
why did you post this video knowing its old  you didnt stick with being vegan,0
the wage job does not exist,0
theres probably so many fake npcs in this chat saying that the gender pay gap is real,0
you can still have fraps trish but with soy or coconut milk d,0
men are faster than women they are biological males period,1
merch idea how bout you just be you dude someone needed to say that finally,0
i heard you failed but to let you know you can eat beans rice pasta burritos vegan cupcakes pancakes veggie burgers vegan cheese so good except daiya i dont like it personally but you might literally for every meat there is a vegan substitute for it however dont eat mock meats like tofu everyday because it is somewhat processed and its better to steer clear every now and then quinoa and beans have protein and fiber theirs lentils and so much more,0
feminists be like i work  hours less than a coal miner as a babysitter therefore we should get paid the same well russia communism has finnaly made its way over i believe,0
but isnt the question why is there a gender gap in the number of people pursuing certain careers,0
what is in her lips gross blaire much more a women than that women i love chick f awesome,0
so why is it that both of my parents work at the same job both came in at the same week and my dad got more thats weird when you compare it to the video hmmmmmmmmm,0
i really want to be vegan but im really scared of gaining weight even if it is only at first im really scared of fair gaining weight im already vegetarian help,0
being vegan for  and a half years best years of my life never turn back lets save our planet thank you for such a great film,0
its a pay gap not a wage gap,0
so what i learned from this video is that we men are assholes we dont want to go into social work environmental work helping people dealing with kids ext,0
 sounds like russell brand,0
dumbass bitch i dont usually get offended with my gender identity but saying nonbinary is plural wtf i identify as they them nonbinary and thats fucking stupid youre not trans liking gay guys and being female is a normal thing  also why the fuck would you get surgery to enhance your feminine features if your trans ,1
how can there be a gender wage gap if gender is a social construct,0
female body builders still wear super effeminate clothing and makeup even though people would say not me to be clear they look like men top beauty gurus and makeup artists out here are men were at the precipice of stopping conformity purely by gendersexuality and then trisha has to sit on her kitchen floor and talk a load on nonsense because she cant be bothered to take her money and go see a therapist to work all that out,1
i am so proud of you trishy without the fishy,0
im so mad i could eat my shoe,0
you need to get your protein in either by vegetables or protein shake without any dairy in it also a b supplement if you dont you can get a major headache and feel like crap,0
you can choose to be any gender you want on any given day lol she is setting society back with this idiotic thinking,0
if i went vegan i would do it in a way that a lot of vegans dont do itthey eat vegan burgerssteaklunch meat why go vegan if youre eating imitation meat shiteat stuff that like is just obviously veganlearn to love them veggies man lol,0
not a gay man,0
i feel terrible for her she looks like shes losing it ,0
 please fix your layout,0
i told a femenist that why dont companies hire only women and she said that there are is this true what should i say,0
try gardien fishless and chikin products,0
thank you for this excellent video i became a vegetarian over  years ago because i thought it was the healthiest way to eat i became a vegan a little over  years ago because i did not want to contribute to animal suffering then i found out that a vegan diet is the best diet for the environment i am  years old  i do not take any prescription drugs i do take vitamin b i am still a working productive member of society i live with gratitude for the beauty  abundance of nature  for the benefits of a plant based diet eat your fruits  veggies,0
she used the title transgender and got away with it by saying im a gay man who is also a drag queen so she is essentially a straight girl that likes guys and likes to get glam whenever she wants to or just to bum it in sweats lol she is so full of shit,0
 gigi girl what are you doing that hat and scarf tho ,0
poor trish shes gonna get so much hate when she posts a video of herself eating meat,0
why is there a wage gap at all simple women make decisions that man cannot do women get pregnant men dont so they can continue to work unimpeded for the next  months even if they dont get pregnant women overall have more health concerns that take them away from work and another reason men make more is because various jobs often tend to use money to incentivize people to take them its why men dominate the careers that tend to expose oneself to unsanitary filthy disgusting conditions the most dangerous jobs in the nation are overwhelmingly male,0
finally im so happy,0
why do those on the right hate the idea of equal rights that includes hating feminism there is a gender wage gap even this video has to admit it,0
prageru is part of the misogynist patriarchy,0
theres a clever linguistics trick at around  she says the wage gap shrinks when we account for choice and then says the remaining  is due to choice that doesnt actually logically follow and the fact that such a blatant error made it through scripting performing and editing says that it was likely deliberate,0
it seems the two sides are talking past each other again even after explaining why the gender gap is there is clearly still a conversation to be had why is this the case that women are making these choices to be less prosperous then men and what role socialization has to do with it this problem however is a whole different problem from the original idea of women being paid less for the same work and has different implications still running back to the  wage gap buzzphrase is irresponsible and really the words coming out of peoples mouths should be more something along the lines of women are living less prosperously and ambitiously then men what could the implications of this be,0
the wage gap is what we call a myth,0
as a trans person i find this disrespectful tbh,0
i personally connect with some of what that chick is saying though calling herself trans no its like she is rubbing the fact shw is born the gender she identifies as in the faces of every trans person basically luaghing at their struggle i share some of the same feelings she mentions i often fantasize about being male however i am happy with my gender so no way can i call myself trans that chick definitely trolling or she really believes she is if the latter she has some unknown issue that hasnt been discovered and given a name yet,0
it really is a simple issues genetically they are males no matter how they feel or think they feel the science say they are if you have to get your prostate checked at  then you are still male bottom line i dont understand where the confusion lye in this situations those two should not be competing with girls,1
oh my god girl the first  seconds had me dead ,0
try gardien they sell it at targetwhole foods and walmart and probably lots more places all their products are awesome,0
so trisha what is your gender and sexual orientation trisha yes,0
freelee i have a question how does it feel to be the coolest vegan ever,0
its not a wage gap its an earnings gap,0
this is what antifeminists have been saying all along the earnings gap exists because women choose lower paying fields and work fewer hours than men it has nothing to do with discrimination it has nothing to do with sexism if a woman chooses to have children it will hurt her earnings potential that is just a fact of life women are free to make this choice no one is forcing it upon them,0
unfortunately trisha is being a troll im so confused how people still even find her relevant this is exactly what she wanted everyone to do she has admitted so many times that she says these things to be a troll and have people make these videos and certainly not saying you shouldnt have bc i love all of your videos im just glad you uploaded anything lmao but i wish people would stop giving her what she wants so she can just sink into her vile little hole shes not a good person imo,1
trish here is my favorite recipe and its super easy and vegan and now on sodium what youll need tortilla bread mushrooms corn tomato avocado yellow bellpepper fry the mushrooms in vegan butter or oil cut the ingredients up and put them in the tortilla bread close it fry the tortilla bread d done,0
only commies believe in the gender wage gap myth,0
you can get frapps from starbucks with soy or almond milk instead,0
the act be like solve this,0
i laughed so hard when u said u r sitting on ur kitchen floor ,0
i love when people say that science cant define things that we can see with our own eyes at one point in our development we used the word blue to describe the sky way before anyone understood how light and colors actually existed,0
im weak as shit lmao,0
you see what they do that anouncer keeps saying that the problem is him being transgender but thats not true i dont give a dam if you feel like being a fucking frob and suck dick all day long what matters is when you start to cheat your way to succes,1
peanut butter without sugar and salt is good protein and vegan look for the vegan slogan on the jar im not vegan myself but i prefer the healthier peanut butter option you can make this smoothie which i think literally taste like chocolate just a bit anyways you need spinach coconut water banana peanut butter and optional boosting powder which mine is vegan but cant remember name,0
mrs sommers you should be louder because we need someone loud about this nice to see my dear pennsylvania has professors who can see actual facts i plan to move to the us next year to study there im  years ahead i got everything ready except for the immigration papers we decided to pay full tuition despite the fact that i could have tried for scolarship because we thought it would make immigration easier it didnt we still got until mid  to figure this out so not very worrisome at the moment but still i wish we could get all that paperwork behind as soon as possible,0
meet trisha a gay man,0
all of a sudden theres  genders when it comes to money please dont assume my gender btw i openly identify as a lawnmower not a male,0
does she realize how offensive this is to gigi one of her best friends on the platform who is actually transgender like please sit down and do your research before blabbing on the internet for attention thats all this is its just for attention so just report the video and move on,0
game changers really changed my view of veganism and having a more plant based diet hopefully ill slowly transition to a more plant over red meat diet i tried watching the doc dominion too but it was so disgusting and horrible i couldnt take it in a way the meat industry takes money from people without them knowing that it will heighten cholesterol worsen their heart condition and more thank you vegans for doing what you are doing hopefully i can join you guys this year so sick of red meat,0
finally feminists are actually addressing this issue,0
 a gay man   what,0
what people miss about the gender wage gap white women make much closer salary to men while latina and black women make much much lower on the dollar and asian women usually make close to or higher than white women any discussion of the gender pay gap that ignores race is incomplete at best,0
hey girl im vegan please email me or reply to this comment if you need help ,0
but theres no such thing as the wage gap,0
my freeleefuckingbananagirl youtube video routine  dislike  report her fucking video for fucking pornographic content enjoy the video and eat a fucking tasty steak muhahahaha,1
she cant do it,0
trump commercial was b your vid,0
sounds like we need to pay certain occupations more like teachers,0
ah so its an earnings gap then,0
     guys what is up,0
the meat and dairy industrys are running scared brilliant to see,0
the liberal left will use any example of unfairness in society and announce themselves as the answer to the problem and the saviors of the disadvantaged  all to achieve political power,0
blaire  as always  u nailed it and u did with class  and class is something trish is lacking among rapidly loosing brain functions  love from canada,1
use pinterest for sure you can find all kinds of things there try veggie  bean burgers bean burritos zucchini chips baked make sure you use brown rice and not white oh cauliflower with hot sauce recipe makes it taste like chicken  but not  cauliflower is also good to use for bread pizza mash potatoes  and the list goes on  good luck with it all god bless,0
i hate vox but this is probably their most unbiased video ever made so i will give it it a like in my mind a real like hell no,0
this is so interesting i never thought of breaking it down like this,0
bunch of freaks,1
let them compete in the mens competition oh my gosh i said mens how bigoted of me,0
i am so glad this was made,0
oh trish im so hapy you are trying to be healthy and not crash diet again try clean carbs low fat low sodium especially because sodium is what make us bloat af so you can go and look flawless on that video i love that you are going vegan try recipes from the vegan corner they are awesome i hope you enjoy this  weeks,0
whats sad is it doesnt matter how many times we explain this the idiots who believe women are paid less will ignore the facts,0
theres vegan frozen food and its pretty good like meatless nuggets and meatballs good for you eating disorders are not good and makes you gain more weight after you diet good luck,0
they arent at an advantage cause if theyre taking hormones then they are weaker testosterone makes you stronger and estrogen makes you weaker so skksksksksksksk,0
the female wr record in  meter by a juiced florence griffithjoyner is  no woman has even been close to beating that record in more than  years male football players run faster than griffithjoyner this debate is a joke,0
this is truly the end of time,0
no offense but you are too weak when you are just saying you going vegan for just  weeks if i see all of your thumbnails i see animal products and beauty productsyou will still stay overweight if you dont cut the fat and especially the animal products ,0
if all people switch to plant food then farmers will not have time to grow plants in a natural way i think this is already happening and they will start using any chemicals to achieve a result and this will not have the best effect on peoples health all this fast food is like beggar food why fake meat study the diet of longlivers of the planet they never ate food from stores because it is impossible to sell food without preservatives because it will not be profitable,0
someone send this to amy schumer,0
this video surpassed my expectations,0
this is so dumb ,0
if a woman works just as much as her husband and is still doing mostall of the housework then its on her to tell her husband that she needs more help from him that sounds like a relationship issue not a pay gap issue,0
i dont like pink trish i want u to step into my pink jeep and come to my house so i can show u my house thats totally not full of pink i just realized she doesnt have a jeep she has a gwagon god fucking dammit,0
women take more responsibility for child bearing because they have more of a natural instinct for it this is such feminist bullshit also hate this woman presenting the video annoying voice and pissy attitude poor video vox,1
for every  dollar a man makes a woman makes  quarters,0
i expected a slimy biased video of misconceptions false information and lies this actually was pretty good,0
yes trisha im so excited for you the tips that i have are definitely get in those fruits ands veg  they contain mostly water and they are low calorie so you can eat a lot of them and feel full for a longer amount of time but dont for get about your rice and potatoes to get protein i would recommend lentils chick peas tofu you can season and cook it all sorts of ways oh and you need to try nice cream its a must all that it is is bananas and non dairy milk just put  bananas in a food processor with a splash of milk and blend it up my last tip you just to look on youtube and the internet search for vegan meal inspo hot for food is a great channel to look at and if youre scared of gaining weight just really listen to your body eat when youre hungry and then dont over eat and make sure its still clean foods i hope this helps i know its a little rambley,0
most of my crushes where women so does that mean im a straight guy by trishas logic,0
youre honestly a disgusting person you forced her by being obsessed with her and talking about her in almost every video ,1
i love this video i love the speaker i love it all,0
spaghetti and vegetables is my fav,0
i was correct old video from two weeks ago in her latest snapchat story she ate chicken and waffles dominos  a bunch of other stuff shes not vegan,0
reason lol bc she fat,1
nope they are gay boys,0
what the hell just what the hell,0
yall dudes your going to have an advantage,1
government lets make sexual offense a crime only if women are the victims women starts pointing to all existing football players around the world,0
i cant believe it this is amazing,0
those there are a men with full grown dingalongs rested between two ball sacks mustaches growing wild as hell muscles as defined as they can get voice bout as low as possible prove me wrong,0
we live in a society,0
its funny that our economy seems to favour less the jobs that women tend to take in what ways is a loan shark more useful to society than a nurse why are footbal players more valued than kindergarden teachers why are engineers which are very important dont misunderstand me paid much more than home health aides those are vital and immeasurably important positions yet most of these people struggle with income while bankers laugh away their problems with other peoples money,0
goddamn you even eat chickfila fabulously,0
this video is confusing to say the least but what she says makes some sense if we look at this from a crossdreamer perspective a lot of trans people live and present as their assigned gender even if their real identity is trans or nonbinary there are good and bad reasons for why they do so but the fact that they are not transitioning does not make them less trans her frustration of being a gay man in a womans body reflects the kind of pain many nontransitioning trans people feel i guess some will dismiss the whole idea as preposterous given her extreme femme appearance but many trans people make desperate attempts at living up to the stereotypes trying to fit in kirsten beck was a bearded navy seal fighting in afghanistan before she gave up fighting herself moreover characteristics like femme and butch are not restricted to one gender after all these were terms created in the lesbian community i dont know if trisha is trans but she deserves the chance to find out for herself,0
v e g a n spoken with baku voice and v e r y distorted this comment section is boring i expected some funny comments and jokes about vegans i am dissapointed,0
male competing with females thats shameful they cant win against guys so they compete with girls losers,1
so  im aaa  man ,0
why do women choose such horribly paying occupationsstrange,0
she keep talking but all i hear is stupidity,1
try making noodle stir frys rice pasta with tomatobased sauces and other carby things because to maintain a fully raw all fruit and veggie diet you have to eat sooo much to start off you should try eating meals like the above to transition so it doesnt feel like a shock if you go coldturkey raw i guarantee you wont stay vegan ,0
this bitch really used her zac efron in the thumbnail lmao ahhhhhhh,0
can you please teach me how to stay vegan in japan,0
ok great but please stop dr eric berg do something more drastic,0
i should be happy after watching this because veganism is spreading faster and faster  but i am not because there are so many nobrainers in the world i got a headache when i saw those raw meat imbeciles ive been vegan for  months i know not that long but people like them still break my heart ,0
i think this is the first video ive ever disliked,0
tbh im here for this lol,0
that ending this lady is a savage,0
im quite confused why would sjws get so bitchy when it is proven that the wage gap doesnt exist i know that most of them are whining like children about their other problems but i dont see the need to be whiny when proven that the discrimination of pay didnt exist,1
yay i just went vegan a week ago congrats,0
i thought i was trans turns out just really gayand misslead im crossdresser now but thats it,0
actually its all women and all men including those that dont work it also doesnt factor in anything from maternal leave to hours worked to length of career the study is just a statistic of what every woman in the us earns averaged out vs what ever man in the us earns averaged out including those that make billions and those that dont earn a nickle factoring those in tends to result in a lot of fields where women are payed vastly more than men perhour,0
who is the comedian ,0
idk if theres anything trisha could do to make me dislike her haha ,0
im not even trans and shes not making any sense to me i can only imagine how actual trans people are sitting there watching her and just going what the hell,0
if there was a gender wage gap all businesses would be hiring women only they would cost less,0
women choose to be pediatricians instead of surgeons,0
cheating these girls out of a future two grown ass men if you born a man u always will be a man,0
wait wait wait at the end you were saying with jobs with more flexiable hours the pay gap is less but why,0
the kitchen floor the chickfila the mourning of braincells blaire i fucking love you,0
absolutely amazing film what a year to be vegan cant wait to see what next year brings ,0
i am a vegetarian going vegan because of you freelee baby steps baby steps thank you so much i am exited for my new and healthy life style i used to not agree with you and hate you but now i love you so much and i realized your message to people and i love your message i am extremely sorry for me hate comment on one of your videos i dont remember which video it was though thank you sooooooooooo much,0
freelee is such a beautiful person inside and out all she wants to do is help this world,0
so basically women arent paid less rather they work less hours and therefore earn less than someone who can work more hours seems fair enough  why does this need changing,0
i really like the last sentence u dont have to like u have to hear me ccuz sometimes i do like and sometimes i dont but its abot the message so it doesnt matter,0
good for you trish i wish u all the very best in this dont stress if u slip up cos its all part of the change u will master it in no time im sure and will have a tone of energy too and feel great also ive been vegan for   years now and am the healthiest ive ever been i never get sick and i caught a cold early this winter cos its winter in aus and it was like nothing and only lasted about a week anyway i make pizzas sushi pasta dishes rice dishes and chips and loads of fruit i havent missed dairy or junk in ages lfhc is the trcik as freelee has probably told u already but yeah just love rt its awesome dont be scared about the as many calories as you want thing it works,0
progressives purposely leave that information out to push their narrative of the war on women which there is no war on women,0
nah u both guys gtfo,1
sad as hell,0
all you and freelee do is throw shade at each other and now you love her,0
so if transgenderism has nothing at all to do with sexstereotypes aka gender which is literally centred around the concepts of man  masculine and woman  feminine then why cant trish be a trans man who enjoys the sexstereotype of femininity why should she cut her hair males can have long hair right why should any trans people do anything at all to their appearance in order to align with the sexstereotype of the sex they identify as make it make sense,0
overtime weekends afterhour calls hazard pay flex time negotiating pay raises desire for pay raises over gaining benefits,0
i want to go vegan but idk how to tell my parents,0
you can do it trish potatoes rice dominos vegan pizza chao cheese perfect for grilled cheeses and sandwiches you can have everything you want dont limit yourself to just fruits or you will screw up eat cookies and salads anything do your research it girl,0
listen to the distant screeches of the special snowflakes as they sprint here as fast as their chubby legs can carry them,0
this is actually a gender gap because those numbers reveal that women in general tend to have a lower position than men in a work place women earn less even with a proper education and the same performance as their male colleagues,0
one more comment female dominated jobs seem to reflect females natural abilities as a result of having babies unfortunately when a couple ie a male and a female decides to have children it is usually the females job that is sacrificed why because the males job pays more was it the females choice alone to have children so why does it always seem the female takes the hit careerwise,0
i dont get what she means when she first says that when you account for different choices women and men make the wage gap shinks to  c and than she says that this gap that does exist is again due to differnt choices that doesnt really make sence does it,0
 why is science so far into the left i thought science related jobs had good pay,0
im very much about bbs and i love showing them off im sorry no trans man would ever say that i know tons of fem trans guys but none of them would use that word to talk about their chest i used to love trish but this is wild love you review sex toys in lingerie but the fact that you talk about all of the ftm partners you have had makes it sound like its just sexualized to you or a fetish this is seriously going to do more damage to the trans community than jonathan yaniv the you can be whatever gender you want comment especially pissed me off because that makes trans seem like a choice nobody would choose that i dont want anyone thinking that i think this because she is feminine but the fact that she always has her chest out and id very confident about her body body positivity is awesome but no trans man would do that okay this rant is over im sorry it was all over the place though nobody is gonna read this far lol,0
so fucking proud of you you bamf,0
i dont really think there is a wage gap in the way people think i think men earn their increased pay compared to a woman unless its an exceptional case of a boss or manager who is truly sexist butthere is a deeper problem women are led to believe they are weaker too emotional and too volatile all their lives women dont just compete against men but they also compete against women lots of women in power seem to see themselves as an exception and supporting another woman is threatening to their perceived special position as a woman so the wage gap ends up being because women are not striving as high as men but a lot of it is because of psychological manipulation to believe they arent good enough,0
notification squad where you at ,0
i am a proud lean vegan machine ,0
did anyone in this comments section actually watch the video lmao,0
theres an earnings gap not a wage gap,0
real girls are going to lose out on scholarships because boys are competing how selfish,1
yay trish yay,0
i dont believe youre trans sounds genderfluid to me,0
some of my faves are lentil sloppy joes lentil tacos white bean enchiladas with avocado sauce anything from miyokos cook books oat meals great,0
so  of the american adolescent population is transgender interesting,0
so she made  just from this video,0
if i had a dollar for every gender there was id have ,0
love your attitude freelee,0
august   the day i became vegan havent gone back since ,0
according to the broadcast why is womens soccer so white one of the main reasons for it is that that these youth players are preferring to play for clubs rather than just to play high school soccer they see the need to play for clubs because since the womens soccer is not as major as for the mens soccer team despite of how well they perform as compared to the men it was mentioned that some clubs were as high as  per teenage girl when we compare national team clubs to high school soccer it is notable that not everyone will have that type of money to pay for their girls to go off to play it all has to do with socioeconomic and the parents who have this type of money due to their higher incomes are white thus this is one big reason why there is so little diversity in the womens soccer team shifting to the video there is no gender gap the overall message is that there is only a  wage gap and not more as others make it seem they mention how basically it is the womens fault because of their career options which impacts how much money they make however what they dont realize is that out of all the job options they have there is only  of jobs that pay women and men equal so how are they expected to choose wisely when there is hardly any options for them to choose from it is sad to see how even with the same education the gap still remains just because women are seen as less reliant because they are not able to work at all times due to motherhood and all the other household responsibilities women have on top of work they mention how it is not sexism but all of the previous states otherwise how men are more capable of doing certain jobs and they are less of a burden for employers moreover according to adams et al of section  classism womens average pay is at  of mens compensation throughout their whole career women only make  of what men make it was mentioned in the reading how discrimination is part of it but also because women are not always able to work the full time and thus if you need to be absent for a period of time from work it is a stiff penalty in declining their career and slashing the pay the lack of daycare and flexible job options makes it really hard for a woman to work the same amount of hours as a man overall i think it is important to analyze this further and note how it is not that they are not telling us the truth or they are doing bad math they are sharing the actual facts and truth on what women have to deal with,0
i stopped eating meat  years ago and i dropped  pounds in a month i didnt starve myself or exercise like crazy it just fell off of me i went vegan over a month ago and suddenly my skinny jeans are now to big on me lol,0
i dont know when she recorded this but id assume longer than a day ago and on her sc she was eating chips and drinking soda less than  hrs ago,0
took notes so i can debunk my political class teacher on this,0
sounds like a more realistic reason then just sexism like the left says it is,0
so the wage gap exists because of life choices makes sense if i work more on call more and am willing to relocate further,0
if you still like junk food you can still have it just make sure its vegan and make sure youre eating enough,0
facts with statistics,0
okay so lets wait for the day she says shes black,0
it really doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things just be you you dont need to convince anyone or explain yourself just be you and be with the people that bring out your true self instead of everyone being offended put yourself in someone elses shoes and try feeling what it is they are saying love do not judge,0
its not fair that boys compete against girls but tbh all this back lash started because looser parents got salty,1
smashed that like button so hard it broke,0
if u dont want to cut out dairy a good way to get rid of a huge pimple is to rub ice on it and then put some eye drops that are for red itchy eyes on it and the ice will make the puffiness go down and the eyedrops get rid of the redness this is a life saver cause on the day of my choir concert i was singing a huge solo and i got a pimple i used this trick and it went away,0
a few minutes worth of research proves that this video essay is inaccurate,0
there is no war in ba sing se,0
no offense but la people always say im not a gender i dont put labels on stuff let me check my twitter i only care about looksthis is why society is so sensitive is because people like her,0
if woman made more than men nobody would complain about the wage gap,0
woooh sarah kliff lay some knowledge on me,0
blaire you look so pretty in softer lighting when you were cutting back between yourself and trisha i couldnt help thinkingwelldone plastic surgery vs badlydone plastic surgery just sayin,0
jason dodged a bullet just in time,1
omg where freelee at  she called it,0
there is no wage gap in general same job  same payment,0
there is no wage gap if there was a wage gap wouldnt places only hire women its a matter of carrier choice,0
love you based mom,0
not only a muscle difference males have stronger connective tissue tendons et al to withstand more stress and pressure they can train harder this is unfair,0
trisha and freelee both made money off this trisha would never go vegan unless a doctor told her that animal products were killing her slowly she wouldnt do it because some brats on the internet shame her weight and say she cant love herself till she stops eating meat,0
i am not a feminist and i actually really liked this video i think the best part was you gave a somewhat practical solution to a practical problem i wish more left leaning progressives would do that because i might actually join them at that point the biggest problem with progressivism is that their best answer to problems usually revolves around cultural change or societal change society and culture are peoples responses to the world around them its not just a dial you can turn to your liking the only real way you can change a culture or society is by forcing people against their will to believe your ideology which historically is best done through a freedomless totalitarian government like stalin or hitler,0
so inspired and proud of you,0
yes go trish proud of you,0
to be honest there really isnt a wage gap and if there is its near nothing its an earnings gap,0
make schools whole food plant based,0
trish looks so unhealthy like not only too much botox but also just sick her skin is blotchy and pale her lips are an odd color she looks dehydrated her eyes are sinking in farther every video and she looks like she has a crack addiction she knows how much attention her mental breakdowns get her and that means more ads im not sure if she actually needs help or shes just playing it up for the camera,0
blair booger lol,0
tbh i still dont understand lol,0
hisssss who wait just me ok ill leave now,0
whats wrong with the black girls lips were they stung by a swarm of bees theyre also lopsided the right side droops a lot more than the left,1
i think what most are missing from this video is that the wage gap is inherently caused by culture and the disproportionate effect children have on women vs men the wage gap problem is an apples to oranges issue because its caused by forces primarily outside of the workplace but we see its effects as the average wages between men and women what vox is trying to say is that to fix this inequality we should approach it by giving women more opportunities to balance this extra demand placed on them or some how alleviate it through policy whether its better childcare maternity and paternity leave to allow the father more time to help or more flexible work hours its not about trying to pay women more to compensate but by giving them the tools to be on an equal footing which i think we can all agree with,0
this video makes me ashamed to be trans gtfo trisha you toxic asf,1
feminists bitch about being paid less than men okay well maybe if you got a job in any of the fields that men typically work in eg mining construction railroads etc then you would have the same pay rate i dont think that some lady who works at a hotel reception or hair salon should make the same as a man who is up to his elbows in shit to fix a broken pump at a sewage treatment plant,1
speaking out doesnt justify the unfairness,0
someone say something ,0
im so proud of you trish,0
dem parents twisted,0
there is no difference in men and women absolutely nothing see there i said it so it must be true once the ncaa allows trans boys to run as women without any meds or anything womens sports will be done where are all the feminists now men run everything even women sports now lol,0
lets close the wage gap white straight men arent evil,0
trisha is crack cocaine in human form,1
what the hell is this world coming to,0
dont eat as much as you want just eat until you are truly satisfied common misconception misunderstanding the point is you dont have to calorie restrict but you dont overstuff yourself so happy for you hope you enjoy it,0
a lot of guys work longer,0
i feel attacked,0
i bet a lot of women got upset by learning the truth because now they cant play the victim card and have nothing to complain about,0
omg i looooove you so much ,0
trisha you know what i mean me actually no i didnt understand any of that wtf,0
just subbed  vegan for life,0
comments are lame get better jokes,0
i dont know if i would say im confused ill say it then  youre confused,0
espero que contine siendolo y no sea slo para llamar la atencin sino que lo sienta de verdad no es una dieta no es para conseguir un cuerpo sino que es respeto a los animales a mi por ejemplo ariana grande me decepcion bastante al verla lamer un donut en una tienda cuando reivindica que es vegana aclaracin esto ltimo no estoy segura de si era un donut vegano o no,0
an other solution ti close the gender pay gab could be by making more and better kindergardens and places you can bring your child when it is sick,0
they keep saying shethats a manwtfget these weirdos some help,1
look at who work at fast food restaurants or grocery stores and you see mostly womenthey choose they bullshit ass jobs,1
freelala secret fetish is meat,0
okay i hate trisha shes basically rachel dolezal on crack who hung out too much off of western ave and south virgil after getting slapped by ms in gang bangs too much that needs to be dicked down by many men on pornhub thats all shes worth,1
mommytang has the best vegan recipes,0
gender pay gap in modelling industry sees women earn  more than men supply and demand folks its not a conspiracy,0
im so sick of hearing so much about the wage gap the only reason why there is a wage gap is because women are usually the ones that take care of the kids and then when the women go back to work when they are  they are starting a new job so they obviously dont get paid as much as the guy thats been working that same job for  years its not a wage gap its a gap between new workers and experienced workers my parents were both engineers working for the same company in the same job and my mom made less money than my dad purely because she was  years behind in experience,0
im a transsexual female even castrated i have an unfair advantage they shouldnt be allowed to compete against the other girls fact is they wont beat the boys though if they are castrated,0
make them go on the boy tean,0
this is what she does when shes not relevant anymore nothing new but a troll,0
trish could have saved everyone this mess if she just understood what gender fluid is,0
im sure ppl think im crazy yes,0
so cool to be able to see this live in ,0
feminists will watch this video but still goes like we are paid less this is sexist why cant we be paid more,0
wow trisha really doesnt understand how anything works wtf thanks for making this blaire maybe itll help her understand sexuality  gender,0
sounds like she had another mental breakdown,0
the wage gap is real but its only like  and it hasnt been proven to be an act of discrimination,0
when i first saw this i thiught she was just doing it just cause its trendinf every where,0
and the sad thing is they literally celebrate as if they accomplished something this country is being destroyed theres no way that this is fair and im so sick of the gay community and all of their demands and the democrats are the biggest crooks of all,1
thats gender fluid sis,0
yall boys run with the boys,1
wheres freelee hello,0
hahahahahahahahahaha people who take her seriously are the fucking issue here,0
they need their own league unfair advantage over the girls theyre still men,1
there is no wage gap because if there was no one would hire men lets say i was an employer why would i want to hire  men for  each when i could hire ten women  each as an employer i would like to spend the least money and therefore wouldnt hire men as they would cost me more wage gap disproven,0
thank god for you blair thank you for this xx some truth finally,0
try the earth balance cheese puffs and mac and cheese they are so good and smart balance butter,0
please explain how vegans are messing up gods creation  because that makes no sense ,0
they would be mediocre in mens sports but win against women totally unfair,1
thumbnail looks like sucking dick nice,1
trish needs help lmao,1
okay girl thats called being gender fluid and the only thing you are relating too as a guy is ur lack of hygiene,0
this video needs to be shown to someone who thinks the gender wage gap is real,0
 this video specifically asserts that there is not a a wage discrepancy due to sexism or anything like that  this video attributes the cause of what wage discrepancy to the different occupations women choose to take  this video recognizes that women are more likely to raise children and does not suggest that this should change  this video acknowledges that as jobs become more flexible child care becomes less of a conflict and thus narrows the otherwise natural gap  this video does not suggest that anything needs to be done other than maybe encourage possibilities that make occupations more versatile they dont argue that any sexism exists in the first place to fix but merely that the wage gap will disappear as jobs become more flexible come on people if you want to argue against the ignorance spouted about how sexist the world is make sure that youre actually targeting the right things if anything this video attacks the fallacy of the  cents figure,0
slay trish i have been a vegetarian since june th and i want to go vegan i usually have  vegetarian meals a day and one vegan but i try to stay away from animal products as much a possible a good thing to try if you dont want to give up milk is almond milk it honestly tastes better than regular milk and is way better for you and the animals and spinach and kale salad with veggies mixed in is to die for once you go vegan you will have way more energy better skin and you will be happier because your helping out the animals love you trish,0
tbh me trying to understand how i feel about my life,0
freelee im back and forth with the vegan thing girl i wanna do it but idk if i can in the video you make for trisha can you please explain your diet in details and how it was when you first started im new on your channel,0
i dont see gender so there is no wage gap,0
love you blaire love my scentbird and supporting you its continuously refreshing to hear your opinions on these crazy ass things that ppl do i share your vids with friends keep being amazing and always being blatantly honest love you girl,0
i have been vegan for yrs and am thrilled to see the sudden surge in interest in living a compassionate life whilst we are gaining ground we must not get complacent animals are still suffering and being murdered in their billions heres to an even kinder  untileverycageisempty,0
uh what about the wage gap between white and black people,0
well done you make sure you eat plenty im so delighted for you i hope you commit to this making the ethical connection will make it impossible for you to fail you can do it be brave youre really doing so much good here all the very best with everything xxx,0
maddox made a video about the same subject serveral years ago it quiet interesting too warning maddox is quiet straight forward and doesnt care if someone gets offended d,0
andrayas father is just happy his little boy is doing well in sports,1
trisha has lost her fucking mind but why i know shes a troll but this time i think she just fully dgaf ,1
 thank you was looking forward to this almost a new year wish the earth a great   save lives go vegan,0
only in america,0
it is an unfair advantage for abc to pass criticism of this obvious physical advantage off as transphobia is pathetic,0
how dare you inject facts into their half thought out rants,0
wow women have kids and do child bearing what it kind of seems like women are naturally inclined to be better at taking care of kids,0
watching this while on quaratine ,0
it is an unfair advantage as males they are faster then women,1
what if the left concedes the data presented here but argues that womens choices arent really free  that societal conditioning by the patriarchy is to blame,0
i like how shes supportive even though shes going for this temporarily im glad shes supporting her unlike how vegan gains is such a dick about if youre not all in,0
no trisha you arent trans you just dont like gender stereotypes its either that or youre doing this for attention which either way is fucked up also how can you be a bisexual woman and a gay man,0
no just another video for shock and awe and of course attention seeking,0
if the wage gap was true dont you think businesses would only hire women because they could pay them less,0
i know this is the nd rd or th video you watched of me but you havent hit that button yet omg youre psychic,0
funny thing hiring only women would destroy your company,0
at this point or really any points of her career its obvious that shes using the troll reputation because she knows that if its too offensive and stuff there will always be those who will say shes just trolling and sweep it under the rug and she can comfortably gain views and clicks and whatever makes the money nowadays shes a troll is not an excuse explanation nor justification for her being a pathetic asshole,1
no im a straight bitch but im a single mother and stand on my own,0
better than buzzfeed,0
how to get rich as a woman study why men are richer than women inb triggered jokes m,0
i wonder where do the early dislikes come from i mean whenever i come to a video by a notification there is a likedislike ratio of sorry for bad english,0
omg im so happy for you  and i so hope you stay vegan after those  weeks cuz its amazing  we all love you and are supporting you all the best trish d,0
tricia im a white straight cisgendered male gay transsexual strong independent black woman,1
hey babe your probably feeling non binary because the term transgender doesnt apply to your scenario you can still use the pronouns he himshe her and be gender non identified,0
mommy tang is vegan i recomend you subscribe to her,0
omg this makes me so happy good luck trish make sure you eat enough rice and pasta as well as the fruit and veg beans and lentils are great for protein and i take some b on the side which is really important im really proud and dont be too hard on yourself if you accidentally eat something thats not fully vegan bc thats an easy mistake to make at first i hope it works for you and that you stick with it ,0
propaganda to the max,0
i dont think she is trans because she contradicting herself and she identified as gay black and chicken nugget its makes people not believe her she entertaining but i cant rust shit she says compared trans folks ik who explained there transition doesnt line up she seems more either she has some internally hate societal expectation of womeninternal sexism or confused i am very un traditional woman im assertive career driven etc but doesnt make less of women also most people make an effort to social transition or physical,0
id like to think all this is true can someone please give me some sources for the facts here because prageru have a fairly horrendous reputation for simply appealing to their audience over giving the complete accurate story case and point their video on carbon dioxide which was painfully inaccurate,0
im vegan and i need more recipes for food anyone has a website  me or anything,0
their chromosome makeup is xy  male we believe scientists on global warming why not biology,0
i give you props for this trish,0
someone give this women a gold star i literally would buy a flight to america just to give this woman a hug thank you so much you have done the world a huge favour,0
freelee you should react to pewdiepies latest videos it about vegans,0
you guys dont get to tell her what she can identify as,0
please consider checking out gardein and quorn veggie burgers and chicken they are amazing ,0
unfortunately women take up more household related tasks because of children because there is a level of biology that plays a part in which preferences both genders have vox couldnt and wouldnt state this because it is deemed as somehow sexist and politically incorrect,1
i hate trish she is such an offensive person and such a moron how does she have any fans,1
watching this will eating meat and drinking milk and goddamn it its good,0
in order to conclude that the wage gap is a problem you have to start with the presupposition that  the only thing people care about is money and  women have no will of their own and are simply puppets subjected to the world men choose for them,0
facts are mostly correct but the main question remains  why are those choices what women choose its because society doesnt provide a level playing field for women the expectation especially from the right is that women should take care of the children and thus make all the sacrifices,1
theres one more important point here the cost of employment over a year career who takes more days off whos more likely to need a long leave of absence who does the school call when they need a parent for a sick child i think if you threw in this factor you would find that  gap,0
this aint it chief,0
if they have a penis then they should run against others with a penis case closed,1
this is a great and much needed video but we should make working times more flexible just to shrink the wage gap but instead to help a lot of peoples mental health as jobs with long working hours are largely responsible for stuff like depression anxiety and so on so we should be focusing more on that as it will also help shrink the wage gap as well,0
so the pay gap is basically between mom and others then isnt the issue when women get pregnant women have no other choice but take care of kids and work less while men have no choice but work harder if there is more support for working moms such as childcare and paternity leave this situation will be better,0
hi trisha you can get rice quinoa hummos pasta tofu rice noodles cauliflower and so much more,0
i dont believe a single thing trisha says anymore ,0
i love prager u,0
been vegan since earth day lovely decision,0
you women cried for years saying we are equal to men we are just as strong as a man and can do everything a man can do if not better why you think women are allowed to fight on the frontline in the army and now that you got what you all wanted your starting to realise that you women are weaker than us men ,0
yes yes omg i cant explain how happy i am reeaaaaallly hope you stick with it definitely wtch more documentaries like cowspiracy earthlings forks over knives ly gurl,0
trisha looks like shes on meth,1
theyre not female and never will be those who support them in this lie are just as guilty and they all have been judged by god as being totally depraved and beyond redemption the fire of eternal hell awaits them all,1
so happy for you dont get discouraged at the beginning because the first  days for me were difficult after a month it wasnt even in my thoughts anymore that i was missing out on being able to eat certain foods its actually the perfect diet for foodies i eat when i want and as much as i want and my body has never looked better if people would just try it i would say more than half would stick to it just because of the amazing health benefits looking amazing while eating as much as you want and most importantly making a positive impact on this planet and for animals i hope you stick with it im so excited to see the positive impact i know it will have on your life,0
never before have i been so happy to see an ad d,0
its as simple as if women get paid less then men then there would be no men working because women are cheap labour just like immigrants,0
this so sucks i could have been the greatest female athlete in history,1
 i think she meant thats something she struggles with as a woman when women are assertive its wrongly seen as being a bitch its a very common problem in workplaces but when men are assertive its just normal conversation its in the same realm as women being told to smile more but youd never say that to a man sooooo annoying,0
ive never been so confused in my entire life,0
the accent of this person makes it very difficult to take this seriously,0
heyy freelee could you please make a video on why you have to carb the fuck up caus i was talking to my mom about becoming vegan and she still doesnt understand,0
what is this blasphemy facts you cant use those,0
im only on here because im in school and we have a sub,0
its helpful to count calories in the beginning to make sure you are eating enough the biggest mistake people make is simply not eating enough,0
keep in mind though trisha paytas is one of the biggest trolls on youtube she intentionally makes up controversial bullshit to drive traffic to her channel and create disagreements and arguments in her comment sections she doesnt actually think shes trans she just wants ad revenue and knows people will click this video to tell her shes an idiot,1
jesus christ what happened to her face did she start smoking crack or meth or something she looks like some  whore,1
two boys afraid to race other boys,1
thank you for this,0
all these stupid ass feminists out here saying theres a wage gap theres an earnings gap because of life choices but there is no wage gap,1
you might gain weight at first because your body is healing from old eating disorders but after that your probably lose a lot of the weight once everything evens out,0
do i think im a transgender yes a thousand  do i identify with my natural born gender a thousand  thats kinda the thing with being transgenderyou dont identify with your biological gender this is the whole point you dont like your breasts you dont like your curves and the term theythem has nothing to do with being transgender most people who use the pronouns theythem do not identify with either the female pronouns sheher nor the male pronouns hehim im not saying that transgender people can not identify with theythem im saying that it doesnt have anything to do with transgender,0
um i was a tomboy for a very long time and still prefer to do guy things i got more girly as i got older too that being said im a tomboy and yes i love being a girl yeah i have way more guy friends so what hun btw i was bi back in the s when we were hated by the lg community thank god i got away from everyone trying to label me my homosexual friends demanded i be gay because i like to do guy things pretty telling huh yeah im me and i dont need anyone to label me i had to run girl away im done supporting that lobby who labeled me hypocrites,0
rice potatoes beans amys vegetarian chili is also vegan should be at target daiya cheeseyou should melt it first should be at sprouts tofurky lunch meats  should be at trader joes and sprouts smart balance dairy free butter doritos sweet chili get frozen berries and make smoothies with just water sprouts sometimes has cotton candy grapes naturally flavored like that califa farms iced coffeeat target and sprouts ill tweet you more ,0
its almost like peoples incomes are based on the hours they work and the profit they create,0
women are typically higher in agreeableness and being agreeable doesnt normally work well in business,0
vegan isnt just fruit  gotta get those veggies gurl,0
yay im so proud of you this is amazing,0
do you really believe everything happens for a reason,0
i wish i could a week on the internet without being called uneducated by a vegan,0
thank you just thank you,0
stay as far away from freelee as you can theyve pulled so much shit since she was at your house its stupid shes an actual criminal she turned a few million ppl against veganisim from her casey niestat video alone trisha she will back stab you,0
this question just makes it all mess up if women earn less than men why dont companies only hire women,0
make beating on women great again this is the type of stuff feminists groups should attack instead of worrying about toxic masculinity ,0
you need more starches potatoes sweet potatoes rice beans squash etc have a bunch of mexican food salsa guacamole rice beans corn etc youll be satisfied,0
eat fruit yes but dont listen to freelee you will not want to be vegan omg i hope you read my comments please go to freaking high carb hannahs channel omg you will not succeed only on fruit i know you love rice and pasta go to high carb hannah omg i hope you read my comments,0
these prager u vids are an enigma to me one can be a thoughtful factbased argument there is no gender wage gap war on boys feminism  and the next can be an unfactual highlyopinionated rant dangerous people are teaching your kids everyone should stand for the national anthem you guys definitely keep me guessing if nothing else,0
ha i subbed after one vid,0
no one asked for this video ,0
to be fair trishas making as much of an effort as the gamestop its maam person and numerous jurisdictions at the behest of trans activists have self identification as the only criteria trishas probably trolling but its only possible because politicians listened to activists not doctors and scientists  this will all get weirder and more confusing as time goes on i expect,0
everybody says this but eat carbs eat lots of fruit too those little bitty containers wont make you full,0
she ate chicken on sc ,0
guys she is not vegan never went,0
i cant stand trisha ive wanted someone to roast her forever its not like she makes it hard to do,0
amazing guys vegan since  thanks to the game changers go vegan ,0
where can i get your merch ,0
i wouldnt exactly say that you can eat as much as you want without gaining weight or even for weight loss normally the amount you want to eat is equal the amount you need if you dont have disordered eating habit though if you have been restricting for so long then you might want to eat more than you need which results in gaining weight but this shouldnt scare you off since you need your body to gain that weight in order to cure the metabolic damage and increase your basal metabolic rate and eventually youll be at an optimal weight for your body type hope this was helpful ,0
theyre boys  its unfair,0
its not sexisim its common sense well common sense is sexisim for femmenist and leftist what do you guys expect xd,0
hey freelee i know you wont see this but i need your help ive went vegan im on day  but im only  and my mo doesnt agree with the vegan diet and refuses to buy vegan food for me what should i do because i really want to stay vegan but i have no food right now,0
you cant close the wage gap if you want to earn more as a woman dont have kids or make the man do more for your kid you must be a dumb ass not figure that one out dont use the wage gap as a thing for argument sort your own wages and get a union fuckface,0
why didnt they interview the other real ladies who are most affected by this,1
so happy youre going vegan the only thing that i kinda disagree with is when you said dont watch those videos i know its so sad to watch  but i think its better that people watch them so they know whats really going on again so happy youre going vegan ,0
anyways im going to mcdonalds yall want anything,0
she does shit like this all the time i used to be a fan but i cant support someone who trolls people to stay relevant shes even mentioned on shanes podcast she lies in some of her videos and that its an act,0
i got cheated on because im masculine energy ,0
yay trisha welcome to the club,0
this is so awesome trish i had a hard time when i started going vegan the detox period was pretty brutal but its so worth it im about  months in now and ive lost so much weight without even trying that hard,0

i am vegan only  month and days but the day i started being vegan i realized that it was the international vegan day maybe it will sound silly but i thought that it was my fate and from the first day i have never missed anything of the non vegan foods,0
there is no wage gap there is a payearnings gap,0
really though who is her dealer,1
love you girl ,0
i love soaking tofu in some of my favorite flavors overnight like bbq buffalo or general tsos sause and baking it for dinner,0
the wage gap is simply the difference in behavior and interest among men and women in very wide population samples unless the individual is discriminated against or limited i dont see why we should try to fix something which is only a result of peoples free choices the solution would be to trade individual freedom for a  equity number that looks good on paper but doesnt actually make anyone happier sounds like a double loss for everyone,0
shes borderline thats what she is and she needs help,0
yaaaas trisha slay veganism is magic xx,0

lol arent women the most vocal supporters of lgbt yes let them be happy,0
you will probably gain wheigt but when your body gets that youre not starving yourself any more it will stop storage food so in the long run you will loose wheigt  and btw welcome to our secret little vegan clublove tin,0
it is not really true you cant just eat as much as you want on a vegan diet it is just that if you are on a raw vegan diet or raw till four trying to eat those  kcal on raw fruit and vegetables might be a little difficult because of the amount of food you gotta eat to eat enough d so that is why they say eat as much as you want but in fact you can be vegan and overeat if you eat only vegan breads grains potatoes oils too much nuts etc i think if i am wrong can anybody explain it better d ,0
ok trisha has went vegan there is no way in hell i shouldnt get into it at this point lmao,0
i just adore you blaire,0
but to see your body transform it will take time depending on how you have treated it in the past everyone is different personally when i became vegan i went from a size  to a size  in  months  dont give up,0
isnt the paygap just a yield gap that has been misread,0
welcome to the journey,0
for making going vegan a bit easier just check out recipes from hot for food minimalist baker and marys test kitchen their recipes will give you a shit ton of inspiration and just so yummy also since you live in america it will be so easy for you because  their are a shit ton a restaurant and cafes that you can just eat at when u dont want to cook and  their are so many mock meats and yoghurt and mock stuff that taste great if you ever crave anything you can just buy a great substitute or find in a vegan restaurant or just cook it you have so many options it should be pretty easy biggest tip you have to eat a bit more then usual because vegan food is less caloricly dense most of the time you dont even have to change ur diet if you dont want to its just the art of substitution if you had like a yoghurt for breakfast just eat a vegan one or a breakfast sandwich you can make a vegan one or most probably buy one ok hope this helps sorry that this so long ,0
 i can relate so much ,0
pathetic it really is unfair advantage just a little,1
i identify as a largemouth bass guess its legal for me to pee in the lake ,0
im gonna show this video to whatever girl peeping about men earning more,0

literally got so surprised i almost broke the computer ,0
i have to see it to believe it  trish  vegan  o,0
how dare you bring actual facts into this debate,0
they did actually lie about how the wage gap is calculated and the aauw that they referenced does not say the wage gap is from occupation they lied about what another organization says and no one bothered to fact check,0
i bet the people who disliked are feminists,0
yeah lion tamer,0
jason has left the chat,0
im so happy for you trish i hope everything goes well for you thank you so much for helping her freelee you are truly the mama vegan ,0
ok i dont even know what im supposed to think anymore i give off a very masculine and dude vibe hell i wear mens cologne because i like smelling like a man and i dont know who im attracted to i dont care abt what pronouns i use the only thing i set in stone identify as is asexual thats it thank you for listening to me ted talk,0
i disagree i know a true real life example of a wage gap i know a professor who got a job in a southern college and was paid less than her husband who was hired a year later he has less education and less experience than she does and yet she was told that he earns more because he is head of the home and that they both receive the money so why does it matter how each of them get paid they quit and got a job at a college in the north instead she now gets paid more since she works harder than her husband and has more education and experience,0
stick with your own sex you were born with,0
listen up just fruits and veggies will n o t fill u up ben and jerry has amazing vegan ice cream dominos even has vegan pizza there is real food that is vegan so make sure ur eating vegan foods that fill u up,0
im sorry ifeel there struggle but its fuckin unfair,1
how to stop the wage gap just never have children,0
your not making ugly faces your just ugly and your truly full of yourself in reality you havent a clue you simply just go with the current trends if tomorrow they suddenly stop pushing the gay agenda and did a complete  youd be the first to throw insults at gays your kind is the worst you wouldnt know a original thought if it slapped you in the face such a sheep  your everything thats wrong with our current situation here in america totally unoriginal just another parrot ,1
i wanna fuck that young blonde with the bleached hair oh and why are males allowed to run against females theyre male period,1
born a male u play with the men i identify as god so by my belief i should be able to take any all the performance enhancers i want cause i believe i supersede you  what a joke make a goddamn trans division if you want to play sports so damn bad leave the natural wemons division aloooone ,1
so maybe the question is why are those majors predominantly male or female im not debating that the facts are wrong but how does this pattern come about that males have the highest paying majors on lock down and females have the lowestgranted by choice but why did they choose that,0
you know what would be nice a video about some form of equality that isnt about the us,0
they are winning because they are boys point blank i dont see what the compelling argument is get them off the team because they are winning do to being guys whats the argument its like putting them in a boxing ring with a girl and they win and they say be happy for them or fight harder lol naw bitch your a dude girls will not give them a level of computation to say your a winner get them off the team its unfair point blank,1
trisha this is going to change your life youre spiritual grounding is going to go through the roof the high vibrational foods will blow your spiritual doors open the transition can be difficult but if anyone can benefit from it quickly and love it its you im very proud of you for making such a hugely healthy decision best to you my dear much love and light to you xo,0
i bet the patriarchy made those women choose a lower paying job,0
she prerecords her videos she made this video two weeks before her daddy issues video shoot shes not vegan she just posted a snapchat of her eating bacon and eggs yesterday she probably should of posted this video when she recorded it it would make more sense,0
these parents approved of therapy in hs this is weird,0
liking gay men doesnt mean youre a gay man it just means your trisha,0
stop the brainwashing and over the top putting ppl in fear that vegan will save the planet when its the complete opposite its not sustainable nutrient deficient and ruining the environment you will not win at the end and ppl will soon wake up and realize the deceptiveness of your agenda,1
i liked this video a month ago i came back today and found i had disliked it any answers youtube,0
her parents are complete idiots  its not fair to everyone else so you should remove your freak daughter,1
i used to be mostly drawn to gaybi guys not built ones the thin semiandrogynous boyish ones,0
almond milk if you want cereal ps lysm,0
trish im attracted to gay guys also trish that must mean im a trans man,0
i go out without makeup too trisha makeup is expensive id rather look like a crackhead in front of my clients dogs than use up all my sephora eyeliner in a week,0
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm yeah actual science still is relevent abc,0
maybe woman will stop complaining and do work then they will get paid equally easy problem solved,0
you should check out unnatural vegans channel shes much more neutral than other vegan channels using loads and loads of research material on her videos not to mention the diet she eats is much higher in protein than all these fruitarianhigh carb vegans not all vegan diets are the sameobvs and high sugar doesnt work for everyone good luck,0
she said while people think im schizophrenic and have multiple personally bruh thats not what it is shw out here confusing schizophrenia with personality disorder im out no facts in this vid,0
k dislikes k ignorant snowflakes,0
potatos potatos potatospotatos,0
i know you can do it babe xoxo,0
when women wanna get into the sewers do landscaping get dirty and go into fields that risk their lives ofher than the military come back to me with this bs,1
there is a wage gap its the reasoning behind it which is the issue this video shows that the reason there is a wage gap is justified,0
what people miss is that it doesnt exist and its been that way for almost  decades its incredibly disrespectful and horrific to our ancestors who actually lived in a world and country were they were treated as an inferior property of men if you want your statistics to look exactly the same take away all mothers children stop lying and spreading these lies to the generations to come you should be deeply ashamed and also get a life,0
how can you live with out bacon or meat just why,0
i now what shes coming from i have always wanted to be a girl and i thought i was born someone else in a different body i am not that happy of being a boy and going through what guys have to go through but i also dont want to go through the process of being trans i am gay i love being feminine if i could choose anytime i wanted to i would change to a girl without having to go through a different process i love you trisha there are a lot of haters in the comments but you keep being you and never stop being yourself ,0
yes im a feminist and i realise that the wage gap is highly exaggerated in the us and other firstworld countries but that doesnt mean that feminism is bad perhaps the extremists but not at the core of it or that gender inequality has been fixed developing countries have a huge gender inequality in literacy schoolingeducation work and relationships there has been so much progress made by the movement which is why we should keep the name feminism to respect and acknowledge the history and achievements made by some incredible people and groups but theres still so much progress to be made please dont harass people who use the word feminism or people who dont get all their facts right harassment does not educate people or allow for conversation can we instead be openminded kind and ready for compassionate discussion,0
blaire is the voice of sanity in this crazy selfish and selfserving world who woulda guessed,0
 were so sorry,0
pretty much vegetarian but watch chicken nuggetsk,0
i dont wear makeup like ever pretty much i must be trans  i dont understand what trish is trying to do anymore,0
im just gonna put this out here  dollars is not  less than ,0
i really hope you stick to being vegan  omg this makes me so happy trish,0
talk about luxury problems,0
can you please react to nicole williams peta campaign,0
joaquin phoenix is such a vegan king i love him so much,0
the first girl at a track meet to trip over her own giant cock,1
you need to invest in a sociology book or even dabble in a little bit of phycology vox invest in some real research woman dont tend to spend over  years in college but males do there is no wage gap just an intelligent gap by the way your wage gap on the business end is way off how many females own a business compared to malesblame it on having babies close your dam legs,1
im a vegetarian but i could not be vegan in a million years for one reason i love cheese ,0
what are you saying about jason lmao,0
i think that they should still compete but be barred from getting medals because the testosterone has similar affects to a performance enhancing drugs,1
they should not be running with girls thats a sport not society they should not be competing with girls put them with the boys and see if they break records there or even if they come n first,1
good for you you will be glowing after two weeks vegetarian diet wont make u skinny because of dairy but a vegan diet will i love the morning star products especially the meatless barbeque and sausage you can make blt sanwiches with vegan mayo bread cheese and bacon try smoothies in the morning with low carb rice powder also stir fry with tofu or beans is great for simple meals try veg soup or chill in a crock pot as it is easy and yummy avocado is very filling but limit pasta and bread,0
shes trying vegan not going vegan,0
i like it how this movie is explained by a woman it will make it just a little bit easier foe feminists to accept the facts,0
trish your so cute good for you ily xxxx,0
i freaking  christina hoff sommers,0
you guys make great informative videos,0
no one literally no one trisha im a transgender gay man me no sweets your just mentally unstable,1
this is her truth who is anyone to question or judge her for it you dont have to understand it its what was on her heart and what she lives with if she wants to be gender fluid its her life  let people live cant you just create a safe space for people to be without all this nonsense in the comments yall are fung weirdos,0
im glad that maccas have bent over backwards to introduce the impossible burger but how many decades until we see the vegan equivalent of the big bat burger with a side order of live baby mice  not fair,0
there is no gender wage gap  when controlling for all factors the wage gap is around  theyre not even trying lol,0
early signs of total collapse its trendy and cool to be trans or nonbinary or other nonsense it all started with tattoos and piercings all a game of who can be weirder than weird,1
holy schidt  teens i honestly thought trans teens were isolatedcases,0
 whole wheat toasted bread with peanut butter and honey is so good u can also have celery that gives amazing nutrience also u can make a protien shake with no substitutes because they have bad or less healthy choices than using only kale and fruits and ice,0
lol i love this freaks show thats happening in the west ,1
didnt mention the solution of men taking more responsibility for their children i guess its implied but still,0
yayyy trish iam so proud of you ,0
im mourning my last  brain cells dead,0
dont eat light weight things like fruit and expect to fill up u gotta eat potatoes beans rice pasta grains this seems so lame and gross but u can make it taste so good like you said how those brussel sprouts were good  veggies are good when grilled esp green peppers let your body adjust to the new diet you may gain some weight at first just because youre taking in more calories but veganism will clean out your body and eventually youll be down to your bodys best weight it takes awhile if youre willing to try veganism or even vegetaraianism without dairy you will end up with clear skin and less weight but for most diets to be effective you have to exercise thats why freelee is so toned i dont know if youre even going to read this but im really proud of you definitely search some vegan recipes on youtube it makes it so much easier and eating fruit all day instead of filling fiberrich foods will leave you super hungry and undercarbed ,0
so many you tubers are going vegan it makes me so happy ,0
get your frap with soy milk and no whip ,0
too bad we need someone to explain the free market,0
i am a women and want to be a drag queen am i a man im confused,0
ok girl you gotta buy more of those fruits buy those fruits in bulk  more food its sounds weird but you gotta eat more if your gonna keep the lifestyle going  ,0
k feminiazis disliked this video,1
and remember fruits and veggies have like no calories so if your meal is jus fruits like you showed you have to eat a lot of them because if you are full you are less likely to reach for something unhealthy and you need more calories to because your body will be burning a lot,0
i say this as a trans male my self trisha go fuck your self,1
this is why you dont see a wage gap in young people young women arent held back by social standards like older generations,0
hey trish i love you but this is a little inappropriate,0
dont let this make you forget the fact that dogs dont have brains,0
trish has mental issues she needs to get that blond wig off an read books instead of breathing in that hot air into her head i never liked her to begin with and yet ik something aint right about her since she gained popularity shes just an attention seeker its annoying trishapaytasisover,1
i need to go eat some chickfila and ponder wtf is this hilarity with trisha paytas now this made my day,0
this is way better than that horrible liz plank video you did on this same subject a while back,0
there is still an unaccounted pay gap that cant be explained by less experience or choice of workhours but that gap is only about  not the  or more some people throw around still a gap is a gap and worth trying to close although socioeconomic issues can still have effects long after the innitial cause is solved meaning that policy regarding the gap shouldnt be too radical or prevention of yesterdays problems,0
god fucking dammit i hate this fat bitch trisha paytas not only do i have a hard time sympathizing with transgenders as it is but this bitch is just using another victimized group to gain attention fuck her,1
trisha the man paytas thats going to be my wrestling name now,0
this channel is like the opposite of buzzfeed,0
i cant even never seen a person more starving for attention and money that this broad ,1
your life matters but animals life too whats for dinner verses whos for dinner the food that you eat is not something its someone you are not an animal lover when you choose to look after your pet and eat a different animal you dont kill them but pay someone to do so you kill them and they kill you back karmaillness,0
love you freelee great work and thank you,0
im in love with this woman,0
wait im confused so ur admitting that the wage gap is only the average of all women and all men and its not the same job whats ur issue then,0
youre not transgender youre just careless about your looks its called lazy ass you just dont want the troubles of brushing your hair and putting on makeup everyday  attention seeker alert ,1
i finally get to use this line trisha you dumb attention seeking slut just stop you sound like an airhead and look like  of you is plastic,1
hey trish try looking up mommytang on youtube she has the most amazing highcarb vegan foods,0
vegan food is less nutritious and tastes like shit,0
she already looks like a guy tf,1
very balanced bravo finally,0
i liked this video within the first  seconds because the intro is everything,0
the only thing i did not like was how stephanie rice had to say she went vegan when it wasnt trendy it doesnt matter if its trending or not when you decide to make the switch i believe having it trend is the only way people will actually accept it rather than make a mockery of it like many still do,0
aaaaannnnnnnnnndddddddddddd now i am gonna keep this in a playlist for when wage gap arguments cone up,0
what about the race wage gap the state wage cap the introvertextrovert wage gap there is simply no way to make every single category of people earn the same average amount this is a nonissue in every context,0
this is wrong and so fucked up i cant believe people are ok with  biological males competing with biological females its unfair and foul as fuckidc what your sexual preference is but im sick and tired of this lgbtq bs ass community trying to make everything gayand the rest of the world just supposed to deal with it this shit getting out of hand and they really need to be stopped by the people not the politicians and celebrities because they all jumping on the lgbt band wagon to get more votes followers and money they dont really give a fuck about their movement they just following the popular vote to get attention and its sad and disgusting if you ask me,1
it is not fair at all imagine a girl getting third place in a state meet against these  transgender girls they would lose a lot of college opportunities and overall wouldnt get first,0
something tells me if they both ran against other boys they would come in last place,0
yeah you did it,0
at  you can hear her whisper help me,0
all that botox is making her sick,0
unfair because physicallybiologically these are men,1
this is a logical argument oh so thats why extreme feminists so hear this,0
 angry lying feminists watched this video p,1
stop calling it a wage gap its not a wage gap you havent measured wages youve measured earnings ,0
it was a bit cherrypicking but in general a decent video on the gender wage gap,0
i figured being a vox video that it would have a leftist agenda but was very well balanced nice work great video informative and accurate companies arent actively discriminating its due to biology and biased cultural tendencies to leave women with larger burden of housework leading to them being unable to put as much focus on their careers also id mention men have biological advantage in physically demanding roles which often pay well,0
i start testosterone in less than  hours ive been waiting for this for six years i cannot tell you how fucking invaliding and disgusting and above all wrong and dysphoria inducing for actual trans people to hear you spread this absolute bullshit fucking stop,0
looking at her makes me want to get a flu shotmeh if i found a trans girl as beautiful as you blaire id give it a shotbut her she looks like the grime under the rim of a toilet unless you scrub it with clorox,1
going vegan buys a new leather handbag lmao girl please,0
the video alludes to women working in different fields  lower paid fields  earning less money and then goes on to completely ignore this for the rest of the video part of the sexism of the wage gap is that femaledominated professions are paid at lower rates than maledominated professions this isnt because they take on less risk or are less valuable to society it is because the value of these roles is not acknowledged because traditionally the value of women is not acknowledged the nursing profession the teaching profession the childcare profession  these are all highly valuable to society and high risk yet the are paid lower amounts,0
not a soul trisha yea im trans cause i liked having short hair and had crushes on gay guys  but i still identify as the gender i was born soooo,0
the thing they miss is that its a myth,1
so theres no discriminationcorrect ,0
one of my favorite meals are rice black beans and bananas ,0
as a straight guy who has never pushed past his curious phasei cant stand all of these people jumping on the trending bandwagon all they are doing is setting all genuine people and movements back how can anyone be taken seriously when there are people like this and others who blindly support them be who you are because thats who you are not because its trending,0
normally id joke about losing brain cells but this time i actually did,0
lol than hire only women srsly guys the girls in my office are always looking to cut corners male coworkers work harder,0
you have an issue with gender roles girl you clearly are confused and many women out here dont wear makeup  or everyday i was a tomboy never played with barbie or anything but loved monster trucks and stuff that does not make me or you a transgender person to me you made absolutely no sense in this video there is nothing wrong with women being what you said you are that makes you identity as a boy,0
you know what you deranged leftist idiots this is your doing know deal with it,0
im a straight man trapped in a straight mans body i think i should transition to saiyan,0
if they started hormones its not a advantage they are taking hormones that will help them physically and mentally transform into young women i will never understand the disrespect of others people are just mad because they won im sure this wouldnt be a problem if they lost you want to win u have to practice stop being cry babies they are not men anymore they have started hormones to become a women theres no advantage and people need to face the facts u cant accept it quit the track team,0
well congrats you got the views you wanted,0
this video sucked,0
this is getting out of hand dude these lgbtqrstuv people want special treatment boys against boysgirls against girls we need to start standing up against this its sad because people now a days are to scared to stand up because theyll lose a job etcits ridiculous,1
maybe im a gay man  wtf idk ps small youtuber ,0
i think what shes trying to say is shes pan,0
fuking brilliant tytytytytyyt god bless all animals and critters on our planet please people wake up,0
i thought someone texted me ,0
man dont say anything cause woman are quick to threw that insensitive card out but a little input on the situation how about boys and girls all race together and compete together dont separate the race on gender separate it based on age and maturity,0
im a transgender female trisha is notorious for being a troll its hard to believe her her reasoning for being trans is absolutely wack if she wants to be trans no one has an issue with that but i have no clue if this is a troll,0
hey trish i just went vegan too and i have a few tips  eat a ton i started out counting my calories because i wasnt eating enough calories i recommend mynetdiary in the app store if you want to count your calories i once ate  calories in one day dont be afraid to overeat if the food is healthy you can eat as much as you want  make healthy foods you dont like taste delicious i hate bananas but if i freeze them blend them up in a high speed blender with cocoa powder and almond milk it turns out like ice cream  to start out stock up on dairy free milks almond milk is my favorite vegan butters vegan chocolates and vegan snacks to cure those cravings they eventually go away,0
trisha paytas is famous for trolling she probably is not serious at all lol,0
to be fair its never simple there are certain industries where there very much is a gap in pay entertainment industries are notorious for this as are ceo positions but yes id agree the overly generalized idea of gender pay gap in all industries goes too far it depends on the individual cases,0
so u identify as a man that wants to identify as a woman uhmwhat,0
just a bunch of bullshit,0
ok so ive been fallowing you for awhile and the reason why is because i want to stop eating meat im mexican and a huge meat lover but i honestly want to stop i dont understand why its so difficult for me it like im just addicted but the more time passes by the more im starting to try to encourage myself to stop im thinking about mabye starting by becoming vegetarian first and mabye that way i can slowly transverse to becoming vegan what are your guys thought on that is that a good idea,0
im so excited for you my favourite vegan meal ever is stirfried veggie rice with soy sauce and ginger like you can look up these recipes oatmeal as well is incredible for breakfast also omg omg burritos i will live off of lots of guacamole and salsa and rice in a tortilla xxx,0
just because you want to cosplay as zac effron does not mean that you are transgender this is a joke trish stans dont come for me,0
so proud of you ive been vegan for a year now and will never consume animals the rest of my life the vegan community is awesome and were here to help,0
i know some females that would smoke them in running its all about you your motivation and if you want it no matter your gender,0
when you piss of both feminazis and meninists you know youve done something right,0
if trish can i can,0
awwe im so proud of you,0
i bit trisha edited her video while eating mcnuggets,0
this video is a life saver i got bullied by my history teacher over the pay gap ,0
you can eat nuts beans grains not only fruits,0
the wage gap even how theyre explaining it should be changed in definition because theyre explaining why women dont as a whole get as much as men theres not enough women in that field theres no prejudice within companies like that today in first world countries,0
what people miss about the gender gap in work suicides,0
ummok this is stupid why did i get this ad,0
you can make some frappuccinos vegan just replace the milk with soy or coconut milk and do no whip java chips caramel drizzle and white chocolate isnt vegan but most other stuff is,0
lmao theres a difference between being a manhead and trans tf,0
here in australia fires have burnt more than x the amount of hectares that were burned in the amazon,0
this is ridiculous,0
 minutes in and i am screaming edit  minutes in and still screaming,0
its only unfair because theyre winning once they start getting beat by biological females nobody in this comment section will care anymore if you support transgenders being able to use the womens restroom you support them being able to participate in womens sports as well it is what it is,0
 where feelings are more important than actual facts,0
first of all to everyone saying she failed she released i love chicken too i said i wanted to go vegan and i loved it so much but i didnt stick with it its not a lie she just needs to know not to do that maybe offer her some grapes or something lol,0
 new im deceased merch coming soon,0
someone needs to fix her meds shes a hot mess,1
in all of those pew research center studies in all but  men did equal or more work than mothers,0
wish you would have mentioned the choices people make,0
girl if you get the shits dont be alarmed,0
im not trying to be negative but i know from experience its hard to lose weight after just two weeks of veganism in fact you bloat a lot youre body wont be used to all the fiber and youll actually feel like youre gaining weight and although the bloating does go down i promise it takes a while and i worry youll be turned off it for life if you do bloat and stuff dont feel discouraged trisha youre body will thank you massively but maybe not right away youre skin will thank you right away tho you will start to fucking glow im not even kidding youre hair and nails will grow super quick and you will have hella energy i dont mean to put you down and im super proud youre giving it a go and spreading the vegan message just dont give up if it doesnt give you an immediate freelee body thats what i expected for myself and i weigh around the same as you haha love you sorry if this comes across negative xx,0
look at those muscles they are mens,0
the future is vegan ,0
i want to beat the living shit out of her,0
there still seems to be a problem with conflating earnings with wages you have to look at additional working hours overtime etc to have the most accurate conclusions,0
the thing i miss the most about the gender wage gap is when it existed for real,0
its cos women are pushed towards low paying jobs this is what my teacher says i dont think she likes ys,0
youre a fucking idiot,1
fuck im so excited for u,0
we want more of angelo,0
hello creators can we perhaps submit subtitles for our own countries id definitely show this to my friends and relatives and for most of them its easier to understand and focus more on the subject,0
ladies always get more tips than guys,0
i what even is this shes just spewing bs like almost none of this is true ,1
this fat unhealthy guy has anything to say against veganism  hahah ridiculous,1
literally almost all the trans youtubers i watch posted vids about her lmao trish is so fing dumb,1
im a dude who likes lesbians so like i am a transgender lesbian that used to be a joke,0
why the hell was this in my suggestion box two minutes in and you have both annoyed the hell outta me,0
no one is as smart as vegan god the lord of vegan brains mentor of millions of vegans gary yourofsky,0
vocal fry stop it,0
most important factor its nonexistent,0
is she going to be vegan or plant based she sounds like shes going to be plant based and not vegan shes calling it a diet rather than a lifestyle,0
you must try avocado toast its amazing  slices of brown bread with  mashed ripe avocado with a pinch of salt and peppertomatoes are optional but they taste amazing,0
you guys should create a spin off specifically focused on animal rights news and the activism thats being done this is great but it makes people think all is great within the movement there is so much work that needs to be done we need to highlight activism and liberation attempts expose political ties and injustices within animal ag bring attention to animal rights documentaries and alc conferences around the world,0
why i dont feel like this is true i feel like she is saying this just for a paycheck and wont actually do it,0
well that lasted longshe was shovelling chicken down her throat like they were going extinct on her last video,0
yay so proud of you,0
womens pay gap gets smaller when shes older cause the guy already retired from work so there doesnt earn as much also  average wtf the overall average her is around ,0
thank you so much for this informative video i got so much out of it this is so movingim stunned klaus youre welcome keep up the good work,0
lets spread the word everybody share the movie on facebook and social media dare your friends to face the truth and plant that seed  ,0
rice cucumber corn salad,0
this lady also forgot to mention occupational segregation occupational segregation is seen in trends when people hold what were once considered stereotypically gendered jobs like women being nurses and men being doctors the previously maledominated jobs continue to pay more and the traditionally femaletrack jobs tend to pay less to this day,0
vegan  that person that shows up at the party uninvited and starts an argument thats a vegan,0
lol this is absolutely disgusting,0
the other night i had a dream freelee was my mom and she helped me go vegan i loved it lmao,0
warning triggered feminazis and misogynists before,1
as a trans man i can say shut the fuck up clown,1
you need to seriously educate yourself before making a video like this unless you have dysphoria you are not transgender not all transgender people got through the whole transitionmeaning surgery most can socially and hormonally transition and that is enough you need therapy and education you are offending true transgender people by saying you are  female and ok yet are transgender this is a joke you dont have dysphoria therefore you are not transgender,0
keep telling the truth and changing the world freelee ,0
send this to all feminists,0
i support the argument that they shouldnt compete against women this is based on their physical advantages but from a biological perceptive some women produce more testosterone and are taller those that give them an unfair advantage or should those women be placed with men its a tricky subject nonetheless by these standards usain bolt shouldve been band because of his unfair advantages lol find it kinda funny,0
she probably should have really thought this through before posting this video for the world to see being a part of the lgbtq  community i dont think she tried to offend the community but this isnt a well thought out decision personally i feel she should explore herself more and acclimate herself to the proper terminology,0
yay trish if youre trying to lose weight try to avoid sugar salt fat and oils in your foods  of course the natural sugar that is found in plant foods is fine good luck,0
im just here searching for freelees comment,0
want to know if they have an advantage see where they place against boys,0
i think people are literally to blame for this like this crazy chick lives on the internet shouldve never even had the thought of being a male if it wasnt for people being so crazy about it and trying to question everything they do,1
i was gonna go vegan but then i remembered god put animals on the earth for a reason and he said in the bible that they are there to provide food for us yes some animals may get tortured or killed but thats because ir was given to us as food,0
everyone bashing her cos shes attention seeking which she is yet its the same people that advocate for people being whatever gender you feel regardless of the reasons she can identify as a man if she wants i dont give a flying fck just find it ironic,0
vegan for everything ,0
you got it yassssss,0
this is why trans people arent taken seriously,0
jesus keep the genders separate in sports females and males have a different anatomy its still a handicap for all the female athletes now those females tracker runners who were trying hard to win scholarships just got cheated out of a future with opportunity,1
this would make sense if men and women were equal beings which they obviously arent i guess it takes a  year old looking at hisher genitals to know that,0
if the woman works as long as men theyll get paid the same easy as that,0
wow k people are triggered,0
no way trish i have never felt so proud in my entire life you can do two weeks your making such a good influence on all your viewers the fact that u ate trying is amazing u need to go buy yourself a blender for fruit smoothies every day ,0
 my fifth year as a vegan and wouldnt have it any other way,0
i was scrolling through instagram the other day and i came across a comment that said the wage gap exists i told the person that the wage gap wasnt real and i actually used real facts to back up my arguments what triggered me the most was that the person had no common sense and didnt even wanna listen to meread my comments its so sad that ppl like this exist,0
its pretty simple different job different pay you want a higher paying job work for it its illegal to pay someone lower because of their gender,0
what to eat while on your diet spagatie or vegetable dumpling or grilled vegetables and veggie burgers and chips and dips and my favor is sweet pato fries there sooooo good ,0
definitely unfair  those are born men no matter what you identify as your gender your biological make up is what you are at your cellular level please stop this madness,1
its because of different passions more woman choose to go to lower playing jobs than men like teaching because of their personal preference and more men wok in construction and computer science which you are payed higher,0
the video is better because it is a women roasting feminists,0
as a nonbinary person i can say you need therapy and not for your supposed did,1
you are amazing,0
you are a very pretty dude are you fully transitioned,1
i never thought id see the day trisha goes vegan so shocked but so happy for her,0
first of all  you did not loose your sd card thats a bold face lie i watch freely and her card became corrupt and they tried to save the footage and no video stores could salvage it so she said to be fair you cant upload yours you ate vegan dog nuts and she showed you slaughter videos she even has footage of you trying the doughnuts on her video she tells your entire conversation about why your not gonna post yours you get caught everytime you lie second everything you bought is fruits  straight sugar  you willllll gain a ton of weight you have to eat a balanced diet or you will get very sick you have to have nuts veggies rice beans avacados proteins healthy fats fiber carbs you name it each of those things plays a part in bone density blood pressure kidney  liver function major organ function you can die from not having a proper diet thirdfreely works out and rides a bike for  miles daily they literally spend hrs a day on fitness so she will burn off the  bananas a day she promotes go watch all the other videos of girls who got deathly ill on her diet who gained lbs her man durian uses steroids to build muscle who knows what she does she ate like  mangos on one sitting it was like  callories no one can eat that and be so tiny ask any dr i am all for you being vegan but listen to a real dietician be smart about it,0
this video has an extraordinarily high proportion of dislikes ive never seen anything close to this on right leaning media other than fox news is vox the liberal fox,0
i was trying to translate the video in italian language but it says that it is not allowed,0
man i feel bad for her she going though something onbvi i mean not dysphoria but something,0
i love how shane and her made fun of vegan foods awhile ago and now shes going vegan,0
freelee youre damaging the vegan movement,0
honestly were all hating but like honestly i just dont understand let trish be trish ya know ,0
i thought this woman was just confused but sort of relatable in her confusion until she said i think of myself as a man because im assertive okay now thats just sad menopause will fix that wrong way of thinking but young women should not have to wait that long,0
getting better and better every year thanks for another great video pbn,0
girl you took the bait,0
literally the ad before this video was degree for women and had some girl in a suit prepping in front of the mirror going to confront her boss about her male colleague making more than her and then it ended with a slogan about closing the wage gap this was a good video but i wish you had been more critical of the major public figures who purport the wage gap to be something it fundamentally it is not overt discrimination against women when its more about lifestyle choices,0
i live for your videos youre so blunt and real with everyone and its so fucking refreshing big fan keep the videos coming love you,0
the main argument here is that the wage gap exists because women do more housework and childcare duties therefore they cant focus on their careers as much as a man who does less childcare and housework the problem with this is that it assumes women are forced into this role by the patriarchy and they dont want to be the main childcare provider by their own choice which is largely not true of course there are individual situations where it may be the case that the man wants to do more or equal childcare to the woman and that couple is free to factor that into the way they situate their lives which im sure does happen already but by and large most women prefer to do more of the childcare and let the man do more of the breadwinning so they can spend their time with their child while theyre growing up and less slaving away at work while the child is with a someone else and both parents are doing this willingly as what they see as the best way to raise the child and of course no one wants to do housework generally speaking but whoever is home more will obviously be the one to do more housework in this case women are home more so they end up doing more im a woman in a thankfully childless relationship with a man and i make more and therefore he does more housework and takes care of the animals where as most of my coworkers who are nearly all female mothers prefer to work less and stay home with their kids like i described and i am an exception of sorts also the single mom issue is a totally separate situation that wasnt addressed in this video and i will say that they tend to be royally screwed because they cant focus all their time on children or on their careers which is why a free to hire government salary nanny would be a great thing to incorporate into the usa basing it off of how its done in france that way the single moms pay wouldnt go right back into baby sitting while theyre trying to make a profit on top of all their other bills and expenses that come with children,0
you know what i would call this a tom boy somtimes and a girl girl sometimes because what i heard was you like man hair and being a little more guy ish but maybe thats just me i hope you can figure it out t i really hope you find someone you care about and they care and except you ,0
discussing what a mess they are not chicks with dicks they are dudes with dicks,1
this video has a point but it doesnt tell the whole story often traditionally female fields are paid less because they are mostly women also women are less likely to ask for a pay raise partially bc they are more likely to be looked on as pushy or aggressive than a man would be it is often harder for women to get to higher level positions that pay more because they arent viewed as as good leaders and male bosses and even as a few studies have shown other women may discriminate against women when giving promotions many high paying male dominated fields also have problems with sexual harassment silicon valley is a good example which obviously discourages female workers the problem is not companies deliberately paying women less it is that it is harder for women to get into higher paying fields,0
 go freelee go spread your good message,0
omg whats this sht,0
nigga i mean so what its just running i wouldnt take it that srsly,0
im just a regular boring chick born a chick but that trisha lady is begging for attention  oh some peoples kids ,0
i love it,0
is this god,0
its all started with non contact sports but what happen when a contact sports like boxing or mma legalise transgender to compete they would absolutely fucked those women up bigger hands muscle bones,0
everything christina said was true unfortunately she did not address the issue that many have with the gender wage gap the choices themselves why dont women pursue stem careers as much as men telling girls that they are discriminated against is definitely counterproductive but actively encouraging them to pursue these types of interests is necessary since they are unlikely to have female role models in these fields no women dont want to get paid the same to do social work as a petroleum engineer they want to be given every opportunity to become a petroleum engineer that a man has please check your privilege before discounting this statement,0
ridiculous humanities downfall,0
good grief attention whore says what id never even heard of her until this whole thing came out,1
you might need to incorporate more vegetables instead of fruits  since fruits contain a lot of sugar also i gained weight when i went vegan and thats what discouraged me,0
you know what i like this video its not just some ignorant feminists saying we earn less because sexism i tend to take arguments in which certain properties of a group of people are the focus rather than their defining qualities here they dont say women earn less because sexism but rather that women earn less because they take different jobs or that women and men in the same field dont make as much because women tend to work less or care more for children  and what not good job vox youre actually educating people,0
this is some milli vanilli shit right here girl you know its true oooh oooh oooh i love you ,1
her brain is full of cheeto dust,0
theyre still men,1
k people are in denial and cant accept logic,0
so theres an unaccounted for ,0
yes trish i went vegan almost  months ago and it was definitely one of the best choices i have made,0
its about more than just winning a metal for some girls they work their asses off to compete and have a chance to become an elite athlete and thats being taken away i support equality but isnt what equality is this is going to ruin womens sports its sad to see after years of women fighting to just be able to play sports at all and be respected and now this ,0
you bastards got it all wrong you guys are a bunch of feminists looking for something to go on with your agenda you are retarded and the wage gap has been illegal since  you dont take in mind that generally woman work less hours take more days off go to lower paying jobs also men for example have higher times in jail and have a higher suicide rate along with higher deaths at jobs not to mention that a lot of triggered feminists cause men even if the didnt and then ruin there lives in fact woman are probably more privileged then men i could go on for ever to be honest,1
finally someone who uses there brain,0
she wasnt very convincing as a presenter honestly i like the data though,0
when i feel weak  especially when im depressed and want fast food i watch vids like farm to fridge you have no heart if it doesnt affect you at least a little,0
thanks for this documentary  ,0
i watched the farm to fridge video i cried i dont think i want to eat meat anymore its so sad i cant eat those poor animals,0
i eat meat this is australia where i am stop with the vegan activist,0
joe the film vegan  better not say anything about vegan athletes otherwise it debunked itself automatically rogan,0
freelee is probably making a video applauding you right now,0
your not transgender transgender means that you really feel like you are the opposite gender and when your at a proper age where you or your guardians feel you can get surgery to change your genitalia also if you dont get surgery thats fine but then dont go back and forth from being feminine and masculine and continue to call yourself transgender,0
well explained and well produced,0
i simply dont understand peoples obsession with meat it makes no sense and is totally illogical on every level these morons would prefer to eat literally shit off the slaughterhouse floor pack it in sausage package and call it real than eat a healthy plant food and call it shit how is this not considered madness,0
cough cough feminist,0
the outright denial of reality that some people show in these comments is disturbing,0
so why do women chose less good paying jobs you have this question first,0
you should make a new day  proper food combining on a raw vegan diet flat belly ,0
scientists run experiments round the clock,0
i really relate to trisha in this once you become aware of the cruelty it is impossible to keep putting that pain and death in your body ,0
doesnt blocking testosterone eliminate that advantage that everyone is talking about  testosterone is what makes your body grow and function like a typical mans body hair muscle growth all that is affected by testosterone if they no longer have testosterone and now estrogen  what girls have the advantage really isnt that big,0
this isnt sexism its just common sense,0
great video keep it up,0
get the fruits as they are naturally not packaged do you realize how expensive that will be even over the course of two weeks i know youre making bank but its the principle if youre going to go for it do it in the best way possible  good luck,0
piers morgan is a bawbag is that how you say it,0
this isnt up for debate they are cheating,1
hackers be like,0
i love you  beatifull jovata from the space,0
if a guy with a penis can wake up and decide he is a girland i must respect that and treat him as a female or be called all those left wing nut sack family names then tomorrow i wanna wake up and declare myself an illegal invader alien so i can get everything for free,1
 feminists hate math,1
this why i dont join feminized because i dont want to be a villain like those women,1
u identify as a girl but are a gay man huh,0
excellent work thank you pbn all the best maeve in ireland,0
actually the  thing isnt real its been illegal to pay woman less science the s,0
girl crazy dont treat veganism as a diet go all out eat them fruits get them grains and carb the fuck up btw losing weight in veganism takes time so dont get discouraged,0
women are less aggressive in negotiating their wages bam  cents,0
transgender should compete against other transgender problem solved next issue,1
trader joes fried rice is so easy and vegan on nights when you dont feel like going out or cooking also chao brand cheese is the best in my opinion ,0
smoothies really help and are convenient for getting enough nutrition and that shit im vegan,0
please do a video on gigi gorgeous the poor animals gigi wears and eats,0
there need to be a rd class where both transgenders of each gender can compete this is nuts i thought we as a people of common sense would not see this day but how far have we fell ,0
i love breakfast and i know you love eggs and bacon so try tofu scramble hash browns bagels pancakes toast ect if you really like meat and cheese and stuff try out all the vegan replacements i like fruit and veg but you dont have to eat those things  of the time tbh im kind of a junk food vegan but i also love healthy foods dont obsess over the whole idea of dieting and just replace the things you like with vegan version,0
horses vs ferrari pretty much,0
try almond milk cashew milk or coconut milk in your coffee drinks i always prefer coconut milk in the place of regular milk it tastes better and isnt as heavy,0
why is it this titles video un spanish i happen to be a native spanish speaker but the video is in english with no subtitles in spanish so again why is it the title in spanish not complaning just wondering,0
i havent even watched video i want to be straight up and be honest i think she does have a body dysmorphia i think theres something wrong with her however i dont think she is transgender i think that shes trying to find an answer for whats wrong with her and she thinks its this i dont think shes doing it for views or to make a mockery of the community and it took me a lot to say this because i dislike her a lot,0
thank you based mom,0
totally not fair how ironic that the transgender girls are winning why is that no brainer it is like we are moving backwards in society instead of forward what women fought so hard for it is like they want to send women back as housewives with no aspirations because now the transgenders are moving in chivalry and common sense is dead,0
not to mention the rate of dangerous work spaces and work fatalities for men compared to women is much higher,0
and linda mccartney foods are full of protein and delicious some are vegan and not xx,0
everyone defending her is acting like we dont know whats going on but uh am i transgender  do i identify with my birth gender  thats literally all we need to know to say shes not trans,0
these community just full of gender stereotype pink blue pastel dark red whatever it just color just like whatever you like it have nothing to do with trans make up or not it doesnt making you be more or less girl we just dress whatever we want to feels good and comfortable about ourselves as much as how furry cant turned to be real fox from what they wear or not wear you are not gonna be more or less female just from make up too it just what you choose to wear making you feels good im a girl i love blaire but that still doesnt make me trans i just think shes so hot my sis love gays and want to be gay but thats just her fetish of yaoi i guess just being who you are love yourself wear whatever you want but if you want to cut your boobs well then you maybe trans,0
its really cool seeing girls supporting each other on the internet this video made me really happy im glad trish is on the path ,0
i dont know if it is a good thing or a bad thing but for me this is old news almost  year old news it is  and this is required to keep our structural society intact it is so sad,0
being vegan doesnt make you healthy tho you have to eat the right foods still,0
i give her props for trying  most people cant do this so good for you trish,0
this is awesome eat things like potatoes legumes and bananas dates and tofu kalespinach they give you lots of protein,0
there is no stopping the rise of veganism and environmental awareness now we will have our vegan world the nonvegans have to realise that animal agriculture is toxic to this planet is cruel unnecessary and just plain wrong and we are not going to let them destroy the animals and our planet go vegan,0
im never going vegan that doesnt mean im are a bad person i just live meat ,0
girl try gardein meats theyre soooo good,0
go trish youll never go back ,0
so if being attracted to gay guys means youre a man whats the gender for being attracted to celebrities,0
love your hair,0
this is a very simple explanation of the wage gap i had a hard time understanding before but i can see now how it does exist,0
week yeah they are dudes soooo,1
no shit they have an advantage,0
the only way to get rid of this problem is to get rid of all laws and government and kill everyone,1
im so proud of you trish,0
so proud of trish i hope it sticks ,0
protein peas kale spinach broccoli sprouts mushrooms and grains calcium dark leafy greens like kale broccoli etc,0
thank you vox for once not putting your usual political agenda ahead of the truth,0
i thought her video was incredibly disrespectful and one of the reasons why people are so turned off by our community,0
omg go trish ,0
that it aint real end of video,0
i cant even focus on what trisha is saying bc her lips are truly truly disgusting bless her heart,1
me and the wife are  months in with a plant based diet its incredible the data thats available right now and the feeling you get knowing every meal harmed no animal i feel great  im looking better these videos are so empowering and my objective is to share as much of the knowledge that im learning keep up the good work people and together we will create the world we will be proud to call our own ,0
this video basically debunked the wage gap while also still claiming that there is a wage gap what,0
and people say you turn people off being vegan  they need to look at the evidence ,0
the only way to make this video better is to have president trump narrate it feminist would be pulling their blue hair out with both hands,0
try quinoa rice potatoesbut not fried pasta,0
i just finished watching it yeahh i loved it,0
so shes both genders,0
nice to see you delete perfectly normal  respectful suggestions  disappointed,0
did you peg jason,0
trisha your body is just fine you dont need to look like her your perfect the way you are,0
you know i would hazard a guess that the reason women take lower paying jobs and work shorter less consistent hours is because of the social pressure and gender roles that dictate that they should females are encouraged to take lower paying professions because those professions are often more traditionally feminine typically female dominated areas will probably seem safer for women to take and typically male dominated areas will seem safer for men to take women may work fewer hours because they are expected to care for any children children they are expected to have,0
sooooooooo the wage gap myth is proof that girls are worse at math,1
holy crap she looks sooooo skinny her face is different,0
its not hate to assume men are faster then women transgender girls who are biologically boys will win  times its biology,0
prageru should we end the fed,0
maybe just maybe men and women are not built the same so they strive for different jobs o,0
they are straight up dudes wtf if you got a dick or ever had one then you should not be able to compete against girls,1
all i know is that the bitch is whack and shes obviously doing it for attention unless shes really that dumb ,0
im very tired as of now and what im getting out of this is that most women who are earning less are doing so because many of them have children to take care of so theyre missing hours the solution is that work hours could be made more flexible is that what shes saying here if so couldnt a better solution be to raise the wage of women with children who are singleunsupported please note that i am not very educated in this field so im just making a solution based on what ive observed from this video p,0
damn trish youve got some great curves ,0
if you want to eat junk food trisha you can find all kinds of junk food in vegan version dont think vegan is a restrictive diet btw i believe you can do it,0
what do you tell a woman with one black eye nothing you already told her once what do you tell a woman with two black eyes nothing you already told her twice,1
lol shes trolling calm down this isnt new,0
yes trisha dont forget lots and lots of water aim for a gallon a day to help clear your skin for your video and to remove toxins,0
this is so strange that a female wants to be a trans male to female cuz she hits on gay men should she not want to be a man,0
sounds like a personal problem to me,0
so the new type of sports categories are male and coed gotcha,1
i kinda hope more notable people go carnivore because the moment they suffer life threatening heart disease or diabetes and people find out that will virtually be the end of the carnivore diet,0
screw the fem movement put on your bra and get in the kitchen,1
find the firm that is breaking the law and than we will talk,0
not suprided they are blackmen hell something must be in their food just too many black men turning gay the last  decades,1
go girl just make sure you eat enough dont stuff yourself obviously just eat til youre full and if you want a snack have a snack i think alot of people fail because they dont eat enough and dont change up what theyre eating so it gets boring  which it isnt and shouldnt be im so proud of you and i wish you all the best ,0
omg i have never been so excited and hopeful for the future of our planet,0
freelee gon make a vid for sure excited,0
question about the math at  k is roughly  of k so women earn  less right,0
 and men negotiate their salary more often and with better results than women,0
subscribe to my channel i will be uploading videos of my body and the process,0
no sis no bro either way no this was not the move,0
this was really the best one i have watched,0
for going vegan try to stick with whole foods as much as possible for the best results eat lots of vegetables like piles of vegetables and eat lots of fruit too a great way to get protein in lentils and beans also edamame pasta or black bean pasta is very high in protein there are also vegan protein powders and tofu and setian which is a made from wheat and lentlis and red beans this product is very high in protein there is tempeh too and also nutritional yeast also high in protein is chia seeds is around  grams or so protein for  tablespoons even though its high protein ist also high in fats its a good fat but for plant based diet you want to keep your fat low dont consume too much of it i hope this was helpful and i hope your journey is successful  ive eben vegan for  weeks now and i keep my protein high because i lift and want to keep my musle and i dont really low fat so far it works for me ,0
yassss trisha iim so proud of u i really hope u do well,0
smoothies and green juices are awesome also flax seeds  chia seeds are so good for you and you can still buy vegan meals and just check the ingredients for dairy etc also vegan blogs have amazing recipes being vegan really isnt that hard if you think about the animals i really hope you stay vegan because its changed my life,0
if you have a veggie grill in la go there everyday lol its basically a burger joint but everything is vegan and it will give you ideas for meals you can cook at home ,0
i would say that this wont even bother me but now i have a little girl so its kind of scary,0
all the oreo varieties are vegan  so is doritos spicy sweet chili so even vegans can be fatties and eat some junk ps im vegan i love it,0
the wage gap shrinks but its still there,0
honestly ive always gotten male vibes from you so i hope this is true and not clickbait,0
blair was problematic in the past but a bitch has grown and we stand for her wokeness ,0
not to mention most of the incredibly rich people in the us are men celebrities ceos etc all making above k a year drastically impacts the average,0
ill take my statistics from actual universities sorry,0
im a vegan  and healthy ,0
what a beyond awesome video i am a  years vegan lady and i love this loving lifestyle vegan for all  for gods beautiful animals for us gods children and for gods planet too lets open thyeye  god gave us words he especially gave us one important word that is shared with me ,0
trish i sent you an email i hope you find it  ness in australia  ,0
this is amazing freelee lets all support trish in her journey ,0
you got this girl im so proud of you as much as you hated it watch more footage it helps with the transition if youre struggling check out bite size vegan channel if you dont wanna see anything graphic check out her video series for kids,0
first of all if you know trisha you know that she is definitely just shitposting and unfortunately for her its completely blown up and gone too far and now shes cant turn back without being completely cancelled second of all i find it shocking the way the lgbtq community prestigious members of the community have reacted to the news the way most people have reacted to her completely contradicts to what they normally preach about transgender people they will allow predators to convince themselves and others that they can get periods and pms even though they have male genitalia  but when a known troll comes out suddenly theyre offended i know trisha just as well as the next person but what if she actually does have gender dysphoria and this is how the hypocrites that are social justice warriors react if anything shes exposing the hypocrisy within the lgbtq online community,0
what drugs is trish on legit im curious to see what her drug screen would look likemeth cocaine pcp shes the definition of an annoying attention seeking white girl ,1
is this a troll video,0
i drink orgain vegan protein shake in the morning you should try those they are delicious and its g of protein,0
the poeticness of there being a trump advertisement before this video,0
you might be right put that waythe narrower gap makes sense but lets not pretend that some of those choices arent influenced by some social cultural and religious beliefs that tend to favor men,0
i want to do one of the worst jobs and one of the best then again i would probably do most of those and i love science,0
watch what i eat vids by lovekyliie easy simple vegan and she has a body to die for,0
i dont know why youre all so shook the other month she was an opiate addict and somehow made an overnight recovery from withdrawal tomorrow she will probably say that shes related to the queen and that she had an incest relationship with prince harry,0
if it was a man explaining the video there would be so much rage in the comments,0
cant wait for the debunkers that will tear this narrative apart lies and fud masters at work here this is a propaganda blitz first extinction rebellion then game changers and now this bullshit vegan dont fall for it people its just another attempt to control the population listen to alan savory and the proponents of regenerative farming we need more cows and ruminants to heal the earth and produce the food of the world,1
nice video glad to seem some wider analysis on this issue rather than just complaining about the outcome,0
there is now wage gap this is just more feminist propaganda,1
this is only a common thing that is brought up when talking about equality because it is misnamed a name that better suits this is a earnings gap because that is what it is theyre not paid a different wage for the same work they just earn less because of their actions,0
you can try mashrooms they are full of proteins i know vegan butter milk chocolate etc exist so you can try those,0
yikes really cant tell when trisha is trolling if she is i guess its poking fun at transtrenders but i think thats really reaching here huh,0
i am a trans male i know how gender dysphoria works and everything and it is different for everyone and listening to this video i would not say any of this makes you a trans male usually someone will not go  as female and male when trans if youre gender fluid or anything else like that yes maybe but trans ftm no so maybe youre gender fluid i dont wanna somehow invalidate you in any way but watching this video me and my other trans ftm friends feel invalidated and hurt by this and this will just be a way people can make fun of and invalidate the community here,0
potatoesricegreensblend them in smoothies so they taste goodfruit for days way to go btw,0
but shes on snapchat right now eating chicken and waffles ,0
blaire nooooo shes doing this for attention shes desperate for it deny her ass,0
yes this is so exciting i am praying that you stick with it so proud of you darling,0
this doesnt surprise me just irritates me because shes already hit rock bottom when it comes to mental health now shes just being toxic ,1
the wage gap statistic is invalid because it does not take into account education years of experience and hours worked so please tell me why you still think this is true,0
its an old video shes already eating nonvegan again her music video is already out,0
go go trish ,0
first of all congratulations your body wont magically transform in two weeks but youll feel so much better and youll see differences in your skin and overall health before i went vegan i struggled with multiple eating disorders i still struggle but the vegan lifestyle lets you eat in abundance which your body wants because the food you eat is your energy stay carbed up of course but also drink plenty of water at first i started to replace animal products with vegan products such as almond milk go veggie cheese earth balance vegan butter bagels daiya cream cheese boca burgers boca chicken patties gardien orange chickn oatmeal with maple syrup  peanut butter and vegan cereals humans are addicted to dairy and cheese so replacing them with a vegan option helps curve the cravings although all the food i mentioned is vegan junk food i just wanted to let you know that there is literally a vegan option for anything and that youre not missing out xo good luck,0
if you read the study they misrepresented the information,0
its embarassing that we actually have to make videos like these its so basic and logical why would you only look at the factor gender when analyzing complex things its so obvious,0
i am so so so proud of trish omg this makes me so happy,0
eat lots of sweet potatoes and eat the skin its loaded with vitamins eat some greens like kale or spinach you can mix them into smoothies and you fruit to mask the taste if you dont like it also make sure you drink some kind of plant milk for calcium try to avoid soy love you trish good luck   ,0
ik this is a vegan topic based video but you have to think of overpopulation and how to control it so instead of abused mass produced farm raised animals people who choose to eat meat could hunt for what they and their families consume its way better than all the wasteful ways of the meat production and its low in cruelly because the animals would develop in nature this would be hunting for survival purposes not trophy hunting,0
womens sports is officially ruined,1
trish  stop stop,0
im so proud of you trish i hope you fall in love with the lifestyle i found with the whole eat as much as you want it depends on how you exercise you can gain weight being vegan if you dont exercise along with eating a ton make sure you eat enough calories ,0
as far as frappuccinos go i mean theyre not healthy but if you want one every once in a while there are vegan options the actual base of all fraps is dairy free whether youre getting a coffee base or cream base or you can swap out the regular base for soy milk if you want you just have to focus on the flavour portion and skip anything with dairy example nothing chocolate and no caramal drizzle and obviously no whipped cream if you get the light version of any frap it automatically contains dairy so frappuccinos you can still get coffee mocha oprah chai espresso green tea strawberries and crme,0
this is sick they are guys i dont care what they feel those poor girls work their ass off only to be beaten by men now those freaks go onto further competition while the girls stay home,1
i personally think that a good portion of the actual wage gap comes from men being more aggressive when it comes to requesting raises and are willing to over compensate when wanting the raise my wife for one was fine with just being a crew member i encouraged her to work harder and show her employers that she is worth more than what they are paying her within  months she was offered shift lead and i continued to boost her confidence and pushed her to stay on top of things giving her advice on how to prove herself she pushed and worked harder she out shined most of her co workers with in a year she was made management i helped her develop the tools needed to excel and succeed in the job she liked i encourage her and stand behind her whenever she feels that she isnt doing good enough and help her reach the stars because she means so much to me and i can see that her success makes her happy she never would have accomplished so much with out a mans outlook to guide her not saying she would have eventually gotten the position on her own but she would have taken much much longer the way she was handling it she is strong without me but she is even stronger with me we are partners and she outshines me now and i am so proud of her,0
i feel like an important choice this video skirts around is the choice to be a mother we as a country dont have laws protecting maternity rights also clarification i am not a feminist i find the idea degrading and counterintuitive i am however a deontologist who values all people,0
imagine if this were a man talking even though the points would be exactly the same the opposing side would totally smite down the ideas the videos make fighting identity politics at their own game nice,0
you can do it trish ,0
so basically the summary of this video is that wage gap exists because women work fewer hours with less paid time periods because they have children and because they tend to gravitate toward jobs with lower pay in other words men dont earn more because they are men but because they work more,0
prageru is smart they find the facts double and triple check them then they get someone who you wouldnt expect to present the information they dont get a white male talk about racism they get a black female whos seen the facts and believes them they get a female to talk about sexism it makes it harder to argue against them because people cant attack the speaker for being sexist racist or privileged it avoids ad hominem arguments being used against them and makes the facts look more credible,0
part of being an educational venue is presenting the facts and allowing the audience to draw the most reasonable conclusion prager university sets a mandate on what youre allowed to think right at the title,0
umm lion tamer  at the end,0
trisha love and praise goes to you honey,0
this bitch dumb ,1
try mangos just try a bunch of stuff vegetable stir fry everything go to the vegan restaurants around la,0
this video made me smile,0
thank god im too lazy to do any of this stuff,0

thank you  now i dunderstand,0
who else came here to just see the feminists comments,0
good foods to eat grains rice quinoa whatever you like all the fruit in the world potatoes huge smoothies with spinach cuz u cant taste the spinach acai bowls hash browns no oil stay away from oil in general its very concentrated bad calories but potatoes are good calories oatmeal with bananas frozen blueberries and maple syrup is so good beans like chickpeas are so good on rice and stuff i like making mine with potatoes in the beans and tomato sauce and spices and then topping everything off with corn vegan tacos vegetable sushi spring rolls and baked potatoes if you want to lose weight remember whole food and low fat if you want to save animals as long as its veeg youre good,0
just to let you know there are vegans who watch your videos and like you we dont all judge people negatively i have been watching your videos for a long time and i support you,0
what happened to your instagram i cant find it,0
if only mentally retarded waste of oxygen subhuman filthy vile degenerate overused cumguzzling gutter sluts called feminists had the braincells to understand what this vid is talking aboutif only,1
these choices and behaviors are being influenced by social expectations so there may not be an actual paying wage gap but there are still gender roles that hinder people from reaching their full potential,0
yes there is a gap between your legs american women are worthless good for nothing spoiled twats,1
 thats the stupidest chart ive ever seen,0
you need to eat vegetables but you dont like vegetables ,0
theyre men ofcourse theyll be at an advantage against women,0
omg how does anyone with any gray matter process this ,0
omg this made me so happy trish i totally get the chicken finger thing and gardein a plant based meat brand makes the best fake chicken fingers ,0
you are not trans you are an attention whore period,1
this is a puff piece supporting these twothe parents being allowed to ask is if fair if they cant compete but nobody asking the question is it fair for girls born as girls if these two compete against them notice the news reporter asks when did you decide when it was appropriate for you to join the girls track teamshe assumes its appropriatei dont think it is the news isnt newsits carefully crafted opinionput in a package for the masses to consumepoison that goes down smooth with a spoonful of honey,0
can someone please correct me if im wrong so there is no such thing as a wage gap however there is an income gap and this is based on choice people make with women birthing babies and all mostly staying home or only working part time hence earning an income equal to c for ever male dollar and there is no job that a women actually gets paid less then a man for the same work just looking for some clarification is all,0
ive been watching you since  months ago and i had no idea you had such a cute ginger cat  noice in other news trisha is grabbing at straws for attention as a grown ass woman when will she stop,0
people who are trans in these comments are saying your not trans this is offensive like if your for loving who you want to love and being who you want to be why are you telling her what she is or isnt she cant help the way she feels if someone told you you werent trans i bet youd be pissed,0
trish needs to get a good road bike if she want the tone tummy the diet goes with the cycling and there are plenty of hills around her to ride up in a granny gear,0
im a vegan  percent but im also a carnivore ,0
trish i love grapes but freeze them and they taste like ice cream ,0
i hope you see this trisha  you need vegetables like potatoes beans lentils kale and brocoli they all can be soo good you should check out pintrest for vegan recipes,0
women are more likely than men to accept a lower salary im guessing id like to see a study done on the differences if any in willingness and ability to negotiate for a higher salary as well as employers willingness to accept or decline requests for a raise based on gender,0
so basically tomboy and girly ,0
this is still false,0
what people miss about the gender wage gap the gender wage gap because it doesnt exist,0
legumes beans  lentils and grains rice quinoa kaniwa etc and healthy fats avocado nuts  seeds look up whole food plant based diet,0
it doesnt exist in fact in many jobs females make more,0
as next you should try low carb high fat diet d,0
god gave very good directions on what to eat do any of you read your or my bible,0
this is a fucking joke fuck trans people,1
off topic but those nails are so pretty,0
i agree with this video but the hiring only women argument is a bad one as that itself would be called discrimination and would not be allowed in extreme circumstances under us law,0
this woman is a genius,0
there is no wage gap due to sexism if you work hard enough youll make the same,0
if your going to be a raw vegan ya go ahead small in all the calories you can but if your eating bowls of rice all day its not going to help you loose weight fruits and veggies are low in calories and you can eat as much as you want of them until you get full but anything else you should have in moderation i would try some vegan places out so it spieces things up and you can get some ideas of what you can make for yourself,0
i think this is kind of a borderline episode moment for trisha i just really wish it didnt have to be published for the world to see ,0
seems that one study which was omitted is should be obvious that one which cites the fact that the greatest single explanation for the gap is the fact that women give birth to children and are more involved in raising them if fact when this factor is factored out the wage gap favors women it is much easier for women to exit and reenter the labor force than men women have a much greater number of occupations which are easier for them to exit and reenter than men women simply have many more employment options generally than men the wage gap is mostly a function of the fact that most men are employed continuously whereas that is less likely for most women,0
same thing happened when that guy beat the crap out of a girl in the mma so bad that he cracked her skull and gave her a concussion if youre gonna be unfair and use your natural born male testosterone to your advantage like this against women then it would be fair to make leagues for just them theyre ruining it for the women league now,1
yes there is it is simple math,0
i love you two you guys together are such an amazing mix x,0
women dont work overtime equally with men,0
wage gaps cant melt steel beams,0
you also forgot that they dont work as hard they work less hours and take longer vacations wether or not they had kids,1
cringyest moment greta thornburg quit exploiting that little girl and her mental illness,1
no more yummy food videos  gutted,0
 year out of business school lol,0
so proud of you trish you can try oatmeal for breakfast with maple syrup and berries for dinner there sre great vegan burgers rice and salad la is good for vegans i live in norway and its really hard but you can always go to veggie grill or something this will be good for you love you,0
reality check doesnt exist,0
my teacher was like there is a gender wage gap point black period women get payed less for the same job and im just like wtf how if everyone gets payed the same wage per hour the only way thats true is if women work less hours and thats nobodies fault,0
about  wankers watched this,0
ok so ive been vegan for a few months and im  and my mom keeps telling me that i have an eating disorder because i dont eat enough protein because i dont eat dead animals she is taking me to get my blood tested and everything because im not restricting and just being healthy i dont know what to do please help,0
some of the videos prageru publish are misleading and i always wonder why im still subscribe to these guys these videos and many others are the reason why good job prageru and keep up the goodwork,0
my mom became a vegeterian decades ago when it wasnt yet a thing when we went out for dinner and my mom asked for a vegeterian not yet vegan menu she earned pityfull sights poeple kept asking if she had a medical condition no she had not she just did not want to eat slaughtered animals yet she was concerend about me having enough proteins back then medical diet recommendations always included meat and dairy so i had to eat them on a regular basis today i feel freed went vegan a year ago after a vegeterian phase with dairy and fish and never felt as healthy as now,0
conclusion a  minute video of her saying ,0
yaaasssss trish you can do it there are so many different vegan foods that you can eat look some recipes online there are plenty of things you can eat ,0
the only word that needs to come after wage gap is myth vox is fake news,0
thats cheating get it through your head ,1
shes tooooolin she does this all the time to get people talking about her obviously it works she actually said in the past that thats what she does,0
i really think this is going to cause women to not participate in sports anymore whats the point if you know youre gonna lose anyways,0
transgenders should compete alongside other transgenders secondly transgenders do have an advantage their muscle capacity is that of a male which is stronger than the muscle capacity of a female,1
nowadays people use the word troll very loosely not a lot of people know what it means anymore so it was very nice for trisha to remind us,0
having a bad experience being a woman does not mean ur transgender dude being a woman is tuff we get a lot of shit we have to deal w so much that men dont have to so i get wanting to escape being a woman but i think this stems from a place of self hatred and self esteem issues rather than being transgender i think youd feel so sad and lost if you transitioned my  cents xoxo,0
shut up please,0
or watch the video where freelee challenges shane she talks about vegan places near shanes house and i guess escuse me if im wrong you live near by ,0
this is amazing,0
dont know why im here but i cant stop watching this train wreck ,0
i dont think shes trolling but i dont think shes trans either i think she has some kind of personality disorder shes always trying to be other people shes never fine with who she is,0
no feminists are going to believe this if a mans the one taking in this video oh wait feminists arent even going to believe this,0
this makes absolutely no fucking sense just stop,1
if you watch her snaps she is eating non vegan,0
omg im soooo proud of you trisha i love this,0
i think trishas veganism might last  days,0
as long as everyone is being payed fairely for their job why do you want to close the medium pay gap,0
trisha is clearly just a super lost person shes grabbing onto anything and everything to feel acceptance shes the definition of hotmess whos way too involved in internet fame its all she has and this is just sad its also super wrong though you cant just jump on something thats so serious as another thing to get you validation when so many are going through a real struggle that people need to support,0
if i was running a business and could get away with paying women less why couldnt i just pay everyone lower more profit for me right,0
just went over to trishas video and commented vegan foods that have protein ,0
you are an idiot jesus christ,1
holy hell shes ugly without makeup she literally has pig features,0
i dont think she wanted to offend anyone i just think she wanted the attention that she always gets from her other vedios but shes not a trans,0
this is why i love her yeah she has had her bitchy moments but she is here to help people go vegan and the only prof you need is the smile on her face throughout the whole video,0
please dont strictly follow freelees diet watch vegan gains video he just uploaded about you going vegan and check out what he has to say oh and btw thumbs up for trying a vegan diet,0
make sure to get some actually satiating foods like pasta and beans so youre not only eating fruit also you can add tvp to things for more protein also make smoothies with lots of greens,0
for protein nuts and beans or good good snacks that are vegan are regular lays chip fruits and vegetables granola barsand smoothies,0
if you want to put a quick stop to the gender earnings gap you ought to immediately and completely free up the markets and allow capitalism to thrive if a business pays people any less than they deserve that person leaves their job whenever possible to get better benefits somewhere else you pay a person too much your competitors can run more efficiently than you then and top your profits you might worry that structural sexism would throw a wrench in this system not to worry market forces are very robust against bigotry because again the company that pays its employees based exactly on how hard they work will outcompete and outemploy startups from locally to internationally the worst thing you can possibly do to exacerbate an earnings gap is to give subsidies to certain corporations and make unions and employment restrictions if a ceo entrepreneur worker or business as a whole earns money from subsidies welfare or union dues all of which are illegal to not contribute to these funds are socializedforcefully taken from citizens they have no reason to pay their employees fairly or price products fairly they dont need to work hard at all to earn this perverted capital yet it seems so many who decry this gap are more interested in collectivist egalitarian ownership of wages rather than allowing people basic property rights and the ability to get employed where they want to youll compromise against actual solutions towards the gap every single time which demonstrates you really dont care about this issue at all,0
going plant based is great but it also doesnt mean healthy eating boxed or frozen vegan foods is still unhealthy make sure youre eating as many raw fruits and vegetables as possible and also go carb i highly recommend high carb low fat veganism,0
your into was so cute and funny omg ilysm,0
i might be crazy but anyone else understand trish here and doesnt think she is trolling everything she said can be proved she has always been attached to gay guys she always had lgbtq friends she does either dress up like a drag queen or just roll out of bed i think she just shouldnt label what she is and just go for what she likes,0
women arent much of a hard workers  they like money but hard work isnt much of a thrill for them,0
the title says there is no gender wage gap then it goes on to explain there is indeed a wage gap smh,0
do you know what gender dysphoria is,0
i did that  week challenge   months vegan now lol ,0
hahahah the feminist narrative of wage gap is slowly falling apart thank god this lie has limited time left for vox this was actually a pretty fair video they touch on the main topics of why women on average earn less,0
i love this woman,0
blaire i find you to be very likeable ive tended to be judgy toward the trans concept but i like you a lot and appreciate you keepin it ,0
kids are running the world now lol i never thought i would see the day smh sports can get very competitive what happens if a full blown brawl occurs these boys against girls lol the story will change they are selfish because their parents are selfish they are not being excluded but they are selfishly pushing others with natural born rights to a certain title to the side smh,1
please dont listen to this its fake,0
either way everyone loves their mother and no amount of money can pay for that,0
transgender taking over womens rightsyeaa its a mans wold lol,1
ok so trasha is now a transgender black chicken nugget addict,0
ive been telling people that  cent bullshit is a totally misleading statistic for years,0
trish posted on snapchat and instagram that she was eating chicken and waffles guess her vegan diet didnt last long,0
well done ,0
sooooo boring but probobly good to know,0
she also failed to mention how its just a gap in work out in not salary of the job women still get paid the same as men for the same hours and work put in,0
when a woman has a child she becomes a mother so how could the father provide more then the mother a woman provides different love than a man thats just how it is sorry to say but men and women are simply not equal in velpoe never ever be equal women have babies men do not have babies,0
this made my day,0
thats so fucked up where are womens rights now,0
i am so proud of you for saying what is on your mind even when you dont have to,0
blaire can i havs some advice im currently identifying with genderfluid due to me feeling okay mostly with being a girl but honestly for some reason my name which is very girly bugs me i love cute skirts and dresses and femininity but i hate my birthname i feel weird about having a chest and i really wouldnt mind being a dude part of me wishes i could be im a cosplayer and it makes me so happy to cosplay in general l but one cosplay that was a boy my age boosted my confidence more than you could ever understand getting the your so handsome comments always makes me feel better than pretty ive gotton increaseing more uncomfortable with being called daughter or neice over the years am i just genderfluid or am i trans i feel like i dont want fo be trans and i feel like that may be contributing to the confusion i wanna be called and socially be a boy or just not a girl but i dont wanna be trans idk im confused,0
im so proud of you trisha,0
as long as you make me a sandwich,0
seems like a defeatist mindset then theres all of those magical variables no one can define in the end the gap still exists either way which defeats the supposed premise of the video this one seems odd,0
its not because youre lazy jays just have different priorities in life theyre taking time off of work to raise kids and do special things with them when men tend to stay and work to make money thats not sexist thats just a fact,0
i can agree that flexible hours would help however who stays home with the kids is a decision couples make maybe women need to insist on working as many hours in their jobs as their husbands additionally you broke this down into  simple categories  which didnt even go into trade jobs or labor jobs rather than specific jobs an example oncologists and neurosurgeons or any surgeon is going to make more money by far than a general physician some one with a social science degree who goes into business is going to earn less money than a person with a degree in economics or straight up business this is because more people go into the field of social science than business hours worked is another factor the more hours you work  even on a salary job the more likely  all other things being equal that you will either get a raise or a promotion it also seems that men are more likely to ask for a raise than women or take the risk of leaving one job for another there are a lot of things which play into the earnings gap and it is an earnings gap not a wage gap same job worked same hours same number of years yields a far smaller or even nearly zero difference in pay it is imo disingenuous to call this a  wage gap,0
this is so good im lost for words,0
is been proven time and time again that men have a physical advantage over women nothing sexist about it that is just plain facts of science and nature i dont care that they have gone through hormone therapy they even said in the video that everybodys body responds differently if there was no advantage what is it just a coincidence that they always finish one and two  i think not these parents say that all they care about is their childs wellbeing very hard to believe they are promoting distructive behavior and mental illness ,1
 of the people who disliked are angry feministsthe other  are idiotssad but true,0
she was only vegan for like  days she ate chicken and waffles on her snapchat,0
one of the moms they naturally have testosterone in thier bodies female ovaries produces high amounts of estrogen and small amounts of testosterone learn your facts kids,0
my first halloween in la was in weho i saw the most incredibly gorgeous men like absolutely beautiful i thought i was in heaven it took me a while to realize what was going on there was gay people in my small town but i wasnt really around the community growing up so when i found the community i fell in love high school musical looking muscular emotional in touch men it was confusing as fuck to me that they were with other men i was confused about myself i was so tall and had a large build and felt masculine sometimes especially next to some of these extremely feminine gay men i thought i was a lesbian for the longest time i thought feeling masculine equates to me liking woman i was attracted to woman but i was not a lesbian i fell for my gay male best friends it was hard not to they understood me i thought maybe i was male inside sometimes but chose to present female years later ive dated mostly men ive had sexual relations with both but none of thatin the end really has anything to do with feeling masculine im biologically female who has some masculine emotions traits and physical attributes at times i am female and so is trisha,0
it doesnt matter if its  cent or  cent its still not fair to women i have female friends in the work place that get paid less than men its hapoeninb in my school it doesnt matter if its one cent it still can make a big difference,0
bravo what a wonderful production this gave me with hope that we are bounding closer and closer to a time when most people will see compassionate eating as the way to go,0
awesome video blaire greetings from vancouver bc your stuff is still showing up on my youtube feed dont worry,0
hasnt she tried to go vegan several times now idgi,0
those are  dudes,1
if youre going raw u need more fruit girl lol,0
just some advice if youre going to try eating a vegan diet dont just eat fruit and veg or your going to get bored and go straight back to your old diet  you need to get creative you can just search vegan recipes on yt and loads will come up i definitely recommend looked at kalels videos on what she eats because she creates amazing recipes,0
honestly if this isnt a troll then her ramblings sound like someone having an identity crisis someone that doesnt fit in anywhere and everyone is kind of against her no one really accepts her anywhere by her own fault of her trolling and being an idiot so shes trying to find something to explain her confusion with who she is and where she fits in the world again by the  chance shes not trolling,1
yayyyy trisha i used to be against vegans and hated that they used you in videos to make you go vegan but  weeks ago i watched knives over forks and i went vegan just like that its the best thing ive ever done and ive lost kg in  weeks and i literally eat so much and whenever i want go trish xx,0
simply eat whole vegetablesfruits and your carbohydrates and reduce fat and quit eating meat drinking milk and consuming dairy products  you dont need these fancy products that taste like meat you dont even need that yummy taste just give your body what it needs to be healthy and live an active life a plant based diet can even reduce the risk or heal chronical diseases like arteriosclerosis or diabetes tipe  dr michael greger so lets all stop eating junk food and start intelligent eating ,0
i think the term for what you are describing is actually demifluid and i support you if thats the case using caps so you can hear me over the hate comments d,0
youve gone too far now trisha youve completely lost my respect dude im sorry but this is just so fkn disrespectful,0
k dislikes jesus people are stupid,0
vox finally catching on to reality,0
i replace chickedmeat with tofu because it has the same amout of protein and nuts have a lot of protein ,0
the voice at the end sounds like doctor pig,0
shaving your hair off i mean you already do music videos like brittney spears so why not ,0
also in the first four months of going vegan i lost lbs without any exercise so youll definitely slim down,0
im  getting  that  that bitch tee  right  now bitch  yaass,1
good luck i went vegan for a week its rough,0
you look like a butthole and spam screwed without protection and youre the mistake they tried to abort,1
why do you want to make vegan sausage rolls making veggies substitute for meat why nobodys trying to make bacon taste like broccoli i wonder why dont you,0
shes attracted to gay dudes most girls are gay dudes dont wanna fuck them and creep on them also im pretty sure the guy from queer eye is just gay when queer eye was popular the word queer was just a insulting slur for gay people,0
frozen fruit smoothies with pb,0
im a man but i hate masculinity,0
dont starve yourself you can seriously ,0
youve outklaused yourselves once again brilliantly done ,0
trish i love you i really do but you and i and all your viewers know this will never stick yea you might last  or  days but once that intense hunger sets in and your craving dairy or meatsighyou go thru these phases and they never last i do wish you the best tho but we all know this will never last and once you make a video of you eating meat or whatever your gonna get all this hate you do this stuff to yourself i think if you wanna do something positive just keep it to yourself so when you fail you wont receive hate from the internet just trying to help big hugs ,0
omg omg finally the video ive been waiting for,0
please just make sure you eat lots  people usually dont last going vegan because they dont eat enough also youre going to crave dairy alot but its okay  the first few days going vegan is hard i had headaches and stuff just from the detox but now i feel amazing  you just gotta push through it and youll be okay  im so proud of you trish,0
men were earning k while women were earning  percent less  k vox you are just making the whole misrepresentation worse  is  lower than  im sure  sounds much more convenient for you to make a point and surprise people but this is something that is taught in primary school  is  lower than   is  higher than  please dont try to educate people if you cant or dont want to get even this right,0
i have five points about the wage gap  if it were really true why woulnt companies just hire all women instead of men and make an additional  in profits for their share holders i am sure no one would complain if a company hired all women in fact it would be celebrated as a trail blazer  do we think that every plumber the vast majority of them are men by the way in new york gets paid the exact same amount for unclogging a toilet if not there is a wage gap  why is it not your responsibility to know what you are worth and negotiate what you think is fair if you get what you think you are worth there is no wage gap if you dont know or underestimate your worth it is your problem the last time i checked indentured labor is against the law so if you are not paid what you are worth it is your responsibility to find another job that pays you a fair wage  some people both men and women will accept less than the market wage in order to compensate for their lack of experience or education it is an opportunity for them to join the workforce and prove their worth this is essential for competition keeping wages in check and giving people a chance to enter their profession of choice  what are we doing about the wage gap between blacks  whites asians  nonasians vegetarians  nonvegetarians muslims  christians or any other classification of people we can think of,0
women making that kind of money is disgusting thats way too much for them to be earning,1
i talk to my friends and they dont care about anything except eating more meatand there in lies the problem and i believe most people simply do not want to stop eating meat regardless of the health issues and they certainly dont give a crap about the planetprobably easier to reign in our rogue federal government than to stop meat eatingand you know we cant stop the out of control crooked fed gov,0
how much do you want to bet  of dislikes on this are but hurt feminists and the other  are white knights who have never been layed,0
feminists we are gonna stop sexism by using sexism me defuq,0
maybe gigi is trolling and just wants everyone to start calling trisha a man ,0
men were earning an average salary of  while women were earning  less  on average hint  is not  less than  the phrase youre looking for is women were earning just  of that or women were earning  less if youre going to make a video on economics at least try to get basic math right,0
i cant believe you are walking around free you should be locked up for your safety and the safety of others isnt there anyone who cares just a little bit about you who will step in and make sure you get the in depth psychiatric help you are crying out for its like watching a plane crash in really slow motion,1
so early its kind of weird  love you trish,0
you can still be fat and vegan if you eat garbage just sayin if you cant eat healthy on meat you wont eat healthy on vegan lifestyle either,1
people have such weird ideologies,0
 is not  less it is  less at least get your math right,0
i want to identify as a transgender cripple so i can compete in the special olympics and if you argue otherwise your a racist bigot and intolerant,0
trisha you have got to try silk soy yogurt and chao cheese both are amazing,0
i met this man who was in the street letting people stroke this baby goat he was holding i asked him what he does and why he has the goat and he is an animal rights activist that guy in one day the day i saw him at about pm had already saved over  horses from being slaughtered he is actually wealthy but lives in a tiny house so that he can own his farm where he keeps animals and lets them die of natural causes and never mistreats them i want to be just like that man when i grow up,0
one solution a unique salary worldwide  political included,0
are we going to die becase people are going to say plants need to have rights to and we eat nothig,0
i dont think saying fing so many times in your videos is a healthy vegan talking can you stop using that word except this i like your videos,0
maybe try a pixie cut with your real hair if you felt confident with that short wig,0
gender war in the comments warning scroll down if you dare,0
so its more so a difference in choices and earnings the wage gap is merely an earnings gap and has nothing to do with sexism or inequality,0
i found a solution to all of this men will help close the wage gap and women a keep the thigh gap problem solve,0
so youre basically telling us that the wage gap is because of womens choices,0
that means no chicken fries lol love you,0
wish i could see some feminist commenting ,0
this is a complex issue yes gender discrimination happens and yes women are probably paid less than a man because of their sex however there are many things that contribute to the  for a  a man makes some of it is measurable such as education but some of it you cant measure the best way is to take a company with roughly the same experience same college education and than performance indicators to indicate if their is a true gender income inequality right wing will tell you it doesnt exist left will tell you it does but how many will admit its somewhere in the middle its probably not nearly as bad as the left portrays but it does exist probably in the tiniest amount,0
your cat is adorable,0
do i think im transgenderabsolutely do i identify with my natural born gender  trisha k,0
lets help end this gap created by free will what lmao,0
cant wait to see all the angry commenters ,0
thank you so much for this film you have raised a new passion for me to continue fighting for veganism,0
go vegan for survival of all living things,0
its interesting how even after taking everything into consideration there is still a gap and this gap is shown to be something for women to be grateful for like yeah its only a  gap so yall feminists better sit yo ass down why is there any gap why is everyone rejoicing saying that theyve got the feminists there shouldnt be a gap,0
basmati rice is my favourite kind of rice its so good,0
you go girl,0
vegan chilli canned or make it yourself over vegan buttered white rice with vegan cornbread white rice with baked tator tots on top with some light organic soy sauce and siracha plain white rice with beans with avocodo add fresh salsa if you need more flavour sweet cherry tomatoes  baby carrots and hummis dip pasta with marinera sauce plain or with sauteed mushrooms or squash oatmeal with almond milk with bannans and berries inside fruit smothies with almond milk avocado toast bocca burgers you can still eat all this and lose weight if you substitute one of your meals with fruit i left out salads and too much veggies cuz i know your not too fond of those and i want your diet to be succsesful and maintainable,0
 feminists possibly including men trying to get laid disliked this video,0
donald trump hates political correctness and comes off strong thats ehat thid country needs freelee educates on veganism in a strong manner um she doesnt have to be so pushy and insensitive,0
take note women  men arent worth a fart,0
please make a video reacting to trishas recent video,0
yeeeeees soooooo true,0
looks like im never going to texas ,0
made a youtube channel just to like this video thank you pbn,0
ps was anyone else patiently waiting on her transforming into the thumbnail ,0
cant let my wife see this video ,0
lmfaooo that intro,0
am i transgender yes do i identify as my my birth gender female yes me bitch the fuck,1
blaire i have bin your fan from year one love you lots but i am a str man with a transgender in my family with whom i am vary close and now going wtf  was it not stated that gender is a feeling  and she did say i feel not trying to be a ass just rely confused,0
maam youre in a mcdonalds drive throu,0
so essentially it once again boils down to personal choices,0
but what causes that small difference in pay we know it cannot be gender discrimination because we have the equal pay act which makes it illegal to be paid differently in identical circumstances so are the men being paid more because they have more education or job experience human capital that was not talked about in this video,0
stop circumcising your progeny and life will be better for both of you,0
im pretty sure the left is against common sense too,1
watching atm the speech at  with the sounds of pigs screaming game me the worst shivers ever such a powerful editing,0
yo honestly im always one of those batches being like guys cmon ts trishbut what is she doing,0
maybe the best paying majors are mostly male because women cant get into those fields because of sexism in the job field,0
im so happy your trying out veganism make sure your eating a lot of whole plant food and carb the fuck up just a warning your face will probably break out a lot the first two weeks because your body is detoxing,0
ohh my gwwdd please just talk slowww,0
our fires are being intentionally started they want us all off of our land and want to move us into stack and pack apartment buildings so they can keep us all under control we will not be able to farm on our own anymore i am vegan but i also believe this is an evil agenda  yes plants are great but i dont believe we can get all of our nutrients from plants i have to supplement also our crops are being sprayed with glyphosate ruining our gut health,1
trisha trying so hard to stay relevant lol,0
who came here to see the comments,0
heres the answer to your bullshit wage gap women have jobs that are not as hard to complete as what men will do they do the easy jobs then expect to get paid like a man working construction when have you ever seen a woman working on the job site laying bricks or shoveling dirt at a construction job never thats just an example it goes for more then just construction like my example was,0
beans nuts brown rice or quinoa sweet potatoes peas and dark leafy greens have a lot of protein and keep you full fruit is perfectly fine to eat but you will probably find yourself feeling hungry if you mainly have a fruit diet best of luck to you trish,0
want to help eliminate the pay gap girls drop your gender studiesenglish lithistory major and take up engineering,0
funny how they make less and also manage to spend more than men really makes you think,0
hi waiting for it from india ,0
im expecting a comment from freelee ,0
yes queen save those animals ,0
 flexitarian  why does this sound like they are flexing that they are vegetarian  flexing vegetarian flexitarian i cannot,0
i just went pescetarian yesterday after finally opening my eyes i know its not veganism but im working towards it thank you so much for your help freelee ,0
as a transgender man i agree and experience some of the things trisha said but also greatly disagreed with other things im not going to say trisha is lying or trying to just get attention right now but im not fully convinced since trans people should transition to identity as their trans identity im on the fence and wether or not i take this seriously all relys on trishas actions from this moment on,0
hella good eyeliner,0
this is what equality looks like they wanna make more money then beat these hoes,0
well good luck to you i tried to be a vegan but i swear its really hard to commit now i try my best to go vegan whenever i can but all the best to you,0
okay is anyone else thinking shane please go get your girl like if your willing to name an eyeshadow after her please tell her why this is as fucked as it is friends support friends but friends should also tell each other when they are being toxic and detrimental to their own community but whatever yeehaw i guess,0
they are not girls you can identify as a baby or a cow or a baby cow but it would not make you one hormone therapy does not make you a girl it does not override the fact you had four times the testosterone developing your muscles and bones since birth not to mention they went through most of puberty as boys this is permanent they are winning not because they are talented but because they are boys racing in a girls race some the comments here are alarming haley  how is it cheating how are you that ignorant what are they teaching kids in school today are they afraid to tell them the truth so they lie and tell them hormone therapy takes away the advantage seriously so we are raising a society of imbeciles for the sake of not offending trans people wtf,1
if the wage gap existed where men make say  an hour and women make  an hour then why not only hire women why pay men the extra  when you can save that by paying only women,0
ppl who say women get paid less because they have kids yes because its their choice to have kids and get pregnant by themselves,0
some interesting stats but seems oversimplified to me can you really dumb it down to how flexible the hours are,0
freelee im am a young teen who wants to vegan but because im too young to get a job and my parents refuse to let me its impossible ive shown them articles documentarys and videos including yours about the truth if animal products and the benefits of going vegan and they still refuse to let me please what can i do,0
why would someone hire men if women can do it for less checkmate buddhists monks,0
this is my favorite video,0
trisha gets canceled by trisha ,0
it can be difficult to be vegan where i live because the fresh produce is expensive and the junk is cheap but it is possible and worth it,0
veganism is controlled starvation and infertility is the intended effect mindless slaves you will become chasing fruit and sex with no regard for higher virtues that build society,0
i miss the gender pay gap because now women get paid more than a man for less overall work,0
if there is one woman in america working a legal job getting paid less than a male coworker with exactly the same hours education contract time in the job etc then she can sue the pants off her employer as well as publicly humiliate them on social media doesnt really sound like a patriarchal conspiracy,0
clap clap clap,0
ok not bad same infos than the others vegan documentary when are we going to talk about real healthy nutrition as most of this food ou talk about is processed food,0
equal treatment does not mean equal results equality does not mean equity,0
are we gonna just ignore the blatant disrespect to nonbinary ppl in this video you can disagree with trisha without shitting on other people in the community,0
vegan fishies rejoice,0
dont go for trish this is her ,0
i literally have a headache trying to figure this chick out transgender no honey you arent transgender although you probably need some help,1
if the difference is largely due to individual choice then i want to know why do women choose jobs that pay less or why does society think women should do these jobs also it is not entirely the choice of a person whether or not they get the job,0
make vegan mac and cheese,0
i would love if you had an only fans sheesh,0
 i mean,0
i love avocado slices on vegan pizza,0
honestly the video was hilarious to me ,0
oh honey you are just so delusional,1
great video glad you made this video so this wage gap some feminists are complaining about is finally debunked,0
the title frustrates me because it may not have been the best received but you cannot and do not have the right to say that she isnt,0
we call this brazil,0
 who else here loves massive attack ,0
youre attracted to gay males and james is attracted to straight males thats great,0
eat good carbs that are filling like rice pasta with veggies potatoes bananas etc this will fill you up so your full and satisfied ,0
never felt so amazing vegan md,0
avocados mushrooms spinach tomatoes tortillas veggie burgers,0
i hate exo suits  i often use them to much ,0
i would title her a non binary pansexual,0
i love christina hoff summers,0
wait i kinda understand this but maybe its bc im high,0
freelee is such a bitchugh,1
even as a trans person i think this is unfair like i would get it if they transitioned before they went through male puberty because then it would be equal but they have gone through male puberty and science is science they have an advantage,0
look up vegan restaurants in your area youll find good junk food  itll make the transition easier,0
ol words of wisdom i love this channel,0
pinterest will literally save your life so many vegan recipes and boards its probably one of the main reasons i was able to transition to a vegan lifestyle so smoothly plus if youre struggling with staying loyal to the diet there are a lot of really inspirational vegan messages also you can get the apps cronometer and is it vegan they helped so much im so happy and proud of you i hope you fall in love with this diet and stay vegan ,0
mommytang is my fav i get a lot of ideas from her,0
this is jumping on the bandwagon for real what an idiot all for attention and heybehold her success,1
she needs some milk,0
da fuk youtube unsubed me from this channel assholes,0
do a vegan mukbang,0
what people missed about the wage gap it doesnt bloody exist,0
i dont wear makeup and do my hair like normally and that doesnt make you more of a boy shes so stupid and just trying to be relevant again,0
ngl she slayed her makeup today u look really good lately girl im happy for you xo,0
there is no gender wage gap  only in as much as women do half the hours men do but want the same pay,0
yeah you cant really blame her the lgbtqaip community really messed up the concept of transexual people also i identify as a gay man because i love britney spears,0
i bet freelee the banana girl will make a video on trish,0
youll get paid as much if you do as good a job,0
somehow i feel ezra klein chief editor at vox must have been on vacation the week this video got the green light to be posted he would have a fit and cry sexism if he saw this then go back to celebrating the slanderers at the splc and telling sam harris that islam is a religion of peace,0
if ppl could get away with paying women less then they would just hire women,0
go to whole foods and stock up on annies foods they make a bunch of vegan options that you can eat,0
transitioning to avoid brushing your hair holy shit,0
u just want male privilege you literally just described yourself as gender fluid,0
i want you to be aware that some people start off pretty rocky when they first go vegan from either not being sure what to eat and how much or from your body cleansing its self once you start a healthy diet your body wants to release all the junk toxic food you have been eating before and thats why people feel tired sick gain weight etc and it gets mistaken that veganism is doing that to your body but really its the food you ate before releasing just stick with and youll feel amazing and get great results this is what happened to me in the beginning but i kept going and adjusting to what worked for me and im soooo glad i did because it was one of the best decisions of my life almost every problem i struggled with mentally and physically wishing all my luck towards you trisha,0
honestly what bothers me is treating the men as the bad guy in this statistic i mean the use the fact a lot of women want to have kids as the big reason for the gap or the fact many women would just stay home with the kids however there is sth that doesnt get adressed mainly  well if a woman stays home who do you think needs to earn more to support that yeah a man i swear it like this statistic tries to frame men as these greedy bastards cheating women out of their money but if the woman stays home with kids that leaves the man responsible to earn money for that woman with kids so this horrible image of a man cheating woman out of her money is in fact earning money for the family why is this never brought up,0
im so sick of yall hating on other people for eating meat people are raised eating meat so yall need to chill the fuck out because i am done and if we dont want to be vegan we dont have to and these hate comment on trisha is a fucking dick ass move and i fucking hate all of yall being assholes because of the way she is so the next time yall hate on others because they are not vegan think about before you became vegan because i know that every fucking single one of you are meat before and dont act like yall having now all im going to say is fucking stop assholes,0
i realize that some of the stuff she said is offensive and shit but like do you realize how hard this shit is half the people on here hating are cis like not all transgender people are the same now im not defending her but please shut up ,0
i guess i am a man then since i dont use makeup at all i am just way to lazy to put some on,0
so mutch stupidity in less than an hour,0
really awesome film year old woman hereim happily vegan for  years nowwish i did it soonernever has it been so easy to find vegan options in heres to veganforlife,0
vegan diet is the only way to extremely healthy along with exercise my bp is normal not high my cholesterol is great my type two diabetes is controlled without insulin or metformin lost about  pounds in a three month period even my sleep apnea has improved greatly many people have asked me do i miss the meat egg and dairy there are so many plant varieties of meat substitutes and they taste amazing great,0
this is not an attack but if you want to be thanked for helping someone out then you have abit of an egoits polite to thank someone i know but its not a must people help because they care and do it out of love not so they can get credit i know everyone is difirent am just saying,0
sad indeed they need help  god bless us all,0
did vox just disprove the gender wage gap vox,0
they want equal pay have a good education have a career plan work longer like the men even tho it will last to midnight or over there problem solve dont like it deal with it,0
oh my gosh trisha im so happy for you hopefully youll stick with it it truly is the best decision ive ever made loved this video ,0
well her hair looks dope,0
why white people always eating fruit right out the bag you not finna rinse that shit,0
trish you are the fucking best ,0
yaay sooo happy for you i was nervous to go vegansay i was vegan too i was scared i wouldnt be able to stick to it so i just quietly started cutting things out but found it so yum and enjoyable that eventually i came out and said well i guess im vegan then so fruit is by farrrrr the healthiest way to eat however dont forget about rice and potatoes do not be afraid of having bread or cereal or whatever you need to at least help you in the transition stagewhatever will make it easy and enjoyable for you finally zero stress about packaged things i still do that and it certainly doesnt mean youre not vegan i would be very surprised if you got anything but support for this video at least from vegans hehe,0
this is a physical sport not an emotional one the body is still physically male so this isnt really fair sports wise i am glad they are living their truth though in the gender they are,1
eat as much as u want u will lose weight in the first  days u will look bloated the first couple days but thats only because your body isnt used to all that much food fried tofu is the best thing for protein or kale love them both,0
you will most likely feel like shit for the first few weeks as your body is going through a detox after the two weeks please continue for another two weeks to finish the detox period and i promise you will feel amazing ps eat enough calories,0
thank you for releasing this video on my birthday ,0
trisha and i and i and i and i me oop,0
nobody really gets rewarded for working exceptionally long hours  but they do extra hours pay more working on holidays pays more and working nights pays more how about we dont ignore the fact that men work longer hours,0
wow it took you years to acknowledge that the pay gap is a myth and that perpetuating lies may hurt your image your arrogance knows no bounds by the way youre not fooling anyone anyone with even half a brain knows youll lie about anything for as long as you can get away with it,0
ahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahhahahaha i knew youd do this ahahahahahaha,0
i own a business and have men and women working for me women have beautiful work ethic much better work ethic than men but when it comes to physical tasks in our place i find men usually can work harder for longer periods of time but not always true but i believe thats why men are paid more though theres a higher demand for male employees i have better success in my business hiring males over female but we do a lot of physical labor i hire women for jobs in my business that i need people to be more trustworthy and meticulous however,0
go to mc donald,0
more people would take you seriously if you would stop cursing and being a bully,0
shes non bianaryprobably ,0
k people went to their safe spaces,0
she has messed up her face big time its a shame she was beautiful before all the facelifts and lip injections but i will state she is making a mockery of transgenderism,1
hey i totally get this im sorry ppl dont understand,0
this video is ridiculous the problem is that women are paid less for doing the same job so when a field employs more women the average income in that field decreases because women are paid less than men the reverse is also true men get paid more for the same job so a fields annual income will average out higher because they hire mostly men,0
she went vegan for  days then made a video of her smacking chicken in her mouth like a cow and crying on her kitchen floor,0
its one thing to be trans but pushing it on the rest of us no,1
thanks for making this so i didnt have to give her my view lol,0
if u subscribe to prager u your an insecure ignorant sheep think for yourself,0
i need to ask a question i have compared my pay to women at the same job and it is the same pay so where is the gap i have looked at men in higher payed jobs and noticed they usually involve risk taking of some form so the gap must probably then exist in these levels of employment my question now is if you see fit to charge a man more for insurance because of risky behavior why dont you see it fit to pay men for these traits,0
she likes pizza too much to be vegan,0
 pounds  trisha theres grade s at my school that are  ur not over wieght at all ,0
did you see trishs post from a day ago shes eating chicken,0
trisha im a gay man drag queen also trisha i dont like theythem its just confusing,0
trisha i wouldnt say im confused me well i am,0
conflicting earnings with wages you even say they take less paying jobs men take more dangerous jobs and put in more hours and of course women have more responsibilities of a baby it starts from the beginning men dont lactate lol they dont get paid less for the same job just like you said the jobs are requiring things they dont want to do like specific schedules you cant have it all,0
i love this women,0
that is  unfair im not sexist cuz i know people will say i am but men are just born with more athleticism and just cuz she changes genders doesnt mean she loses her athleticism,0
the gender wage gap is described as the relationship between men and womens pay it is said that women are getting paid roughly  cents to the dollar that every man makes the wage gap is calculated by taking the average amount full time men and women make and dividing them by each other to get the difference in regards to womens soccer from the article pay disparity in us soccer there seems to be a pretty large pay difference between the players however there is also a benefit difference for instance women get a salary and possible bonuses along with health benefits and maternity leave whereas men do not reap these benefits but i would assume the article did not include mens salary they make more if they play often i chose to watch the video there is no gender wage gap and i do agree with some of the points that she brings up for instance she spoke about choices that men versus women might make that add to the variables of the pay they earn womens often choose jobs that are not considered to be the most high payingpersonally i do agree with some aspects that she brings in the video i chose to go to school to become an elementary school teacher i could have chosen a route with a much higher pay but i enjoy working with children and love the classroom environment being a school teacher i would be able to have summers and holidays off i believe it would be a profession where i could also raise a family without having to pay thousands of dollars for childcare,0
ahh its so typical for these feminatzis to bring up responsibility in the home this is literally a decision two people make together are woman some how forced to be more caring to their children whose forcing them to be more scheduled the husbands its so usless to throw in this fact,0
i really dont think the wage gaps a problem afterall most woman ive seen want the benefits of being a man without any of the huge disadvantages,0
it is unfair,0
good thing i left the psychology major wow,0
so funny about all these rah rah comments  none of you all give a sht that women earn so little youre like who cares if their full time jobs dont earn sht its their choice to teach our kids maybe get shot wipe our grandpas butts help get the homeless drug treatment  shelter stay home a while with a mans children suckers are your values all about the market,0
trish im not vegan but im so happy for u and i hope u get really happy and confident and i love you so much,0
omg i freaking love you and your personality i wanna be your bestie lol i found you a few videos ago and im hooked subd for sure,0
if you keep the animals in mind its not hard to stay vegan ,0
them theyre brave ill say it takes a lot of courage to compete against someone you know youre probably going to beat real brave unbelievable,0
i eat a lot of peanut butter as a vegan,0
her vocal fry is extremely annoying,0
i wasnt buying this either but this video cleared everything up for me,0
it wont last,0
awaiting a response from freelee lol,0
absolutely unfair but who cares about the biological girls that train hard for this but cant outrun biology,1
triiiiiiiiish go girl the vegan community is behind you you can do this  freelee will help you girl so no worries,0
thank you so much for everything you guys create to shed light into the darkness of this world ,0
make sure to eat your carbs and healthy fats but mostly carbs try and eat  calories and get that body moving you can do this,0
yay im so happy i love you and your videos and this makes me happy so much as far as tips its so easy to get vegan food that has spices to make it taste exactly like any meat you might be craving troll whole foods and the natural section of stop  shop because youd be surprised how much food is actually vegan also you can make anything into a vegan recipe experiment with tons of different foods and remember it might take a few tries to find cheese you like and other foods dont eat just raw fruit and veggies because youll feel tired and run down and make sure youre eating a lot fruits and veggies dont have tons of calories freelee was right about eating tons of food with no guilt give veganism time it grows on you youll feel amazing after a while youll have more energy and your body will thank you love you xo ,0
whats wrong with eating an oyster or scallop they dont have a brain ,0
yaaaaaaaaaaass trisha im so happy for you that youre trying out the vegan life i myself went vegan for a eek and never stopped because its just so easy refreshing and rewarding my advice would be literally buy all the veggies their natural delicious taste comes through more the more you eat them i find and get into home cooking but if not there are tonnes of vegan replacements out there way more out there in la than there are here in britain i wish you the best of luck and hope you enjoy and stick with this journey xoxo,0
i support the transgender community all the way but the ncaa was right in making that rule they should have to be on estrogen for at least a year you can hear it in their voices that they havent been on it long enough i dont want them to feel excluded but these cis girls should not suffer,0
when was this video filmed is she vegan now,0
whoa surprisingly great job vox,0
i am currently a vegan but i am still waiting for a documentary that isnt bias,0
this is so obviously a trolling video lmfaoo,0
trisha please eat rice pasta potatoes vegetables and fruits its so fucking amazing,0
if women were paid less why would anyone hire men,0
this is vodka by the way blaire ,0
imagine having a guy compete in girls sports,0
this was incredibly useful and interesting if we truly want to make a change fully understanding what is going on is the best way to do so good job vox,0
steamed white rice with nori sheets and sliced avocado for vegan sushi love you girlam so proud of you flawless inside and out love an italianhispanic girl from mar vista by santa monica,0
trishaaaaaa im so proud of you for giving veganism a chance my boyfriend just went vegan a few days ago and i bought him a bunch of meat and dairy replacers such as daiya shredded cheese and boca vegan burgers and some vegan chocolate and more however these are vegan junk foods if you want to slim down then i recommend lots of fruit and dark leafy greens also pasta potatoes beans nuts and seeds i know you said youre doing this mainly for looks and fitness but dont be afraid to indulge in that vegan junk food every once in a while i love you good luck ,0
pretending pharmacists work at am as a majority is hilarious this video is hilarious and the producer and writer have cancer,1
its pretty ridiculous how hard it is to find this video on yt even if you search the exact title of the video,0
there is no time we must hurry i dream a vegan world,0
i would recommend watching stella rae videos as well as nina and randas videos  they helped me the most going vegan,0
the end result of a generation who are basically indoctrinated into the listen and believe mantra instead of autonomous free thinking but then again we cannot have any questions asked of the powers that be,0
too bad it didnt mention a lot more nuances of the gap and still had the slightly sexist edge to it but whatevs,0
didnt she just make a videopoem about being a women with big boobs and men are sick,0
omg its not because theyre transgender its because regardless of how they identify theyre still stronger than girls because of their biology,0
cancel this bitch bury her i get shes funny and a laugh but you need to stop supporting this she should lose all her subscribers,1
finally someone said the true,0
lmao come on are they serious,0
also good ass chocolate frosting for a good vegan chocolate cake is an avocado the green stuff only half a cup of maple syrup half a cup of coco powder so gooooooddd,0
 of statistical data is made up on the spot,0
clicks and views are genuinely important to her what else does she have,0
shes making a whole joke out of the lgbt community,0
i dont believe it for a minute,0
i love you christina but im not loving that red lipstick girl it doesnt suit your look,0
lol well that didnt work out did it vv i feel bad for trisha she seems to have emotional eating problems,0
trish yes yes yes yes yes,0
never bought merch before but i find myself sitting here awake at am still not having slept yet binge watching your videos  and now i wanna cop some merch,0
those two punks who killed and ate the squirrels are everything thats wrong in the world so idiotic ignorant and threatened by enlightenment,0
 you know that average and median arent the same thing right i mean they might happen to be the same number depending upon the data set in question though they often arent the same number as well but they are still decidedly not the same thing or calculated the same way,0
talking about the gender wage gap is besides the point because even the concept equal pay for equal work built into law violates legal rights that are owed to a person and constitutes a due process violation namely if i due to my personal preferences want to give more of my own money to a man than to a woman that is my personal choice its my money and i have the right to do what i want with it if i prefer working with men more then with women and thus pay a man more than a woman for equal work no one has the right to intervene and tell me how to manage my own money it is my money but the government does it forces me to pay them equally it forces me to give my own money to someone although i entered no legallybinding relationship with that person but is all based on the ideological concept of equality given the fact that lawmakers ideological concept be it equality or whatever cannot trump legal rights that are owed to a person basing the laws on the concept equal pay for equal work is a due process violation,0
rice and fuckin beans also eat your water eat tons of water melon and fruit high in water also healthy fats nuts and avocados  so proud of u trisha tons and tons of healthy carbs carb the fuck up ,0
lol youtube comments so toxic then you go to her insta and all the comments are positive yikkers,0
also jobs that are considered female have a lower salary naturally nurses teachers child care professionals maids all have salaries that are significantly lower than say construction manufacturing and so on these jobs have a lower salary because historically they were female positions and since the female was nvr a main bread winner they could naturally pay them less,0
i just think shes a confused lesbian smh,0
thank you mam for clarification because nobody would be believe if man explain it,0
please everyone go vegan,0
this is unfair i have participated in provincial track and field meets and this is simply unacceptable firstly they started taking testosterone suppressors in th grade which means they had a male muscular and bone growth for  the majority of their lifes secondly the  girl  who came first in the state championship  m dash had a  s run which is easily  to  sec over the average qualifyers for state male this clearly demonstrates that if they were to participate in the male races they would not even come close to qualifying for state and on top of that taking the st and nd place,1
if you notice that the highest paying college majors include different fields of engineering an area that is highly devoid of female talent,0
im not trans i live ur videos thank u for helping people,0
try cherries with tajin seasoning and lime also go veggie parmesan is good as well as cacao powder for smoothies,0
still not sure why i keep getting chicken ads with freelees videos,0
thats cool she is trying it for two weeks,0
fraudlee is a fucking talking skeleton with a blonde wig not because shes vegan but because she cycles up mountains in thailand every fucking day people need to stop thinking that going vegan is some magic potion and for someone whos already heavy like trisha following fraudlees high carb low fat diet is gonna put even more weight on you carbs get digested as sugar which is stored as fat you gotta burn that all off if you expect to lose weight,1
nobody trisha i identify as a gay man oh shit ,0
favorite chocolate milk shake that you can eat everyday  frozen bananas  or  scoops of raw vegan vanilla protein powder  i use  scoop you can find this powder at whole foods  tablespoons of organic cocoa powder  tablespoons of powdered peanut powder  cup of unsweetened almond milk  dates pitted sooooooooo goood,0
there were some lightly misleadingly used statistics in here but i like the overall message so gave it a like,0
bitch disabled her comments,1
stupid guy throwing his foodhe is so ignorant,0
i really hope you can do it this time please remember its a lifestyle even if just for  weeks it includes no leather no animal products at all regardless of if its edible or not when you are vegan you need carbs you need to eat plentifully eating small amounts puts your body into fat storing mode never be hungry but eat the right things embrace the carbs avoid the fat and sodium if possible vegan isnt a diet its a lifestyle and you wont loose weight in  weeks if done properly first your body goes through detox from all the animal products then you may put on some weight as your body ajusts to eating well in time you will loose weight you loose weight slowly but it stays off unlike a fat diet in  weeks though your skin will glow and you will feel so good you wont care too much about weight anymore well done im proud of you soak up advice and welcome to a healthier happier you ,0
freelee is gonna freak out,0
good luck girl i am trying the same lifestyle myself i watched one of free lees videos and havent been able to eat chicken since either contact freelee and joey and daniel im sure they would be helpful with ideas tips and supportive,0
edit i dont believe a wage gap exists i am a statistician this video undermines itself by stating there are so many variables that drive wages that no single study can cover all of them well a single one or the variable hasnt been found to title there is no gender wage gap then say  or   wage gap exists then there you go youve agreed it had been found and it exists a woman can get cervical cancer because only a woman has a cervix since wage is nonbiological we need to find the social determinant of the  also why not post all sources in the description i was super excited for this video now its easily dismissed as propaganda anyway i have to go buy a nintendo switch with my  larger mathematics major salary,0
for thous who say there is no wage gap watch the video before making a comment please,0
the  dislikes are all women xd no offense to anyone its just a joke,0
if you take all of the money earned by women and compare it to all of the money earned by men you will arrive at the conclusion that women earn  of the money that men earn once you factor in for educational choices women tend to choose socially oriented fields while men still overwhelmingly make up those who choose stem fields career investment women tend to time more time away from their career to raise families and time spent working men tend to work more overtime than women do that gap narrows to nil want to make a ton of money choose a stem degree work  hours a week for  years and never get pregnant,0
just subscribed to u again ,0
dont understand why people find this so offensive i just thought the whole thing was stupid ,0
so its ok if theres a gender wage gapif the industry is dominated by one gender unless youre a nurse,0
im sorry but its not correct women dont work as long and dont go to higher paying jobs,0
no ur certainly wrong,0
ok but wtf,0
this is so messed up and wrong i believe being lgbtq is great unless your messing with children but in sports this needs to stop,0
competitors parents claim they have an unfair advantage nope abc news biology dictates that they indeed have an unfair advantage,0
its definitely not fair you have two people who are built like males competing against females who are built like females im sorry but they shouldnt feel any pride in those wins compete against boys and then you can feel pride and are they going to get scholarships based off these fake wins its not right for the female competitors and they should feel compassion for their female competitors,1
stopped watching because the sound bite of trevor noah now i know what kind of journalism this is,0
money isnt everything id rrather have a nice life than being filthy rich,0
okay she really just said i identify as a drag queen man as someone who has been out as non binary for  years now this disgusts me and really offends me i want to say that first of all dysphoria of some sort is needed to be trans it doesnt have to be with your body like for me i found it harder to deal with my name and pronouns and people using the wrong ones etc as well as disliking my body but not as much anyway this video is bullshit and i can already see her saying the trans community is unaccepting in the future but actually theyre some of the nicest people ive met and supported me through a rough time in my life,1
makes me feel that the left is just trying to use any excuse to pick a fight with society,0
welp she has a more manly face than me and smashes food like a dude,0
cant wait when she comes out as muslim,0
feminists are always whining about something they claim they are fighting for equalities when in fact theyre fighting for superiority over man how can the so called wage gap be zero  and  is so small its negligible considering men work as spies or other dangerous jobs,0
scientists have flexible hours are you insane most scientists work their asses off over hours they barely have time to do anything else,0
youre showing old data though why dont you redo this video with  data maybe then you might actually convince me and many others,0
ugly faces cant believe you strait up lied to your audience like that,0
but trish make sure youre eating enough otherwise you wont stay vegan for very long anything less then  calories per day is considered starvation according to the world healthy organization so eat a lot so you will be satisfied,0
 is that it doesnt exist its an earnings gap,0
misleading regarding the pharmacist job did the genderration change did the overall wage go down for the job,0
omg the first thing that popped in my head was is she on crack the dry mouth over accentuating definitely something else going on,1
you took it a lil far with this one trish ,0
best ad bc its actually abt ppl who are transgender,0
watch trishas last video shes stuffing her face with chicken fingers and fried dead animals,0
yasss mama fishii you should try twenty one days instead its highly recommended,0
freelee maybe you could also give her the advice of her going crueltyfree and vegan with her makeup  theres probably a small chance of it but lets try why not ,0
has freelee addressed what a scum bag she is,1
 unexplained wage gap i have an explanation  to  percent of us companies are stuck in the dark ages just a thought,0
trust me when i tell you i worked with a bunch of women and they have no problem giving me more work in paying me less and when the new girl came into work she did the same job as me and got paid  a year more women are absolutely vicious,0
people say veganism is an extreme lifestyle id say the intake of  different drugs a day to solve the symptomes of your dietcausedsicknesses is extreme seventhday adventist cf adventist health study proclaim a plant based lifestyle since about  years who is listening but veganism is not the only point in health a newstart would change your life cf weimar institute n utrition plant based e xercise regular physical w ater drink  litres pure per day s unlight nature t rust in god this is the triune god the creator and sustainer of life a ir fresh r est during sleep and on the rest day god commanded which is the sabbath t emperance no drugs no alcohol no tobacco and everything else in the right amount,0
shes lost it,1
i am so grateful to the good lord that i am no longer in highschool and have to deal with this shit it obvious that these so call girls are young men they take hormone pills which is illegal and are competing against girl young women who are not allowed to take any drug inducers or reducers so its unfair from the start they need to make their own little transgender team where they can be who and what the fuck they want to beone can be casper and the other a chipmunkif that is what they definitely themselves asbut stop shoving down our throats shit their sickness and trying to rationalize itwhat the fuck,1
according to trisha im trans,0
so to summarize women make choices to get paid less while men make choices that pay them more so women should go make better choices what do you think would happen if you take the same top  professions and compare avg salary between men and women instead of generalizing that women make choices that pay less and could you not use sexist variables like men are more willing to work more than women that is sexist and a generalization,0
this video is intentionally being intellectually dishonest,0
this is false the biggest thing that shows that is the fact that noone ever says the same numbers,0
i started being vegan in feb  almost my first year i will never regret it,0
trisha had chicken and waffles on snapchat today,0
wheres freelee at,0
oh and girl i go to starbucks almost every other day and i can still get all frappuccinos lattes etc just get soy milk and it literally tastes better than regular milk and im not just saying that because im a vegan my friend who hates any vegan food tried it and said it tasted better than usual and asked me what was different,0
around middle school i started growing boobs and getting attention from older men welcome to the club you arent special,0
fuckin milli vanilli,1
these guys are packed with testosterone,1
wait it compares the median wage not the mean thats moronic the median is just the middle number value out of a large sample size it is not useful in comparing statistically the wages of men and women as it either underselling or overselling the differences because of it the median doesnt take any factors into account of the study sample and is just lazy to use,0
trish you must try gardein products they make the best mock meat out there ,0
you can still get all of your starbucks favorites they always have soy milk and many carry both soy and coconut milk too so whenever you order a frapp or whatever just specify youd like it soymade with coconut milk etc ,0
this video deserves more like,0
it takes a little while before you start seeing visible results so be patient trish,0
if women would stop breeding they would be able to climb the income gap it is children that put you in poverty,0
but thats a dead animals pelt to your right huh,0
 k is not  less than k,0
no shhhh stop using logic,0
im confused becuase usually with transgenders if they wanna be the opposite gender they start off like that at an early age for example if you let a man your going to be very feminine and girly and if your a girl you will be very masculine and manly,0
thomas sowell debunked this a long time ago lol,0
im so proud of you trisha this is such a huge step omg you go gurl fruits digest fast so maybe you can try some starches as well oatmeal is great for breakfasts smoothies too  potatoes are so good for dinner too just eat when you feel hungry i cant wait to see how you do in  weeks ,0
feminists will hate this truth bomb lol,0
eat carbs potatoes pasta rice etc follow mommytang she has amazing recipes and eat when u hungry and stop when ur full ,0
freelee i have been watching you for  year ive been though depression binge eating disorder anorexia i never thought i would ever go vegan im so fed up with stupid diets and being unhappy you are a role model for me and from watching you for so long i made a final decision and become vegan i wanted to thank you for keep doing videos please keep making videos ,0
pinterest is amazing for recipes  been vegan for years and its the best thing ive ever done bite size vegan is an amazing channel to look at,0
you are actually hurting my brain,0
americans always wants to find a stupid reason without evidence and more stupid people will support this reason will make more problem that problem now will continued on by stupid people so over all stupid men and women are the problem,0
wage gaps if they are real make sense the government expects married women to have a male with a job alongside them to add up to the total salary needed for the family and even if the male doesnt have a job it is a proven statistic men do better than women this means performance determines how much you earn for work not your gender,1
i really hope this is true if it is you really should stop buying leather makeup and any products tested on animals i love you,0
waiting for freelee to make a video on this,0
so women and men that work the same positions get paid the same oh okay so there isnt a gender gap its an earnings gap,0
hi freelee i have a question about a problem that i have and i was hoping you could either make a video about this or just give a thorough response im only  and i live in a household where everybody eats animal based products ive been wanting to become vegan for a while now but i know that my family will not change their diet along with me i dont have a job since i am currently focusing on school extra curriculars and volunteer work specifically with animals and im sure im not the only one in this situation what do you suggest i do thank you for inspiring me to want to change my diet,0
isnt it illegal to pay women less than men ,0
my teacher tries to shove this myth down the throat of my classmates and i honestly it gets my blood boiling,0
califia  drink instead of frappucino,0
this was recorded a month ago she isnt vegan anymore,0
good for you trish stick around  calories a day and walk youll lose weight i cant agree with eat as many calories a day as you want when i first went vegan i gained weightcalories in calories out,0
we dont claim her end of story,0
crush the patriarchy like youre crushing that puss,0
yes trish cant wait to see freelees reaction video to this,0
veganism is a disease of the mind a delusion and mental illness of the st century,1
having a citizens assembly ca as a demand from a mass street movement is demanding their own demise,0
why do you say we need to close the wage gap when you acknowledge they earn less because of life choices children ie there is no earnings gap also looking at the earnings of mba grads from a single ivy league school is ridiculous,0
if the wage gap were real business owners would hire a lot more women so they could cut their costs by paying them less this would increase the demand for cheap female workers and drive wages down for men who are trying to compete,0
i think you might be genderfluid ,0
you should see the hh podcast with her,0
yaaaayyy so proud of you trish,0
but still women ceos get lesser salary than male ceos lol,0
so genderfluid also this makes me so angry that this seems like clickbait and ads t has done stuff like this before and im all about making mistakes on how you feel it happens and everyone has the right to discover and grow but i dont believe t has grown maturity wise i dont know ts life outside of screen but whats on screen shows a lack of respect maturity growth and shows offensive stupidity and ignorance on who t claims to be or to like or to trust or even to hate misinformation or a lack of information cause t to jump to conclusions fast i respect that you feel this way but i beg you please please please dont capitalize on this and trans people lgbt people and most importantly capitalizing on your own gender identity discovery and journey by putting ad or using it to cover up past issues like vlog squad by making it clickbait making it money making it the same mistakes youve made in the past i beg you to grow i beg you to explare i beg you to not put ads on videos about your transitions physical and mentally i beg you educate yourself and not invalidate anyone i beg you to respect people who have died to be who they identify as fighting for your right to explore who you are i may not like you as a person but i support you exploring who you are and i only want you to please grow and mature,0
if the wage gap is real then why arent majority of the worlds companies hire women only women are cheap right therefore companies would be hiring only them checkmatefeminazis,0
deep inside we all know this,0
wearing makeup and growing your hair doesnt make you a girl,0
pleasepleaseplease go and check out this girls channel shes vegan and not to mention shes so amazing and gorgeousive been subscribed to her for a while and the food she makes is so yummytrish i hope you check her outshes amazeing ,0
there is so much i want to say but there simply arent words strong enough,0
the wage gap between an attack helicopter and the samsung galaxy note  battery that exploded  months ago is gigantic its so sexist,0
finally actual facts from vox and not just sexist racist and homophobe,0
and how long will this last ,0
so proud of u trish the peta website is ur best friend for amazing recipes theres tons for recipes u wouldnt even think could be made vegan u will find its not nearly as limiting as it seems,0
woman that want to be great business women and raise great kids realize they can only do one or the other so they work less hours simple as that oh and men choose more dangerous but higher paying jobs like construction plumbing risk of infection or ruining someones property etc,0
i hate blaire she makes me question my sexuality stop being so cute hun its confusing,0
what the actual fuck is wrong with you you have crossed into waters that you need to back track real quick out of this whole video is a fucking mess your explaining is a mess trans people are not confused but by god you are you put on a wig for a week and like gay men so now your suddenly saying your trans what the fuck trisha you explained being gender fluid you clearly have some more thinking to do fuck am i and most likely the rest of the community highly offended by this complete and utter bullshit,1
here before it gets deleted,0
well the only problem is many peoply replace the meat with stuff made of soy all in all good except millions of squaremiles of rainforest gets incinerated to plant soy there and when the soil is deploited they have to incinerate a new piece of forest to get new land for their agriculture and the dead soil they leave behind doesnt get enough time to recover and becomes a degradated forest we cant continue this th rainforest is the biggest carbondioxide storage of our planet and destroying it sets all this carbondioxide free to damage our climate even more if we want to save the planet soy isnt a choice even though of course most of the soy isnt even consumed by the human we still have to care about where the stuff we consume comes from,0
ur the best,0
give me a brake you will never be a viggan you love meat,0
sounds like a straight women with a fetish for gay men to me ,0
its not the wage gap its the ambitions gap,0
so rn based on the like to dislike ratio there are k people pro equality and k feminists neat,0
a female with no job earns  less than a male working as fighter pilot  putting his life at risk for the previous females safety he probably earns more because of sexism,0
check out high carb hannah,0
so people have a problem with these two yet bash folks when they dont want to be involved or around transgay people we spend to much time worrying about the wrong shit we pick and choose the things we wish to complain about much respect to the parents for accepting the kids,0
one thousand social justice warriors dislike this,0
i bet jennifer lawrence does not know these facts lol,0
el coo de la madre,1
if you decided to go vegan for life you cant wear leather stuff bcs its animal product,0
im sorry but ive never understood the appeal of trisha shes a total bore  troll and her videos kill my brain cells,0
if you plan on eating mostly veggies itll be difficult for you to gain weight since you actually have to eat more often since they have less calories than meat and cheese really glad youre going vegan i hope you stay strong and decide to stay vegan for life because not only does it help you and the animals it also helps the planet ,0
women tend to go for a more flexible hours sitting in a chair desk job also women need maternal leave and are the ones who need to ask for sick days in order to take care of a sick child i believe its as simple as that,0
i been vegan for a month and i already know that its the best decision ive ever made at first i thought it would be hard but when you have a real purpose nothing will dare try to stop you i love you all,0
so much amazing content in this movie another great one  will be even better,0
well no more trane ,0
the gender wage gap has been debunked so many times its sad that people have to keep coming out and saying this over and over again while the landwhale feminaizis just plug their ears and yell patriarchy,1
i discovered a good chanel,0
aight i dont agree with trish on this at all and this is because of my question yall are tryna cancel trisha saying shes ftm but acts feminine but yall are fine w people that are ftm who wear makeup nail varnish and wear dresses being ftm and acting feminine will make you dysphoric that is a true sign a person is transgender but yall get upset with people who think someone transgender is their biological sex when they act like their biological sex yes stereotypes are shitty but you have to follow by the stereotypical type of that gender to pass i have spoken to many transgender people and they agree you cant come for trish when you literally praise people for doing the same thing shes doing you praise people that act like the gender they were born and dress like that stereotype of the gender yet you get upset at someone whos doing literally that people may agree of disagree with me but keep this in mind,0
this will last for like  minutes and wait for the kitchen floor vlog,0
freelee where you at,0
no baby noooooo,0
yes you can eat however much u want but try to stay away from eating a lot of fating stuff like pasta etc etc love u gurl ,0
wait so they said taking into account choice the gap is only  cents so does mean there still is a gap then just smaller,0
theres still plenty of foods that you probably eat daily that you wont have to give up and any time youd normally eat meat just replace it with a meat replacement like quorn  lots of crisps are still okay to eat and lots of biscuits are vegan too oreos are vegan theres also a ton of yummy dairy freevegan snacks in shops now in my local store theres a whole dairy free section vegan brownies are amazing especially after being warmed up in the microwave health stores normally have loads of vegan options too also subscribe to nature box or graze box you have the option to only let them send you vegan snacks and their stuff is delicious maybe you can get them to sponsor you too haha good luck trish it seems daunting at first but its really not as difficult as youd expect it to be if you can find the right foods it really doesnt have to be just veggies  rice,0
isnt this the same as straight men that fetishize lesbians,0
thank you for spewing the facts and truth and not myths,0
 weeks is a good start,0
that video clip of that calf getting taken away from her mom made me just break down and cry,0
its plant based not vegan youre still going to have make up and stuff that tests on animals and youre still going to have leather dont proclaim this diet if youre not ready to have the politics that go with it,0
as a new vegan but long time observer of history climate change and veganism being paired together is a dangerous idealism elites have long wanted to establish a technocratic control grid an internet of all things in order to achieve this they have ridden the coattails of the veganism movement to help push it down the pipes going plant based as a protest and shift on mass ag is great but media is shoving climate change a whole other beast down our collective throats tread carefully through this inspired film peace,0
i know making meals can be hard as a vegan but look up some good recipes cuz thats really important,0
trisha paytas the trans queen lol maybe shes parodying how the lgbtqwert community has been behaving lately everyone wants to be classified adjacent to trans while identifying as queer non binary,1
you made this video forever ago dude i remember you wearing this look on snapchat and when you tried the burger king shit you said you had already failed at being vegan lol why you always lyinnnnn,0
look at all of the dislikes it is pathetic if you dont like facts you have no place here and no place in any discussion or debate,0
im vegan and greta stills creeps me out,0
ok so there are plenty of people who have transitioned ftm and have been attracted to men but her explanation on on why she feels the way she does is complete bs and doesnt make sense,0
i was waiting for you to say something hahahaha i loveyou,0
totally unfair this shoyld not even be a discussion,1
the best overview of all the different stories of the year there is just so much in less than  minutes the positive and the negative vegan   the filmthumbs up,0
isnt that an income gap and not a wage gap then,0
literally this video is all over the placesis what,0
sub to me if theres only  genders,0
almond milk or coconut milk and water is delicious,0
men are more likely to have a dependent spouse men are far harder hit by divorce than women women get far more government assistance than men men are more likely to be homeless than women as both the government and relatives are far more likely to help women in poverty tell me again about womens problems,0
 background music  hang massive  once again   ,0
i think people are giving all feminist a bad rep i see a lot of people here who are saying things like all the feminist disliked this video haha and thats just putting all feminists in one group and saying theyre all the same but i i think i count as a feminist and i see this video and im just happy there isnt actually a wage gape they are the feminist extremes that ignore facts and begin to just be sexist towards men but obviously not everyone is like that,0
noone asked about what pronouns are confusing to you please stop,0
trish talk with joey he and daniel most likely do know of great vegan brands for you to try,0
the lord shall bless you,0
hi freelee ive been thinking on going vegan for such a long time now id say probably  months but ive never gotten around to this because my parents dont support this opinion and all they cook is animal based products im  so obviously i cant move out lol i was wondering if you had any tips for going vegan even when everyone around you eats meat i naturally have never been obsessed over meat tbh like i never found the tastiness about it so that is not really what my problem is my problem is that my parents will not buy the large amounts of fruit that i need for the raw till  diet that i really want to get to is there a better way to still be a high carb vegan without doing the raw till  diet thank you for influencing me and making me realize that animal based products are disgusting ,0
this is a surprising look i hadnt thought about how they determine the numbers before for some reason,0
most women who works in business sector i know actually doesnt have problem with work hours most women just prefer not to go into the higher executive offices because it is very stressful,0
the view count is encouraging whenever i say without disclaimer feminists are liars people still look at me like thats an unfair blanket statement hopefully this video will encourage people to look further into the methodology of ascertaining the socalled information that feminists try to disseminate to the public to call it misleading is too mild  like saying that steamed rotting dog shit served with maggots just isnt your cup of tea,0
when properly observed veganism has been hijacked and subverted into a political and economic instrument those that profit from shorting investment markets have an unhealthy interest in nurturing social justice activism this activism is targeted on business and industry to negatively affect market prices simultaneously markets that cater for this cult are encouraged to grow in value welcome to activist hedge funds,0
she has the same colored nails in videos from  weeks age including the video of her trying mcdonalds breakfast,0
 people are feminists,0
i run track an being honest i wouldnt care let them run to many bitter people in the world,0
do i think im transgender yes  do i identify with the gender i was born with yes  me did she just the whole trans community aight imma head out,1
im attracted to gay guys dates jason,0
okay bitch stop how can you be trans if you identify as the gender u were bron with,1
you just destroyed every wage gap feminist sjw guy,0
this is the truth when are feminists going to get common sense one other thing why does the left talk about the gender wage gap so much and then pretend there is no difference between genders when it comes to the lgbt agenda hypocrisy,0
so your justification for this makes me trans yeah  no no just no you can be a tom boy get on better with men especially gay men you can support the lgbtq community i have always been a supporteradvocate for lgbtq but doesnt make me trans i dont always wear make up or glam this doesnt make me trans people are really struggling for acceptance and with their own identity because they identify as trans  seriously people who are trans are struggling and fighting to be treated equally in the workplace and not be discriminated against in their place of work as we speak please stop jumping to conclusions you have not researched properly becuase of you have more masculine energy,0
i had to get into a discussion about this with peers and let me tell you when i said that its a myth that got pissed their line i did the research and that its  pages long and all i asked was what businesses make a wage gap and i almost got hit after class it was hilarious,0
as much as i think her a trolling is kinda funny some of the shit she says can have very negative effects,0
equal pay act of ,0
am i the only one who believes that trisha deleted both videos,0
here is my thoughts on the matter like it matters wich it proberly dont the left have been far to fast on this one they ignored various of things men are faster stronger so we can defo argue its cheating but the root of the real issue is no women stopped it no one took a rational discussion on this those who tried failed so it derailed to be something perverse and stupid mostly stupid did a few doctors say well the this is wrong proberly did a few say its right sure was the cummonity agreeing on this yeah defo their own that is what about the other part fact of the matter its now they talk out and not when it could be stopped and tested in a prober manner this is just stupid and bad for eavryone involved and i do not get why no testing was done and such was done but the other side is equal at fault here they didnt speak up thats my opnion hoped you enjoyed,0
what didnt she say publicly she doesnt get drag queens girl get of the internet,1
this is amazing,0
this was filmed a month ago trish has not had pink nails since filming her music video for daddy issues shes gone through red and baby blue and just got them done today bullshit,0
the thing is it doesnt exist woooaaahhh,0
work harder from my job experiences through life most but not all females work alot less and take more breaks and complain about the their pay not being as goods as the boys my solution to it work harder,1
you cant eat unlimited calories but fruits vegetables beans and legumes are very low in calories so you can eat more than you wouldve on an omni diet try different bean dishes like chickpea curry with veggies black bean burritos fried rice with soy beans or tofu pasta with lentils pasta is pretty high in cals be careful and maybe like a lentil stew good luck anyway,0
cant believe im seeing this  as piers morgan says the world has gone nuts they clearly should not be competing against girls,1
there is a factor you missed the reduction of womens salary after the maternity leave but i dont blame you at all since the united states is one of the very few countries where women dont need to receive by law a period without working when they have a son i thought i had to explain it to you,0
will you adopt me please,0
i support trish but im so confused apologies but the only thing i really got was trish not wanting to be a woman because of society but i hope shes happy,0
trishas channel is what happens when you give the coked out alcoholic woman mumbling to herself outside your local bar a youtube career,1
why not vegetarianism,0
good luck haha i dont want to doubt her but i do its so hard not to doubt this,0
so sheeeees gender fluid,0
its not sexism its common sense quote of the year,0
list of carnivores wolves surrounding a bison wolves are members of the carnivora and their diet consists largely of mammals felines ranging from domestic cats to lions tigers and other large predators some canines such the gray wolf but not the red wolf or coyote domestic dogs are broadly considered carnivorous but the classification is often debated hyenas some mustelids including ferrets polar bears pinnipeds  seals sea lions walruses etc birds of prey including hawks eagles falcons and owls scavenger birds like vultures several species of waterfowl including gulls penguins pelicans storks and herons anurans frogs and toads snakes some lizards such as the gila monster crocodilians sharks and many other species of fish toothed whales octopuses and squid spiders scorpions and many other arachnids mantids giant water bugs and many other insects cnidarians carnivorous marsupials,0
unpopular opinion ive been vegan for a measly  years my problem with the community is the campaign that veganism is cheap demand and supply has risen yet the cost goes up with it im sorry to say but i dont believe the whole population is going to go vegan as long as a big mac is about a dollar while an apple is lb can we start urging the vegan companies we support to start becoming more financially accessible,0
counselling and psychology welp looks like ill have to find a new career then  its what ive stuck to for years now but since its one of the least paying jobs ill probably have to do something i wont enjoy to be able to afford things i wish my high school told me sooner because now i have to start all over again,0
dried pasta potatoes chips nuts hummus most breads fake meats rice veg beans olive oil not butter,0
while the problem is actually different than the one advertised it is a problem nonetheless encouraging women to choose the higher paying careers needs to take place as does increasing the wage for the lowest paying careers,0
the reasons there was that those two already had their hrt the estrogen level was high compared to testosterone which make them joined the girl competetion,0
trisha  you are mentally ill this is nothing to be ashamed of rather the opposite often times but for your sake i think you should talk to someone,1
wow that is amazing news you are amazing for inspiring trisha to give veganism a chance im rooting for trisha ,0
men are also more competitive and ask for more promotions and raises men work more hours than women overall,0
once you do the  weeks youll never wanna go back to a normal diet youll feel so amazing you watch trish hope you can soon become a full vegan love you trish,0
the term she was looking for is bigender she just didnt know what terminology to use,0
sea ice is melting glaciers are disappearing lakes are drying up animals are going extinct and brazil is burning the amazon for the sake of profit we need a paradigm shift and we needed it yesterday theres no other planet and theres not much time left be the change be on the right side of historystop funding animal agriculture  go vegan,0
i always look forward these documentaries it has been a good year and  looks even better for all of us,0
you do you ladyyou do you,0
i hope thrisha is sarcastic and joking,0
the intro had me dead lmao,0
ladies and gents unless someone pointed this out already search there is no gender wage gap on youtube and even put it in quotation marks if you want you will not find this video anywhere close on your search results maybe youll find it if you go  results down i dunno,0
this is a weird conclusion to come to just because trisha doesnt like theythem pronouns personally,0
so i take from this that the wage gap is a choice,0
eat more vegetables cuz fruits have a lot of sugar,0
we looooooveee you eat fruits and then sweet potatoes and rice and beans,0
the k dislikes is feminist idiots,0
adding quinoa to salads or having it with small fruits add texture and its really good,0
i highly suggest going vegan for at least a month because for the first couple weeks your body goes through a detox because its not used to the amount of fiber and if you ever feel like giving in to the standard american diet just remind yourself what made you go vegan i recommend to just keep looking into the horrors of animal agriculture and how it affects not only the animals but our planet because that is such a big issue and if you keep that in mind the benefits or the mind and body just come along with it,0
im so proud of you,0
also theres a law about being underpaid and shit everyone must be paid equal no matter who they are or their backgorund if there was an actual wage gap women would be in most jobs men would have a harder time finding jobs cause they are expensive,0
being a carnivore or vegan there is nothing we can do global warming is already here shutting down the meat industry isnt gonna help as long as we cut trees build more factories and used plastic nothings gonna change remember the dairy and agricultural industry cutting down thousand of trees every day,0
how long ago was this video recorded because if she has been emailing her recently she would know she didnt stay vegan this video should have been about how to keep trisha vegan,0
i dont wanna be offensive but its like she thinks being trans is a fucking trend,0
i for one am completely in favor lets see so called feminists stand up for women for once,0
love it go vegan,0
this is a bad idea,0
oh lord you are so ugly,1
prageru is complete garbage,0
i cant wait for freelees response video shes gonna be so happy lol,0
fuck ya trish way to go girl,0
trisha needs serious help its not even trolling anymore its clinical delusion and she needs mental help shes a mess,1
is calling yourself a trans is now a new trend some part of a shitty challenge,1
hahaha yeah ok lets see how long this lasts,0
computer sciences is more like  male,0
shes trolling ,0
you can always get that frappuccino vegan by replacing regular dairy milk with soy milk or coconut milk its just as yummy,0
maybe the jobs this woman has been paid for has been equal but i have had jobs that i was paid less for than the male coworkers i got paid as much as hr than men i worked with even though they came to the job a year after me,0
shanecome get your friend,0
so because you have disgusting skin it makes you a man lol you fucking joke,1
i honestly hope shes being serious bc otherwise this can be rly problematic,0
stop saying fing its not cool,0
this is so problematic,0
logic is to liberals as garlic is to vampires its so easy to figure out where people get their ridiculous numbers from but it takes a video that they still wont accept to break it down i want to see the pay scale chart in black in white that says a woman will make less at the same job same company same location for the same position did you know that a woman who is an illegal immigrant makes less than the average white maleim done cradling liberals heads trying to explain this shit im done talking they cant be saved,0
a mother has to mother or its just another scumbag on this earth men also make up  of workplace fatalities thats a huge clue,1
the wage gap ended like  years ago if you see women making less it has nothing with gender or maybe its just the job,0
listen i dont get paid for taking care of my cat so why should you get paid for taking care of your kid you dont have to have a kid you knowunless rape so the only people to blame are yourselves if thats your excuse dont get me wrong this goes to everyone stay at home dads are increasing over the years,0
butt hurt meninists attacking everyone theyre even more annoying than the extreme feminists,0
wow this film makes me so happy been a vegan since october  and i just wish i had done it sooner it literally saved lives ourselves and our home,0
luv you blaire ,0
love love love love love ,0
freelee lost the card but trish anyway does not matter and could be true crazy things happen during a heated meeting lolyou better give her other things than fruits or she will not make it freelee she van eat peanut butter dont spoil her start ok ,0
but muh feelings,0
if women were paid less wouldnt they just only employ women to save money,0
look up raw vegan meals cause there is a lot of fruit meals on there,0
how is k  less than k ,0
you cannot eat as much as you want i am vegan myself but freelees brand of veganism is predatory you are basically planning to eat straight up carbs and thats almost pure sugar you will retain water make you a salad girl eat some veggies bake tofu eat black beans veggies need to be the basis of your diet fruit is great but it cant be the basis of your diet do not be afraid of packaged veggies or fruits it doesnt matter if its precut eat your veggies eat some fruit eat some grains and get your protein in its not a magic bullet you still have to work toward a balanced and healthy lifestyle good luck,0
omg you need to react to buzzfeed can u survive a day as a vegan it is terrible,0
vegetarian for over eight months now and incorporating the plant based lifestyle more and more if i can do it you can do it too ,0
yes trishy youre gonna feel and look so good boo and dont be afraid of vegan junk food sometimes cause its still better than animal products  keep slaying girl,0
watch mommy tang on yt,0
lmao the amount of people being misinformed by this video is amazing why do you think men are available oncall to their job more than women because its not their job to go feed the kids help them do their homework and tuck them into bed those are called agentic traits women are expected to have communal traits there are so many theories that debunk this video its actually ironic an old lady who is like  years old is voicing this video its as antiquated as all the dinosaurs who comment supporting it,0
but women are in college at higher rates than men,0
 years vegan we looooove yougo vegan ,0
there actually is its not as wide as some claim but recent research shows its about  cents for men and women in the exact same occupation with the same productivity etc,0
this is amazing trish ive been vegetarian for a year and vegan for several months now and feel amazing i hope you will too nothing but love to you in this endeavor love your channel   ps i can confirm the other comments that soy or coconut milk at starbucks is bombbb,0
the only gap is because women choose different jobs than men men and women are not the same yes they deserve equal opportunity and totally have that in this country but men and women have many distinct differences that we dont need to try and eliminate let women be women and men be men,0
not to force a label on you but it sounds more like you are identifying with gender nonbianry or gender fluidneutral you can feel femminie one day and want short boyish hair the next day and thats fine trans isnt quite the definition i would use personally maybe just gender nonconforming you can identify as those and not use theythem use any pronouns you prefer have people call you heher if you like but trans is a different thing entirely from what you are describing here also saying you are basically a drag queen does not make you trans some drag queenskings are trans some are not some are straight some are gay some are other things drag queen does not always equal trans,0
i feel confused all this is is confusion,0
people have become so open minded that their brains have spilt out,0
the wage gap has been proven false multiple times,0
give woman right they said itd be fun they said,1
the wage gap is created by the manipulation of statistics earnings by gender thus men will always show earning more because bill gates the worlds st trillionaire and sam walton jr owner of walmart are men proponentspropogandanists of the wage gap imply that women working the same jobs and same hours make less money  which would be a violation of state and federal labor laws no company pays women less based on gender women get paid less for working less hours while men get paid more for working overtime vox intentionally omitted the fact that men work most of the overtime to compensate for their wives who opt to stay home to be with their children,0
im so proud of you,0
my only question is what the fuck is wrong with her lips ,0
proud of you d,0
why do you even care about the earnings gap what problem do you have with women making conscious choices to work part time raise kids take more sickvacation days etc dividing people into groups instead of treating everyone like an individual is what keeps us separated,0
i reallyyyyyy want to go vegan but my parents wont let me cuz they think i am still growing and i may stunt my growth due to not consuming enough protein also my parents eat a lot of meat and they say that they dont want to make special meals for me helppppp,0
vegans please become activists ,0
just another cash for clicks hoe who can identify as whatever she wants but it wont change the fact she is hideous to look at,1
trisha go to whole foods they have so many vegan things they have icecream cookies pizza its all vegan you dont have to be raw btw also exercise to look like freelee is important she bike rides but i know you dance so that works,0
heres a little more detail they say its all about the hormones but testosterone levels  when implemented post puberty still wont address other physiological differences women have wider pelvis their log and stride length is disproportionate to their midline than males malefemale ratio of muscle fiber types i iix iia which determine contractile speed strength and endurance also take account and many other factors so yes unfair advantage,0
knew this video was coming lol,0
she came out as a chicken nugget before lol i dont believe a word she says,0
ive been vegan for  years now still a baby vegan i guess haha you can do it trish,0
 wild squirrel factory farming is getting worse and worse we need to take action now go vegan especially dont ever support grey squirrel consuming we wouldnt want the red squirrel to get back speaking of species extinction damn these people know how to twist things its hard to believe unfortunately many do i used to too veganism is not the answer,0
honestly im so worn out from all her emotional outbursts and fluctuations that im just like  oh okay were doing this now i mean i genuinely feel that trisha needs to seek professional help for her alleged bpd because it just keeps getting more and more outlandish this is just a lot for me because wow ya know,0
my god this made me go cook a cheese burger,0
if you eat high carb low fat you can eat a lot without gaining weight but you cannot eat endless caloroes either if your body needs  calories a day and your eat  calories of fruit and vegetables yes you will gain weight but thats quite hard to do anyways as these foods are so calorically dylute but yeah i didnt lose weight by just going vegan you mustnt eat too much oil either but i think its the best diet to lose weight that doesnt include restriction or starving yourself,0
she coulda just titled this i am trashmakes more sense to me you know its a con job when shes on the kitchen floorher logic i cant keep a man so ill just on the bandwagon and be onesadseek help before you damage the entire trans community,1
that its fake is that the secret,0
pleaseeeeee stay with veganism youll feel so much better mentally and physically,0
uses the female to male snapchat filter once,0
i thought this was a fever dream but here we still are,0
unfortunately this is exactly where trans rights will lead former men will of course dominate female sports,1
hi freelee can you reply to me it would mean the world love ur videos,0
i love videos like this your positive feedback always brings a smile on my face,0
its called a tomboy,0
yea the people miss that it doesnt exist,0
what people miss about the wage gap the gap i guess there isnt one how could there be every company would either be in court all the time or would only employ women since they are cheaper this wage gap bullshit is feminist translation sexist propaganda,0
so happy for you i think its amazing youre trying this  good luck girls your going to have so much energy and feel so good youre gonna love it ,0
there arent as many female billionaires right so that also counts to the statistic,0
but fascist california bans gas cooking stove lol lots of cafos in california but lets distract everyone with a ban on gas hook ups governor is a joke,0
i dont know why anyone is even making videos about this because thats the only reason she made that video in the first place shes a master troll and only wanting people to talk about her and make her more money so by talking about her were literally just rewarding her shitty behavior,0
the people that say that prageru is a propaganda site are total idiots,0
controversial subject reported jk xd,0
im so so happy shes finally going vegan its you who encouraged her its your inspiration freelee keep going because what your doing is working love you freelee you changed mine and countless others lives,0
maybe you shouldve started as a vegeterian first,0
shes confusing sexuality and gender,0
remember their faces people they will be remembered as cheaters in women sports history,1
girl what the fuck,0
my god will you pick that booger please,0
should be racing with men not woman because than not what there are there men crossdresser,1
anyone who disliked the video is probably a feminist,0
some great vegan sources of protein are beanslentilslegumes especially in combination with grains like rice or buckwheat tofu is a good protein source seitan or wheat meat is also great if you have timeinterest you can make it at home very cheap and easy but you can also get it at most health food stores eat a wide variety of fruit and vegetables most of which for the record also have protein in them i wouldnt worry too much about protein in general most americans actually eat close to twice the recommended amount in a day its pretty easy to get enough definitely do some research on getting the nutrients you need because at first it can be difficult but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy if youre having cravings there are some good substitutes for meat and dairy products that you can get and vegan desserts are definitely a thing  there are so many great vegan recipesrecipe blogs online you can find recipes for everything from super healthy raw food to vegan triple chocolate cake some of my personal favorites are chickpea salad sandwiches stir fry and fajitas and dont feel bad about getting stuff in packages you dont have to o everything all at once start with whats easier for you,0
school teachers need higher paychecks,0
yeah maddox already took care of this myths months ago,0
morning star is amazing trish,0
i wear makeup about once a month lol,0
love it get it gurl,0
also chic peas lentils etc,0
wonder how much of the research is a result from phacking,0
in the top  paying degrees  of them are men dominated in the top  least paying degrees  of them are women dominated,0
i am so excited that trisha is doing this love her i hope it suits her really well and that she is happy being vegan,0
hey trisha im so happy your trying it out veganism is amazing you can eat so many things there are plenty of videos on what to eat many vegan girls eat  calories a day i hope you have an amazing experience,0
farmer on uk tv date sheep are almost the ultimate in renewable technology,0
before you comment that the wage gap doesnt exist i strongly recommend sticking around with the video i think youll find that theres consolodation from both sides and gives note to an often untalked about fact that fathers are not encouraged to care for their children as much as mothers,0
good video but youre using wage gap and earnings gap interchangeably when the reality is different,0
just create a different gender division and then watch them complain about being segregated due to their segregation,1
wait  did they just admit that women make less money because of  personal choices thats racist,0
hopefully what everyone can agree on is that processed sugars are bad,0
i was vegan and my health crashed many people have had health issues with this diet,0
how did i know she was going to make a reaction video to trisha ahaha,0
trisha who routinely mukbangs on her videos ,0
this shit is just crazy people have just lost their fucking minds they are boys with a weave and bad eyeshadow if you were born a man guess whatyour a fucking man,1
shes just sharing all the modern gender theory idiocy,0
ohhhhhhoney nowhat is you doinsomeone take her camera away trish you need to sort yourself out off camera if this turns out to be true then more power but if this is fakeohhhhhi cant say cancelled hard enough,0
watched all docs doesnt change a thing meat eater forever,0
so proud of you trish,0
so what if shes wearing the same dress as on the th of june doesnt mean its a troll maybe she filmed it on that day and uploaded it later,0
haha this is brilliant ,0
she didnt go vegan she was eating meat and dairy in her snapchats,0
a beautiful film thank you,0
i think shes utterly envious of jeffree  shane  the attention theyre getting,0
 ice cream taster and blimp pilot sound like theyd be awesome careers,0
i became vegetarian when i was  and vegan when i was  today i m  veganism still is the best decision of my life,0
this is a flat out lie wage gap is a lie and right up there with the pink tax just complete and total bs just check out any of the hundreds of videos on this or the few right next to where you are reading this or hey just look it up and think for gods sake liberals seem to have that in very short supply this is a liberal voting tool so yep you libs get this,0
the garden meats brand is sooo good  the fish and chicken is amazing my sister likes the meatballs too,0
k with a business degree bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha keep dreaming ,0
watched this video much too late as in  weeks too late i saw london and kalvins vids though so i already knew this was a thing that happened i just realized something after watching this vid compared to my first impressions after watching london and kalvins vids causing me to laugh at how ridiculous she sounded she looks like shes on meth given that high meth use can lead to various delusions and even an increased sexual desire i think her crazy thought process could very well have something to do with the fact that shes on drugs i hope im wrong if i am theres either something else wrong with her to show that she needs professional help or shes an expert troll playing all of us,0
no way no way no way whaaaaat but its gonna be so good for your health i hope these  weeks work out for you and are a good experience im thinking of going vegan but not sure yet please let us know everything about how your experience was ,0
omgosh trish i have never expected this from you lke i thought that you could never do it like for real but ou can wow i am soooo surprised and happy for you and hope you will enjoy it and continue being vegan after  weeks ,0
why men are so mad about this ,0
almond milk eat plenty of carbs and dont just eat fruit it wont fill u up xx,0
so youre gender fluid just say that and move on,0
some of the best food ideas ive found since becoming vegan were from fullyrawkristina,0
but why do women have less good positionswhy are they less educatedwhy do they take less paied jobs im not a feminist,0
ive been vegan for a couple months now and im trying to convince the rest of my family to start cutting down that would make it easier for me and the planet,0
spaghetti squash and marinara sauce,0
she gotta get that money  its holiday season,0
so why is there a vox video in my recommended category when watching this video are the bad feminists that insecure,0
whats the big deal just let her say or be whatever she wants  dafuq you dont have to understand,0
im a business owner in it  communications field i would love to pay less to my employees and hire them all women if i could pay them less but women employees are the worst ones to be on call they usually will not bother staying the th hour to finish a project i even have written complaints from the female employees themselves about  hours overtime im not sure what do i not see plus women really dont know how to negotiate for the salary just saying,0
she needs therapy,1
hey  white ive followed you for awhile now  love your channel i am a registered nurse canadian  could not have agreed with you calvin  rose of dawn more about the jy ludicrousness  was literally yelling  them when they were live on your channel because most of what theyve said  done is just beyond bizarre creepy disgusting  they said soooo many untruths we have a phenomenal man by the name of lucas silveira who is a singersongwriter  has been a trans activist looooong before trans was even really known about he has a youtube channel  a mom to  sons my youngest who has severe autism  my oldest who is gay  his significant other is a trans man both professionally but even more so personally no hate towards trish but the moment she opened her mouth  the beginning of her video it was overtly obvious that she does not even have the slightest clue about what it is to be transgender so sad when someone thinks theyre being so intelligent  so knowing when the audience can see right through all of it  what its really all about something i liken to the story of the emperors new clothes except in trishs case everyone saw right through alllll of her bs love your channel love you  if this is ever something you do would love to have you on my live podcastdigital radio show sometime ,0
seems like trish is jealous she cant join the lgbt community,0
i am confused ,0
i am so proud of you trish and i wish you the best of luck with this journey all you have is great for now but try eating potatoes rice and pasta without eggs it makes you full faster  try cook new recepies you can always look up vegan recepies on the internet or here on youtubed i hope it makes you happy and you find a lot of new food that you like and hopefully you will go vegan forever lots of love,0
make sure you eat enough im so excited for you xd,0
this is some complete bullsht these young girls basically have to compete against a man,1
 good example for the whole vegan community and how vegans dont have to sell you anything,0
females will be females xx males will be males xy they are males,1
i pay my men more than women because they do more work and well lets be honest here they dont s l a c k,0
if it was a man in this video there would be at least x more dislikes and sexist comments spammed in the comment section,0
how is it ok to kill an animal but not a human,0
they look like two normal black girls stop reaching and run faster,0
when i went vegetarian at  it was only gonna be for a month after that i did not want meat anymore i went full vegan at  and it was far easier than i expected i suggest that you buy some of the faux meats and cheeses to help you transition dont eat too much of them though cuz they are high sodium but it makes it easier to not miss meat and cheese lots of fruit and veggies dont be afraid to try things you havent tried before broaden your fruit and veggie horizons just have fun with it it is so doable good luck upload any questions you may have i lost a lot of weight when i went vegan i was chubby for a long time and i dont exactly look like freelee but my body has improved dramatically and i am far healthier than i used to be,0
fuck that sit out for a yrboys against boys girls against girls,0
ill be happy for them for making me lose alright,0
i just want to see a woman become a man and dominate men,0
hahahaha i love it,0
hum sooo how it comes that every woman i know are less payed than men for the same job  that means same task hours education etc,0
if women believe that they are unfairly paid less than their other employees then they should raise the issue at their next review they can take the issue to their manager,0
feminists hate hearing this because they need the wage gap myth to justify their feminism its their most convenient lie go on feminists keep choosing shitteir majors and complaining about less women in stem ,0
she reminds me of a fcking dinosaur like her face yells im part trex or sort of flared nostriled snapping turtle she just soooo oh my point shes boring and doing dum shit that triggers people to keep her relavent bc really shes a nobdy if she doesnt say dum shit,0
time to get aggressive is this guy not sensing the irony  you are what you eat,0
i think thats awesome go for it ,0
thank you for introducing me to veganism  ive been slowly moving into being vegan and im finally  vegan thank you so much for spreading the vegan message and helping thousands of people love youu ,0
thank you internet for turning psycopaths into stars,0
whwhat people who actually understand the wage gap,0
gender wage gap blah blah blah,0
its an awesome video  and we should really work on this to make peoples lives better i just want to put something out there there is no wage gap inside the same company for the same position its always about the average of different companies and different jobs but yeah still we should do our best to make things better ,0
anyone who says they dont have an unfair advantage is full of shit call me transphobic i dont really give a damn this is wrong,1
ok what is going on,0
as an egalitarian i highly appreciate this video because it gives me a clearer understanding of this whole wage gap situation im constantly told that its real and that its not real so this justifies my confusion,0
blair white youre the best always keeping it real,0
freelee is gonna be so happy omg ,0
beans pasta rice wraps etc have fun trish also drink a lot of water ,0
 not sure if its honey but oh what a fail that would be,0
this shit is actually happening yes,0
i thought everyone was exaggerating but no your girl literally just said im a gay man,0
your response was so professional and kind freelee im really impressed on how helpful you were towards trish in this video good job girl,0
okay listen she or he its whatever the lgbtq is about love and loving all no matter how you feel just because she or he doesnt know the correct terms for what she or he is trying to say doesnt change the fact on how she or he feels this is how she or he feels and thats fine and we should all love that no matter what also with what she or he are saying about the difference between male and female is wrong just bc a guy wears makeup dont make him gay and viceversa so what shes saying is wrong but maybe she doesnt know how to put it yet and thats okay so stop saying all this shit when you have no clue how hard it is to do what she is doing i mean posting it and saying how she or he feels,0
how long before this starts a ton of shit in the lgb community,0
all of you getting offended over a troll video  yall are dumb its a joke get over it this is why youtube has all these rules now cause of all these pussy ass people that cant take a joke get over it its a joke,0
try your coffee with soy milk or almond milk its amazing,0
there are a few things not included vacation time amount of total hours worked hard labor and also how taking leave affects ones future pay by the way most of what affects pay in higher end jobs is pay negotiated by employee and employers,0
wauw you are so beautiful,0
if i put weave on and a sports bra can i compete as a girl too,0
is this a valley girl accent,0
i dont think shes a troll shes just a complete idiot,0
oh god this is gold,0
hell yes trish i spend every day helping people transition to veganism and reach their goals would love to help you including how to eat vegan at el compadre   there are so many ways to go vegan and absolutely hate your life but it will also change your life if you do it in a way that works best for your goals lifestyle desires etc im in la and actually have a load of similarities to you and your story so if youd like some help id be happy to do so regardless great job i applaud you for announcing this effort arm yourself with information and surround yourself with loving people lets do this girl,0
yes klaus  co youve done it again thanks for your continuous efforts and for leading the way in the uk and the world,0
im so fucking proud of you trish ,0
im all for transgender right and fully support their life choices but we have to take a hard look at this biologically men are typically physically stronger than women this being said transgender is not transsex even if you go through hormone therapy this isnt about not being pc or descrimination this boils down to biology its not fair that a transgender woman who is biologically male can compete against biological females its just not even and its not fair to these athletes,0
gigis video like actually makes me so angry i am not trans or apart of lgbtq community but i  support the community so this whole situation makes me so mad gigi as you stated paved the way for a lot of the trans community on youtube and i just feel like shes okay with her mocking them like youve dealt with this pain yourselfthe hate of your own body feeling so uncomfortable the mental toll it takes on you and have experienced what life is likeso wouldnt she be able to see trisha is trolling i personally feel like gigi is letting down the whole trans community for standing by her she is her friend and she should explain to her that she is not trans and that what she is doing is hurting people,0
your hair and makeup ,0
wow i felt so lied to this was a great video and i feel a lot better in understanding that this isnt an issue,0
even if you mess up dont let the vegan nazis get onto you every vegan meal or snack is a step in the right direction i would eat lots of carbs try to use no oil or if you do use any or vegan butter use very little best brand is earth balance but just try and eat simple like a bowl of pasta with sauce and some veggies or rice and veggies or you could home make sushi with jasmine rice and avacado or cucumber and its so fucking good just keep it light and simple and if ur starving then eat some go to quick snacks i get all the time are dr mcdougalls ramens they are very low in fat and super delicious and healthy but yes girl such an awesome decision good luck ,0
awesome documentary thank you once again for your work to make our planet a better place  there is hope  greetings from the vegan desert of switzerland ,0
a well explained and balanced argument thank you for being able to intelligently and maturely resolve a frustratingly long lived myth,0
its not like women are statistically more educated,0
soooo the decisions people make to take a job arent conditioned by the education society give them,0
this is so amazing make sure you eat enough and contact any vegan youtuber on meal ideas if you need it youre such a big influence on the internet and i believe in you,0
freelee just looks so happy thought this whole video she just has such a big smile on her face and it makes me smile too ,0
so there is no wage gap,0
funny that theres more dislikes than there are likes ,0
im sorry but trishs fuckin lips bother me,0
men should really take up more of the childs stuff,0
i agree with everything you said except for when you said that if you think someone isnt lgbtq you just shouldnt call them by their preferred pronouns and name or believe them when they say they like someone ive thought that people have faked it before and i was wrong so i always just try to be respectful if they arent hurting anyone i dont care who you like or what your pronouns are ive some out to people i thought were friends and they said i was faking and im not and people have said that im faking having anxiety for attention when i actually go to therapy and have real problems also the part when you said that celebrities just come out to get more famous one person i can think of that didnt do that is brendon urie from panic at the disco he came out as pan he donates to lgbtq charities and he had the highest hopes foundation he also sings girlsgirlsboys at all the shows not everyone just wants to come out to be interesting some people just want their fans to understand them more and feel not as alone sorry for my rant thanks for coming to my ted talk,0
i cant believe people actually buy into this shit,0
vocal fry makes it impossible to watch this video,0
the vocal fry is strong with this presenter very irritating,0
honey the right word is gender fluid,0
i like porkbite me,0
women choose to do more for children because generally they like taking care of kids and men like working more hours and being the bread winner,0
thanks for the great recap of a great year cant wait to see what  has in store for veganism and animal rights,0
women arent equal in the us until the era is passed so this is just one issue of a larger one,0
ok then from now on im calling you a he because youre a trans man lmao,0
i love you,0
ive always wondered how aggressively women peruse raises and promotions compared to men,0
wrong sick grossprepare for flooding people,1
i was so confused when i saw the video,0
a round of applause for trishy ,0
dont hate the player hate the game f the system enough resources in this world for everyone if we use them properly everyone wins end the race bernie for president,0
trisha im attractive to gay men me jason isnttrisha stfu,1
omg im sooo happy,0
yaaass im so proud of you trish omg o i just went vegan a few weeks ago too so we can get healthier and help the animals together  also the only tricky thing about being a vegan is the byproducts that arent obvious like whey and carmine but once you get that list down youre good to go the peta site helps me a lot with that stuff they have some really helpful lists of vegan foods so id for sure check it out you have a huge following of people who love you so if you do end up staying vegan you would really inspire a lot of people to make the change as well which would make a huuuge difference it would be amazing  keep it up youre gonna love it so much i promise d btw i love you trish  youre my fav,0
look what shes talking about is an actual feeling that some of us have due to trishas past i wouldnt validate that either but she said everything ive felt my whole life,0
believe me being a vegan is terrific the cuisine is unlimited never ending options and all superb the fulcral part for me are the animals may ethics surge and compassion and finally the universal rights for animals may humans become humankind with this we will take a giant step to civilization the planet and our lives will begin a new reform and bring us a lifestyle which promotes the best in us,0
i hope she is going to stick with it and that this isnt one of her troll videos,0
since when is she saying at the end hi to zack efron,0
follow your heart and be who you want however compete against others like you of the same biological makeup win or lose that way it is fair isnt sports all about fair competition,0
jason nash is watching this like wtf is going on,0
finally not a feminazi,0
show me  company in the us that pay men more than woman for the same job and i will stop saying that feminists are liars and i will donate every year to any lying fembots out there just  in  that pay men more than woman,0
fabziy promoting left wing politics if you integrate that fine if you dont leave now leave our island the right is rising every day integrate or be enihilated you have  years death to islam death to europe union the british shall rise again,1
shes not vegan she went plant based for two weeks but as we all know veganism is a full on lifestyle she still had leather fur ect,0
definition of wage income received by employees usually headed on actual work done men work alit more than women usually and are nine times more likely to die in work than women less work  less money,0
so the white lady mad bc her daughter slow umm ok,0
they dont even have tits,0
i was gonna save this for when i watch youtube before bed but its blaire so i had to watch it the second i got out of school,0
instead of just blaming men this video actually goes in depth of why the figure exists and ways to remedy it if feminists were more like this i wouldnt have a problem with them,1
yes this is unfair they are dudes racing against girls,1
dont worry about eating to much freelees right carbs are good eat it up,0
just because u dont feel fully fem and sometimes masc doesnt mean your a man,0
tell me one company that pays men more than women for the same task,0
the sad thing is that the only people watching this video are the ones who already believed it,0
yessss trisha yesssssss i love you,0
if you have balls you run with the boys very simple ,1
trish needs help and she needs it now,0
very well done guys and girls amazing   pbn,0
yaaaaay im so exited for you and you are going to do so great especially since freelee is your friend she will help you out  its also so brave of you so do this video i remember when i was going vefan i was so scared to tell my friends and family just because i was worried i wouldnt be able to do it and i was scared if i ever got weak and just couldnt stay on the vegan diet that everyone would judge me and be like haha i knew you couldnt do it proof that veganism suck and i felt like everyone was just waiting for me to crack but i never did and i looooove this lifestyle and i recomment it to everyone  you go girl i am rooting for you,0
 i dont understand this doesnt make sense i think shes confused,0
greta greta greta greta greta greta great great great great,0
the solution is nanny robots if you elect me for president i will grantee you nanny robots phonzo cisne for ,0
i dont know whats going on trishas head and i dont want to speak for trisha but it seems like ts gender fluid,0
with starbucks drinks just ask for soy or coconut milk instead of regular milk and if you wanna get a frap just also say no whip cream,0
theres quite a bit to unpack here sure companies can hire only women and make their discrimination more blatantly obvious but i think taping a please sue me sign on their door wouldve been cheaper  maybe the wage gap is lower fair doesnt mean it doesnt exist  even with the same education credentials men still get paid more than women for the same job even aauw one of the sources she uses in the video said so also the point about men and womens common major choices is irrelavent because as confirmed yourself in the beginning of the video the issue is getting paid less for the same job  her final point men are more likely to work more hours doesnt debunk women getting paid less for the same work for the same hours now does it thanks for pretending youre going to address the issue for what it is and then dancing around it,0
trans girl i have no advantage basic biology im going to destroy this mans whole career,0
but its obviously not as explicit as one singular employer having one man and woman whom he pays an unequal amount its not that clear cut and youd be naive and frankly ignorant to believe so its a systemic issue we devalue womens jobs and have created an atmosphere where women are discourage from taking careers in fields such stem or medicine typically the higher paying jobs alternatively the explanation for the gap in positions would be that women simply arent smart enough to earn the top positions,0
i cant believe its being debated i understand that some trans women have less testosterone a similar amount to a biological woman but they still got a bigger bone structure and longer limbs giving them countless advantages in sport if i was president or what not that would be enough for me to put my foot down instantly,1
rice and beans,0
and now i dont want to go back to work my break will soon be over ugh so excited for this,0
the vocal fry and uptalk were excruciating like omg im going to have to tapout of an otherwise helpful video if theyre present going forward sorry,0
oh no leftyno no no nothis whole men and women are equal crap has been pushed down our throats for yearsnow its time to own what youve createdi want to see dudes in lipstick in all femaleoh thats right there are no genders anymore either right lol sportsand rememberyou got what you wanted,0
what sick peopleparents need a brain transplant these  sound like boys,1
well its equal between women and men because men do more and work and hours and different jobs that women dont usually work at therefor that makes it equal,0
try going to vegan restaurants and u can make anything vegan just look for a resipie,0
the moment trish uploaded that i got so happy ,0
bbbbbbut there are   even five genders triggerednoreason,0
feminists so often portray the wage gap as being about discrimination in the business sector probably because the gap is highest there the problem i have is how they insist on applying this to all men and all women those guys collecting garbage probably dont have it better than women working part time in a law firm but we kind of pretend they do everything has to be because of the patriarchy after all its all men oppressing all women rather than just people who have more opportunities being more likely to get high paying jobs,0
womens wages also pan out equal to mens getting smaller later in life due to an increase in  divorce,0
get chao cheese from whole foods i loved turkey sandwiches but ive opted to tofurky which tastes the same i promise there are so many recipes online for desserts so dont worry about that honestly cutting out meat is gonna be really easy for you veggie burgers etc are so just as good buy all kinds of vegetables there are soo many ways to eat them check petas website for alternatives of what you can get in places like starbucks etc going vegan is easy its probably just when u go out where its difficult but you live in la with lots of vegan places to eat at good luck,0
good video objective and informative,0
freelee please do a video about a beginners vegan grocery haul i want to become vegan but dont know how just yet please  love you videos,0
transgender state champs go figure,0
muscles glistening in the wind youre awesome blaire thanks so much for this video,0
so we should have more jobs with flexible hours so women can keep up with men,0
you should do it for more than two weeks though your body is gonna have to detox and its gonna take a while for your body to settle into a healthy weight dont worry too much about protein focus on eating lots of fruits and veggies and eat until you are satisfied give it time and youll feel amazing,0
how about wage gap in porn industry women make  times as much man lets talk about that,0
theyre like those kinds of girls that really hate each other in the beginning and end up somehow being friends,0
ah stk dizzlikes,0
craziest thing ive ever heard,0
fake old video this is done for views because frelee is being exposed lol,0
i agree with the state rules of those  states it makes the most sense however i dont think trans people should be completely prevented from competing with the gender they are transitioning to its a slippery slip but it just reminds me of the argument of it being unfair that blacks are competing with other races because they naturally are faster so its unfair,0
how do you know a person is a vegan do worry they will tell you  eye roll,0
totally missing the point here there is  a gender pay gap though smaller than  difference between men and women even with factors such as education level age race and job title in every country around the world i think the reason for this is more biological than social such as men naturally having more risktaking tendencies such as asking for promotions and women naturally having more caregiving tendencies such as devoting more of their time to household duties,0
i understand ,0
i dont like labels titles the video i am transgender,0
vage gap doesnt exist work hours  proffesions job type promotions and overtime are not accounted for it has been illegal  businesses to pay women less since the s if companies were able to get away whit it they would only hire woman real wage gap is between  or  depending on the field the reason  this is pregnancy and childcare wich makes women take less hours andor overtime there still is one but  an understandable reason,0
insert wage gap button here the wage gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full time it does not account for different job position hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,0
x and y no way around it,0
you keep saying wages but you mean earnings equal opportunity is freedom equal outcome is repression stop promoting forced outcomes,0
based mom is based,0
when i was younger i had a girlfriend to did her best to convince me that because i was a tomboy and didnt like traditionally girly stuff that i was actually trans she would force me to dress like a guy and cut my hair short and bind the relationship was so toxic and abuse she brainwashed me to actually kinda believe it thank god i saw the light and dropped that bitch,0
sadly shes not vegan anymore ,0
you go girl that should be the only thing biological girls say to them,0
great video your awesome,0
only thing i have to say sam smith has really helped the nonbinary community and im really glad they are making theythem pronouns known to the masses,0
if i could pay a woman less to do the same work i would only hire women,0
diets vegan or atkins are for food addicts that want have weight loss without quiting eating just pathetic they cut out a giant food group only to have some weight loss instead eating whatever you want and fast for a day or two days food addicts,0
yay trisha love u for going vegan at least starting anywaylisten to me though  do not do freelees raw til  ok dont u will put weight on u need to do it for weeks to really feel clean inside and lose weight eat normal levels of fat  protein but keep calories below anything freelee recommends,0
the factual feminist comes at prageru facts always beat lies always and a factual person beat a liying person,0
its not sexually bias its just who can work harder than the other it appears men work harder because we spend more time working than complaining,1
just fyi mens rights activists are pushing for more fathers rights if feminists just helped out more to push this type of thinking perhaps you would not have such a problem but right now fathers are more conerned about even takeing their children to a park and being a parent incase they get called out for being a pedo ,0
 anyone else notice the marvel movie reference,0
i never thought i would be vegan but it was the best decision on my life,0
i dont even need to read these comments to know they will be full of fuckboys,0
were those chicken and waffles good huh were they good i bet they were u fucking liar you cant even last  day wtf,1
i think am a guy cuz i dont wear makeup,0
girl boca vegan chicken patties are amazing,0
can we like this so we let vox know we like when they make factual videos,0
so happy to see this you wont regret it  congrats on this journey carb up,0
havent even watched this yer but i know imma love it,0
wow this surpasses the my life is hard tall girl ,0
so we just eating squirrels  like that ,0
your voice changes in your videos alot,0
hey freelee dont know if you watched shanes new rainbow taco vid but he used the quorn vegetarian mince i was squealing with excitement haha you should watch,0
this is sad business,0
dont forget though the common response to lower wages being on account of a persons choice is that women arent really free to choose what they want like men are,0
sigh girl stop,0
these arguments are just strawmen they dont reflect the deeper societal sexisms that exist in society which are immeasurable,0
even males are better women ahahha,1
now the real question is do you believe her or not i really want to believe her but i dont know her background rethinking a topic like this is great as long as you think critically of the sources if you want to believe something fact check it good luck this shitty world of liers everywhere,0
yes but why do female strippers  prostitutes make more money than the male ones,0
when are you going to make a video about your instagram,0
if you want to lose weight stay away from high fat foods and processed foods the best way to lose weight on a vegan or any diet is with whole foods eat lots of fruit beans lentils veggies brown rice etc,0
oh man i was so on board with this video until you decided to shit on nonbinary people ,0
sooo you breed and take time off and thats a mans fault,0
 men are expected to die in a work related accident each year but we dont care about that now do we lol,0
if gender wage gap is real why dont just every company hire women then so much cheaper that would be,0
you guys spent so much time and money on this film and posted it for free this is how we know youre doing it for the animals and for the planet thank you,0
this getting enough calories story is such bullshit i just eat till im full and have energy to spare if i load up on calories beyond what my body needs i gain weight,0
 you literally say that there is a wage gap of  cents which is far too much  there are still localised problems which much be dealt with  many argue that it is the fact that women are encouraged into choices is the problem,0
so proud of you btw,0
trisha were so proud of you the fact that you are giving the vegan diet a chance is a huge step hopefully you will become full vegan bit even if you dont we understand its just so crazy and wonderful to hear this,0
oh no trish,0
i call bullshit,0
k ppl are triggered,0
f it i have my problems im out,0
so hypothetically speaking a floyd mayweather could enter the ring with a claressa shields,0
feminists should stfu,1
well seeing as it was a women who did this video maybe feminists will finally see what people have been saying about the wage gap,0
i think the trans community is actually calling to her to say lay off the fillers you look like you have a peanut allergy and need an epi pen lol,1
you just lost half of your fansyour not trans honey we dont chose to be trans its not how it works,0
her backup dancers are gay now she wants to be one of them she likes to be like the current person shes hanging around with just stop,0
you need to eat lentils full of protein and other nutrients that are extremely important you also need to eat lots of greens also you need to try nutritional yeast or drink kombucha daily for b  ps dont listen to freely check out the unnatural vegan,0
yay freelee keep doing what you do it is obviousley working ,0
almond milk is gorgeous especially in breakfast cereal  thats my vegan contribution haha,0
is this another one of you satire comedy troll videos youve lied and lied and lied why should anyone believe you this time,1
 years as vegan and still going strong gaining muscles steadily proved to myself everything i read about veganism is true we dont need to kill and eat animal to stay alive if we dont need to kill then why are we killing,0
to be fair trisha does look more like a man than you do,1
this whole video trisha please do research and really think before making videos like this you make no sense,0
you say your going on a vegan diet but your snapchat says different girl lol,0
i thought it said vegas,0
why are people disliking this,0
oh nothis just aint it you shouldnt of even posted anything until you fully understood yourself and maybe talked to someone to clarify how and what you feel what youre saying does not match up to the im transgender there are many other genders i think you maybe classify more as gender fluid you said you dont want to be offensive but you basically making everyone who hates on trans n others believe they are all like this you could of went about this so much better hun,0
lol the eyebrows are a little much and can you put that cleavage away ,0
 when you put carbs in your body you become sick what kind of a stupid statement is that for a so called scientist carbs are not your enemy they are your energy the problem is not with meat or dairy its the over consumption and over processing of food in general plus add in an ever growing population on the planet,0
officially been trolled by trisha lol,0
glad to see that there are still some sane democrats in the world such as christina,0
wow im early,0
shes not vegan anymore please make a video,0
this is a girl problem actually,0
i cant believe its crazy fantastic,0
absolutely brilliant wonderful work,0
like trump said when women can do the same or a better job than men  then they can get paid the same women should stick to what they can do like housework and providing the males with offspring and making sandwhiches,1
so the end of the video basically says that the entire world should change the way it does things so that women end up with the same amount of money    buahahahahahaa,0
lol today on snapchat she drank soda and ate lays,0
the goal is educate both plant  meat eaters to try to start buying food that improves earths ecosystem on the meat side buy sustainable regenerative grass fed  finished ruminant animals wild caught fish cage free pasture raised chicken  eggs vs factory farmed on the vegetable side buy organic bio dynamic poly  permaculture vs monsanto monoculture doing those will make humans animals plants soil environment healthier  happier nature didnt get it wrong human greed got it wrong but we can change it buy sharing good info,0
this has been completely debunked it is a lie they dont want to go by hourly pay hourly pay the wage gap is insignificant they have banned this question look it up a man works more hours the females want to get paid the same amount for less work this is proven,0
im pretty sure shes trying to say she gender fluid like some of yall are being rude for why she may just not know and be mistaking it for being trans as thats the only way she feels she can describe it,0
rather than focusing on the wage gap we should encourage women to take choices that they want to teach them that just becuase they dont see loads of women in technology they cant be part of this in the end career choices change a lot,0
graet videothanks prager universityfacts by crhistinemake us to wake up and share with others,0
interesting explanation but the false wage gap at  should be  cents instead of  if im not mistaken,0
lmfao all this liberal craziness basically added up to men taking over womens sports,0
all these negative comments about she was eating chicken today guys it wont happen instantly if you have grown up eating meat is it going to be hard to stop but good luck trish hope it goes well ,0
you forgot to mention maternity leave,0
ugh yo im vegan but i some of this is propaganda the world is not going to end its going to look a lot different and worse by all measures but humans will survive am i missing something what is going to disappear that will cause the extinction of human beings or the end of the world ps again im vegan for ethical environmental and health reasons i agree with veganism im just saying to say the world will end is not accurate is it,0
hardly any days do i fill my arthritis i do not have scleroderma systemic scleroderma taking over my body i should have a home health care aide be bedriden using depends and eating with a feeding tube if i kept on the road i was going  now i rollerblade as much as i can with cold weather here in ohio im active im going to be  i could outrun in distance a  year old track athlete in high school  plantbased is what i do   with the help of this channel completely encouraging me more than you know god bless you allyelling  i will never look back i feel amazing peoplethankyou people want to know at the gym if im on actual drugs and i would love to say umm no go vegan or go plantbased you will feel amazing as though,0
theres a difference between wage and earnings you know,0

thank you vox your videos are and i mean it the best of youtube thank you so much for helping us to understand the world were currently living ,0
glistening in the wind lol,0
please stick to it trisha i know you can do it youre amazing x,0
i really want to become vegan or even just vegetarian but my parents are all for meat and after reading many articles and watching many videos i just cant eat animal products yet my parents are forcing me to,0
if you dont have nothing nice to say aboht trish then dont watch her like why hate,0
finally this is getting around,0
yeah yeah their personal career choices but what if some women are forced to make these choices women cant avoid having children can they and if women want to take care of their children then theyll probably need to take more time off work than men,0
you really think you know everything let her be she feels how she feels let it be it not affecting anyone ngl you are rude and mean and need to know some life skills and not just ti turn to scoial media and use your platform to drag her through the mud if it bothers you so much talk to her thats what people that are not famous dolearn from them now i know why you are in so many tea pages,0
isnt there an equal pay act in america,0
holy crap i was wondering why she was so familiar and then she stated her name and then i got so giddy because of it,0
youre just bored at this point girl,0
so inspiring thank you for this,0
this myth have been debunked a thousand times but to leftists that doesnt matter they will keep spreading their lies as far as they can,0
i am so shook i was literally in the process of commenting you need to do a reacting to gigi gorgeous reaction and there it was,0
there should be sports for transgenders because this is unfair and cheating guys are known to have stronger muscles and better genes than girls therefore it is cheating,1
im unsubscribing this is absolutely insane and has crossed the line this chick puts out videos saying she feels ugly without her extensions and now is trans because she put on a short wig boy bye ,0
honey honey just say youre nonbinary and dont use they them pronouns just say your masc nonbinary please,0
carbs carbs carbs dont be undercarbed eat lots of fruit beans tofu potatoes rice pasta yess try ur best to eat some vegetables ok ,0
vegan you tubers to check out plantiotic raw alignment mommy tang kalel claire michelle the vegan couple the friendly activist izzy daviz etc,0
just waaaaaiting to see if this is clickbait lol,0
companies want profit  the more the better let us say that a company could hire a woman who do the same job for less money why wouldnt the company not just hire women and fire all men i dont get it,0
fuck off your gender fluid then not transgender you bitch,1
can we share this to help it get as many views as possible i beg people tell us vegans to shut up and sit down but how are we meant to shut up about finding such a simple way to save this goddamn planet veganism is the answer to the worlds problems lets help people understand it,0
shes the transtrender you and kalvin have warned us about people call you two transphobes but are mad at trish hypocrites,0
i hate this chick trisha shes just screaming for attention  you speak the  blaire love you,0
has any research been done on single men and womencouple without children about this particular topic,0
trish yay the one think i will say is dont be afraid of carbs potatoes rice broccoli do you like veggies omg and try tofu,0
totally agree with you blaire i am very fluid and indecisive about my gender expression as a kid one minute id be rolling around in mud playing with toy trucks and army soldiers the next id be covering myself in my mums makeup and doing fashion shows with my girlfriends at  not much has changed lmao these things dont make my gender any different ive just been raised in s household where it was encouraged to express yourself as long as it was safe and appropriate but i am  comfortable with the fact that i have boobs and a vagina i am a woman and a proud one im very assertive and dominant in situations but i fully identify with being a woman ive had some of my leftist friends try to say that im trans or genderfluid who couldnt accept the fact that i am a woman these are the same people that advocate for womans rights and preach that you can be masculine and androgynous and still be a woman and yet also preach sexist stereotypes to indicate that you are one gender or the other like bitch im so confused,0
say no to equality of outcome kids equality of outcome is bad mkay,0
if they are xy and still have their dicks and balls no matter how small they are male even after extreme body modificationsmutilation you are still xx or xy yes i know there are other people with different chromosome but for the most part still xx or xy,1
but surely we should be asking the question of why women are making these worse career choices and why women are worse educated,0
lmao in your face all you freelee hating fishies,0
propaganda and clearly pushed by the jewish world order because what is funnier to the ones that call us the gentilescattle they want us to only eat plants because its a joke and keeps us weak more dumb that we already are as a systematic slave sick the food pyramid is plant based so think for yourself and not what they tell you is good for you the government is telling us what to eat its only leading more to eat plants and there is no doubt about that we need cholesterol saturated animal fat raw is best raw milk is awesome if you can get it organ meats and you will thrive beyond meat in the stock market blew up a ton because the intelligent investors know the future and what it holds go to wewantlivecom and see for yourself i once believed veganism for around  months that it was the truth i heard dr morse john rose drklaper drgreger drmcdougall what the health happy healthy vegan all other related and its bullshit,1
get the gardien vegan chicken sandwich its everything seriously,0
freelee thank you so much for showing me what they do yo these poor animals it took me  minutes to get through that  minute video because i was so sad and i was crying so much now i never look at meat and dairy the same without thinking about those poor animals that get tortured everyday of their miserable lives i plan on going vegan because of you and that video thank you,0
i have known about the wage gap for a long time but did not realize how significant it was in class we found out that some of the highest paying jobs such as petroleum engineering are primarily help by men and jobs like education positions are held by woman and they make significant less than males i think women are expected to be in these positions because of our motherly instinct what was not surprising was in some positions like serves in restaurants and retail the gap was smaller to me this job works in favor of women because they are more likely to be friendly and can get tipped on how attractive they are which is actually sexist in regards to the us men and womens soccer team wage gap the women in recent years have been more successful and have more winnings than the men but are still earning less while the gap for the top players on each team are not significantly large the further down the list the larger the gap gets between men and women pay disparity in us soccer its complicated states that women require more health insurance and there a pay cuts if they become pregnant andrew das  this is a parallel to what we read in the textbook businesses cut a year of wages for woman because they are likely to take a year off to take care of family members and maternity leave adams et al  the video there is no gender wage gap however argues there is no gender wage gap because the studies are based off of different careersschooling men in women have but how can they explain the gap between men and women that hold the same job and equal amount of education,0
go to supreme bananas channel she has videos about what she eats as a vegan and has a series called veganized where she makes non vegan recipes vegan,0
trisha do a bit more research before making a video like this just so you dont get as much hate maybe even like a small script just to outline what to say idk,0
oh my god trisha i love you and freelee and i am sooo happy that you are going to try a plant based diet for the next two weeks i was waiting for that  i hope you see the results and that you continue to look in this whole veganism topic to make the conection and you know what you can really eat sooo much you could eat a whole watermelon for lunch if you want to you can eat bread and rice and nudels and of course all kinds of vegtables and fruits and even oreos are vegan  maybe you want to look into some videos from mommy tang she makes all kinds of vegan muckbangs she has one up with food from taco bell and dominos pizza and so on it might help you with your babysteps ,0
trish   male female gay straight bi  im all of it trish  i dated bi people me  okay trisha ,0
trisha coming from someone who fully supported you for  years trolling or not girl stop,0
yet on snapchat right now shes driving by chick fil a saying how bad shes craving it,0
yeah right lol,0
for protein a vegan diet absolutely keeps your protein fine but i defo recommend hemp seeds they are super high in protein and you can just put them in everything also soy protein that is like mince meat that you can put in everything a couple spoons of hemp seeds is like  of your daily protein requirement google has everything im so happy for you good luck,0
she is definitely trolling again,0
i see the diabolical yet genius plan men are going to take over womens sports i wish i was in high school now i would have been a stud jock walking the hallslettering my freshman year in every girls sport i would be gender fluid and only identify as female when competing in sports the rest of the time i would identify as a straight male doglinninem up and layinem down,1
it just depends on how you define wage gap if you define it as women earn less than men then there is a wage gap if you define it as women earn less than men on the same career path then theres still one its just much smaller if you include the discrimination of females from choosing certain career paths then theres still a large gap anyway so there is a wage gap the debate is how big it is,0
she disproved the wage gap in the first  of the video,0
so in a nutshell its not sexism,0
theres a huge difference in acting masculine and being more comfortable with men and being trans this is glamorizing being trans who go through actually social and mental dysphoria this is taking one of the dudes too far trish i think your confusing attraction and personality with being trans,0
freelee can you do a video on zoella i think she could go vegan but she needs a pushx,0
love this helping animals the environment and ourselves by adjusting our food choices is one of the best feelings you can imagine,0
no ur not,0
props to her if shes actually trans but if shes doing it for clout then she looks desperate this is coming from an actual transgender person,0
really happy to see a section on vegan permaculture this year helps put everything in perspective  good work pbn,0
you can most definitely gain weight on a vegan diet same rule of thumb calories in equals burn calories out dont overeat your average daily intake,0
if women are paid  on the dollar compared to men why dont businesses hire more women then men or fire all their men and only employ women,0
when she says hi to zach efron is she actually talking to the actor,0
i saw a barista once she thought she was oppressed cause she earnt less than an electrical engineer,0
dont feed the trollll,1
if feel like if you live in a first world country you shouldnt even complain about stuff like this man or woman there are bigger problems than this,0
this is vodka by the way queen,0
coming from a libtard here as i know republicans call us good video wage gap is almost  a myth i would have liked to see an example of a specific job that a man and a woman share and their wages to solidify the argument but ill just assume that thats where the  comes from i do have an issue with the tone of the video though i get that pragerus audience is more republican and conservative but the aggressive tone and use of wordsphrases like myth and sexists dont have their math right are just unnecessary rude and alienate half of your potential audience the people who you might want to convince that they dont have their facts exactly right the numbers dont lie in this case economics is clearly more complicated than businesses pay them less because theyre women but an aggressive tone does more harm than good,0
if you eat a bunch of carbs youre going to get fat just saying,0
 somebody sounds like a certain former google engineer,0
there is no money,0
for  years vegan a decision of heart and mind goandstayvegan,0
my reaction the whole video is wtf,0
a min long documentary about veganism and only a mere min about animals  pbn missed the hole point,0
pc alert  pc alert ,0
im so fucking happy rn,0
at least if she goes plant based for this time hopefully shell really realize how shitty animal foods make you feel,0
one factor you didnt discuss is the disparity in wages between men and women and women of color,0
not much to miss about something that doesnt exist,0
bruh this is bull im just confused,0
when i saw the notification for this my jaw dropped,0
have you explored nonbinary or bigender as a better label for your gender gender is very individual and there might not be an exact label for your identity but those might better encompass what you have said in this video,0
i went vegan   is going to be full vegan ,0
well hes a guy so,1
i wouldnt let my child participate in the competition if that douchebag was in it these things have to ruin everything they touch,1
well put but i figured you would have made this a looooong time ago,0
trisha is a troll im surprised people still fall for her egregious shit if you look at it as satire its quite funny but like funny without the cringe,0
trish im so proud that youre going vegan as a vegan myself well im still transitioning i would recommend eating alot because fruit and veggies have less calories than meat and dairy products if you dont eat enough youre gonna get sick  take b supplement its in meat and not in veggies and fruit but you really really need it i would also recommend binge watching what i eat in a day vegan vids on yt xx,0
anyone who believes in the wage gap  dollar to  cents it wouldnt surprise me that they believe in flat earth,0
lmao i was waiting to see what blaire thought of this nonsense,1
wow they actually halfway explained the facts instead of just blaming it on sexism they did leave out that during this time one of the major reasons that the responsibilities with children were so unequally distributed was because this was a time when about half of marriages ended in divorce and fathers rights were being trampled on by the courts and fathers were expected to pay child support and alimony out the ass while having little to no interaction with their kids so of course if your husband is giving you a check your not going to work as much as the man that has to pay that check things have gotten better with fathers rights now due to men who fought for them with angry feminists battling them the entire way but hey this is a big improvement over five years ago when this video wouldve been the wage gap exists because im a victim and im a woman so if you try to prove me wrong with facts youre sexist,0
why are all of you so angry at feminists who protest like for one century or even less whereas men were generally dominating for the rest of human history there are exaggerations but some feminists might overreact to be heard by those sceptics and not because they want to exterminate men antifeminists are as well overhappy to see this video as possible evidence that feminists are wrong,0
and this is why im worried about the future of our world,0
whose fault is it just look at the liberals,0
anyone know what that guy is talking about  seconds in when he says  of the worlds leading scientists released a massive  year study on global agriculture can anyone please refer me to that study,0
there is no gap in low paying jobs thats for sure,0
search vegan meals on pinterest or something like that youll find amazing recipes make sure to have lots wholefoods eg potatoes veggies beans rice,0
after seeing those chicks and cows being thrown around that farm im considering going vegan,0
there is not a gender wage gap there is an earnings gap the wage gap is average earnings of men and women working fulltime it does not account for different job positions hours worked or different jobs it has nothing to do with the same job it has nothing to do with discrimination,0
trisha being a troll never heard of that,0
of course its unfair when boys compete against girls,1
trish please dont start until you know how to be vegan you must know how to cook for yourself first before going cold turkey transition slowly if you must,0
this garbage is a bunch of propaganda,0
this is the reason why women still from men i lost  dollars and found it in my gf drawer i dumped her,0
trish just go watch mommytangs channel she has many vegan recepies,0
i think the wage comes in the form of pay for different works womens work fields we know women typically occupy are paid less than fields where men make up the bulk,0
there is no debating live the life you identify with but compete against the gender you were born as problem solved,0
take the ads off if you are truly sincere,0
do they count all the men that have died doing more dangerous jobs and all the men in jail,0
waiting for freelee to make a video of this,0
used this to win an argument with my dad thanks,0
isn t she a huge troll,0
pro tip lentils are your best friend lentils cooked in some low sodium vegetable broth along with some good quality brucheta or marinara sauce is my favorite vegan meal right now also if you are worried about b nutritional yeast is the key it kinda tastes like cheese and i literally put it on everything,0
a lot of people seem to be complaining before watching the whole thing it doesnt say companies simply pay men more it takes into consideration occupations hours maternity etc im a conservative and find this video completely rational,0
have you even thought on doing asmr,0
ive long believe that this is a myth which is backed up by feelings rather than hard facts strange also that even when studies have shown cases where on a like for like basis women were earning more than men the psychotic feminists would still keep on habit i guess whining about women earning less than men oh and while were on the subject how did the men ever allow the women in tennis to be paid the same as them for about  the work,0
if a woman makes  cents for every dollar a man makes it would be too unfair because the man is only left with  cents,0
look up mommytang for recipes,0
thank you blaire for being our queen and saviour ,0
no this is unfair this is about physically mechanics,1
you can eat vegan chicken wings you know,0
sucks for you trish that you dont even have the moral capability to try something good for you rather slam down some chicken waffles and then later make a video of you crying on the kitchen floor saying how youre still fat and unhappy with yourself instead of just trying to better your health and stick with something for just  weeks you suck at life in general thats why youre  unhappy depressed and single and alone forever,1
because not hieing a man or a woman for that reason is illigal,0
how come we dont have these problems with women transgenders,0
im a vegetarian still trying to go vegan its been failing miserably for five years now but goddamnit i will become a proper ass vegan with no deficiencies i know i can and eww to the raw squirrel guys,0
watch mommy tang doe ,0
gender dysphoria  trans not really any grey area there and trisha didnt say anything about that till her apology video lol,0
i think its so awesome that trisha is going vegan and i really hope she sticks to this diet and enjoys it i understand its not for everything and i would never force anyone to join a diet that doesnt make them happy but i think everyone should at least give it a go there is no harm in a twoweek shift to a vegan diet and i think if everyone gave it a go we would have so many people convert,0
anything that makes piers morgan puke must be good in my book,0
who the hell is making over k one year out of school,0
 sure just run faster,0
the main points she used was because of gay too specific yeah me too men gay men does not make you trans the heck,0
another thing that you notice about feminists is that they often have this toxicity and hostility in debates as soon as you disagree with something they say and counter it with facts youre just an offended and insecure and most importantly mansplaining broflake or something like that basically all the time when a dude disagrees with something a feminist says he is instantly met with ad hominem attacks or other forms of highly arrogant and almost narcissistic answers i cant recall a feminist that actually started to engage in a discussion in which heshe actually replied to my comments it basically always follows this scheme  initial comment based on perceived truths  countering that statement with actual facts  ad hominem attacks and bringing up more unproven claims while ignoring the facts from the first answer  countering the new claims with facts as well  fleeing into conspiracy like excuses example well the patriarchy raises us like that when you showcase how the pay gap is a result from individual choices and further ignoring the stated facts or simply claiming they are wrong without providing facts and evidence to support the claim that the aforementioned facts are really wrong,0
men need more calories on average so they need more money for food a basic need this is justified because the work they do requires more calories on average so there should be a certain wage gap between men and women but there isnt one,0
welcome to the bright side ,0
simple dna test xy chromosome  male xx  female selfmutilated xys or xxs using performance enhancement should only compete against men,0
i love to skin potatoes and bake them and also rice with tofu and veggies is soo amazing and also lettuce black beans and salsa is frickin bomb glad to see youre vegan i am going vegan because im vegetarian right now i love you trish so much youre awesome and beautiful i hope you stay vegan you are sooo inspiring,0
i think i actually understand you not saying that i relate but i understand what you are trying to say trish what youre talking about is called gender fluidity you can be gender fluid it sounds like you are just learning and exploring about this so embrace your gender fluidity and learn more about it you have a lot to learn before you can not offend anyone please continue to educate yourself,0
i cant wait till this shit literally destroys woman sports woman havent even had equal rights  years  now were taking them back if wasnt so sad it would be hilarious,0
great presentation and makes sense the only problem i have is with the title it is incredibly misleading the reality is there is a significant gender wage gap however you look at this women work less hours do less dangerous work and essentially whine more in new york city young professional women make more money doing the same job as their male counterparts in addition lesbians and black women make more money than their white counterparts doing the same work why because they tend to put in longer hours but regardless there is a gender wage gap lol ,0
lol freelee shut the fuck up i am not vegannot vegeterian and i have perfect skin and fit body because i exercise not because im veganalso respect others opinion because it is so immature that you dong respect someone who is not vegan like wtf youre like  start acting your age sorry for my bad english not my first language,1
sports are not about feelings they are about physical prowess transgenders should compete exclusively with other transgenders done but they wont start a new division for them cause lets be honest no one would watch that shit and they would be ignored,1
the fact you made  dollars from the video is disgusting you should give that money to the community you are basically taking the piss out of you are a disgrace,0
yay so happy,0
theyre lowkey bad asf,0
wage gap mo like thigh gap tha bitch hella thic,0
subbing for this,0
i know feminists wish it still existed because they are still protesting for it,0
 of this phenomenon is maternity plain and simple way to fix this is fix maternity leave,0
people miss the gender,0
shockingly low amount of dislikes  people refusing to accept common sense reality,0
you can say and do as much as you want but some women are going to prefer taking care of there kids over how many hours they work and much money they make this is a good thing money isnt the most important thing in life family and happiness are,0
i guess sean mustve gone vegan,0
whats so ugly about the left is even if they accept these stats and that the wage gap is due to choices women make they insist women are making the wrong choices and run countless sjw ads like microsoft and audi encouraging women to forget about having kids or getting married going to work most likely for some guy,0
i cant stand her face honestly what the fuck am i even looking at,1
those cant be the  worst paying majors art history gender studies chicano or african american studies dance those are all worse majors to chose from,0
anyone who follows her says shes been posting on snapchat eating eggs and bacon just the other morning youre as fake as freelee,0
wage gap is proven biased,0
yea trish you go gurl  you will do great,0
i dont think gigi knows that theres such thing as schizophrenia and delusions,0
waits for freelees response,0
when i saw the title i was like whatttttttt but i am proud,0
how about transgenders in the wnba so we could finally see a few dunks there,0
omg trisha has really lost touch with reality wtf is going on here i would love to know what shane thinks as one of hisher best friends im so curious thank you blaire for not being an over sensitive trans woman and see things as they are and aint afraid to tell the truth i really love your videos and to hear your opinion thank you ,0
im sure there are plenty of girls who like going out without guys attention lol  not doing makeup or anything else and being left alone i am also attracted to more feminine males  and more masculinebut fem females  they meet in the middle doesnt mean im trans,0
this is very unfair,1
best decision for me going whole foods plant based i got my blood test back a few days ago and my doctor advised the following whatever youre doing keep doing it,0
i hope youre serious trish i have a chronic disease a plant based diet was the best thing ive done to help myself but it takes time here are my suggestions i hope you look into them make fruit smoothies instead of drinking coffees bulk frozen fruit is cheap and easy to use full of antioxidants which you def need c frozen strawberries  banana c coconut water same formula for anything make  however many you need couple it with fresh bananas with sunflower butter add cacao nibs make an oatmeal bowl with hemp milk and fresh fruit breakfast is what powers your day make it count smoothies and solid whole foods fruit in general bananas especally have been proven to enhance your mood if you feel good and are thinking clearer you will eat well lunch can be large too mexican food is fine lay off the corn and gluten though ive rrad they can cause inflammation in the body which you dont want beans and rice are your friend beans rice gauc lettuce tomatos add hummus and veggies like cucumber carrots celery cauliflower etc eat plenty of snacks nuts are great dates with nut better hummus and veggies salads are great too add quinoa for protein or chickpeas theres a brand called chickpeaots something like that they sort of taste like crutons olive oil pink salt and apple cider vinegar is a classic house dressing keep it simple and dont go hungry this diet is not limiting youll have things youve never had before and feel great too if you wanna keep going after two week look into detoxing everyone if full of toxins and your body needs help getting rod of them,0
everyone disliked that,0
i shaved my head and i dont wear makeup so what now am i a boy,0
i saw eden was supporting trisha too,0
you were born with a peepee and you take men in your pooper but you are disappointed when you meet a hot guy that is a homosexual wth,0
it doesnt exists thats all,0
dont forget women are victims of men since century like black people for exemple so if the gap doesnt exist nice even if other studies show the opposite,0
its almost like human beings make individual choices are arent just numbers on a spreadsheet gasp,0
going vegan was the best thing i could have ever done for myself and the environment ,0
one of the only ads on youtube that i actually did not skip,0
not wholly related to the video but too many people are worrying about gender pay gaps yet even if it was realwhich it is not why are we prioritising over this when  percent of suicide victims are men if it was women instead we would all care right but its men so who cares there are also many other problems men face that are not spoken about,0
you two men think youre trailblazers but in reality you are cowards,1
yall know trish is a troll right,0
hi everyone i need you all to support greta thunberg on youtubethey are attacking her youtube greta thunbergs speech at un climate change conference youll see mostly negative comments about her ive been fighting these people for several days now im vegan and love this documentary,0
rip blairs last  brain cells she is now smart as jessica yaniv really dumb ,0
what their d n a says should be the determiner,0
i shouldve gone to business school,0
ive seen this bitch floating around youtube on her massive inflatable tits for years and ive never understood how someone so ugly both inside and out has a following speaking directly to her you are the epitome of the dumb blonde stereotype and i cant imagine anyone wanting to be your friend associate with you let alone attend your funeral when you finally grace us by leaving this planet,1
going vegan is important for our health the animals and the environmenthowever when it comes to climate change veganism is just one step towards avoiding catastrophic climate changehere in the united states we have a military which is one of the worlds worst polluterswe need to severely reduce our military spending,0
nothing she has said in first  minutes has made sense so im done watching lol,0
rice  bean pitas i could eat those for days add salsa mmmm,0
uh which genders ,0
i like how women consistently report being more happy with their lives then men which is reflected in the suicide statistics yet there is this effort to get women to run their lives more like men,0
aclap thouclapsandclap perclapcentclap i never believe anyone who so ruthlessly abuses math and claps on syllables,0
cant stand vocal fry,0
this is bs it exists and i have seen it first hand,0
this made me soooo happy,0
vegetables  you may not like them that much but if you cook them right  it taste great ,0
wow finally a video designed to make everyone mad,0
so happy for you you should watch kalel shes not a raw vegan and has tones of ideas and recipes shes great,0
potato chips are vegan lol,0
im so proud,0
i know trish is just starting to be vegan but she should be careful with makeup because a lot do test on animals,0
and she came our as a chicken nugget and a teletubbie,0
i love this video  i will watch this video every day now ,0
hi im  years old and i would like to go vegan to help the animals and to help with my body and health problems any advice i live in a family full of meat eaters who dislike veganism so any advice would be really helpful,0
start with a conclusion and find an argument to fit that answer,0
bull had to ask but why constantly,0
i think the worst part of being a girl is this is controversial having a period yes yes you can have kids but eve did and opsie and thats why girls have period fuck,0
it doesnt matter this video provided factual evidence to explain why things are the way they are but some if not the majority of feminists are just going to ignore this video per usual and say the typical we make less because we are women and men are at fault for everything,0
yall realize trisha is a troll right of course shes not fucking trans shes fucking with everyone,0
i dont follow her but to me it just sounds like shes confused maybe instead of shaming her ppl just leave her alone to figure it out,0
muscles glistening in the wind uh what ,0
anyone else annoyed by the way she ends every sentence,0
i hope you guys know shes trolling lol,0
lets goooooooo vegan is the wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,0
one half of me is dying with laughter at the comments that take the piss out of this but then the other half of me feels so soo worried for her she needs help,0
dad talking about fairness what a lunatic,1
milli vanilli caught cheating again,1
this is fantastic  i really hope she finds the right way for her to stick with it will be supporting her thanks freelee for helping her love you ,0
try hot for food recipes on youtube,0
this is awesome trisha ,0
this bitch is so full of shit she cant even keep eye contact with the camera  can we just all stop watching this crazy bitch  i feel bad for her to be honest ,1
omg this is so great i know people hate your methods but clearly y its doing something go freelee,0
my number one tip is to stay educated watch forks over knives earthlings cowspiracy best speech you will ever hear by gary yourofsky secondly carb up potatoes rice pasta beans legumes fruits thirdly find alternatives that you like there are so many brands that make vegan meat i recommend gardein also there is a vegan alternative for absolutely everything just find what you like and what works for you it may be tricky in the beginning but it is honestly sooo easy ,0
if there is a wage gap why arent companies hiring woman instead of men,0
cliff bars are a great vegan snack,0
lol nice joke,0
oh god im cringing so hard,0
consider also as usually the job men do home are irritating painful dangerous task or seem as dirty or scary example taking down a vasp to taking down a vasp nest fixing the car painting the house fixing the house some garden cutting grass upgrading the house and helping it rise in vaule,0
i am a vegetarian and i had to unsub from freelie  she was such a bully got tired of seeing who she was attacking next i think she is dealing with some of her own medicine now as i heard her channel might be taken down  karma,0
but the thing is what do we call the substance inside of say a walnut its called nut meat,0
comimg in first and second place respectively are you serious this is such a joke they shouldnt even be there its not fair at all sorry but your child should either not be allowed to participate on the girls team and participate on the boys teams or not participate at all period this is not fair to girls they are not girls you throw on some fake hair and nails and now youre a girl ummm no you are still males males should compete against males not with females what is wrong with society  students identify as trans and they can come in and change everything around just like that this is utterly ridiculous,1
success this is wonderful,0
their is no wage cap,0
u should just buy freelees book,0
hun go back to sleep for a few hours,0
urrgh if the gender paygap existed the way a western rd wave feminist would want you to believe with their feels over facts logic dont you think employers would hire more women and less men,0
of course its unfair haha its completely ridiculous,1
ill give it a month tops,0
what horse bsfacts just look at fortune  companies and look at the same positions and pay,0
tbh how do you keep your kitchen so pretty lol,0
you can eat as much as you want but when youre full dont just keep stuffing yourself because you canthats not the point hope this help and good luck xx,0
trishfruit is good but you need potatos rice and beans to have the energy good job wainting for more videos on this subject,0
isnt this sad to know that this is the type of stupid crap that the next generation will see,0
this is some white people stuff,0
well the concluding argument was interesting i wonder if there downsides of make jobs have more flexible hours,0
i would rather kill a vegan and save plants that provide me fresh oxygen,1
bro in order to debunk anyone saying a wage gap is real just ask them if people could hire women and pay less then men  why do people hire men,0
im in tears,0
its more like transsexual,1
i guess its not because of discrimination like a lot of feminists say good to know,0
the wage gap is a myth me and women take other jobs voluntarily women take maternity leave off voluntarily you could just get a babysitter or have your partener take time off or just not have a child remember they made the choice to have kids women made the choice to do child work,0
trish this is fucking amazing well done eat as many carbs as you can to stay on track,0
wage gap is more fictional than the sword of sharnana,0
i honestly dont know if the speakers in their videos even realize that this is the goal of the platform but i dont really care either i watched dave rubin imply that businesses should be allowed to ban homosexuals christina hoff sommers suggest that gender inequality is negligible in the workplace and mike rowe advise young people to give up on their dreams based on those observations i can only conclude one thing if you speak for prager youre a corporate shill seriously any public figure however wellmeaning who has made an appearance on this site is now so far on the wrong side of history that when the zeitgeist develops a prager antibody theyll probably be thrown out along with it,0
so to fix it all we have to do is stop having kids right that way men and women can be exactly the same,0
she is talking about an earnings gap not a wage gap,0
her reasoning for being  trans is incredibly contradictory to the ftm community trans men who are attracted to men get attacked constantly for fetishizing gay men and people think that they were so obsessed that they had to transition and thats literally what trisha is saying and having short hair has absolutely nothing to do with being a man she can easily be empowered as a woman with short hair theres no use helping this dysfunctional hungover woman,1
prototypical business woman venture capitalist roflmao,0
dont get too excited,0
you should watch raw alignment,0
all this transgender rethoric has reached a deadend interesting to see how they are trying to make any sense out of this nonsense they must have a league of their own just like there are different leagues for youth boys girls and professionals,1
this is one of the best videos i have ever seen i love this university,0
best activist action monday fasting if you think veganism is a game changer check fasting,0
i really hope this isnt a troll video and one week from now shes back with a video on how much she misses dairy and meat ill give her the benefit of the doubt just look up the vegan versions of your favourite meals and have a meal plan also to assist with loosing weight you should exercise or just continue dancing replace milk with soy or almond milk replace cheese with vegan cheese although you might want to take a note of your fat intake eat lots of fruits and veges and beans and rice start slowly adding more and more into your diet if you dont like it,0
why cant i seem to find a woman who hasnt been indoctrinated into this cultural marxist version of feminism,0
i feel like she relates to men and drag queens and has some common interest with them but is somehow mistaking that for being trans like clearly she does not understand how things work,0
omg a woman is presenting the argumenttherefore shes a traitor to women cuz apparently all women must share the same opinion sarcasm,0
you will feel so good trust me  it mentally makes you feel better to ,0
watermelon bitch  that shit is so good,0
i have always wanted to have been born a guy when i was younger i even dressed as i thought boys would dress in the hopes that i would be recognized as a guy before i knew what trans was but i am not trans i know that i do not have gender disphoria which though its highly debated its what kinda cements what makes someone trans just because you envy males or have a fetish for gay men does not mean that you are trans,0
guys shes not vegan its on her snapchat shes eating chicken and waffles rn honestly disappointed to see her give up so fast but i kind of expected it from her,0
yes everything you said is completely true they high paying jobs are dominated by males and that is the point ask yourself why isnt that men are more like to choose to become an engineer then a women and as a women in engineering i will tell you that it is because from day one women face more challenges in the technical world then men do society systematically guides men to the fields of high paying jobs and women to the low paying jobs girls grow up being told to play with dolls and makeup while guys get building blocks and kinects i know there is way more to this then that basic example but you get the idea this systematic sexism is what the  cents on a  movement is about,0
a feminists greatest weaknessfacts ,0
isnt it interesting when you point out that a a social ill is not actually a problem the response is yes it is instead of oh great im so glad thats not really happening its almost as if some people want things to be going poorly,0
that the wage gap doesnt exist,0
when my mother gets paid k a year a man working for mcdonalds would defiantly get less there is no wage gap just find a better job,0
simple way to get rid of the wage cap change your major from liberal arts to engineering,0
i have a feeling that the larger gender pay gap in business than in other industries has to do with risk tolerance i dont believe their hypothesis that it has to do with flexibility of work hours in business markets tend to close at usual hours whereas in tech you gotta be constantly on call in case something goes wrong,0
that girl has a more manly voice than me,1
if companies could pay women less for the same work theyd never hire a man why pay a man a dollar to do the same everything that a woman will do for seventyseven cents,0
in my country ireland the average man is in employment for  years longer then the average woman last year there was  days of outrage over how after retirement men have more in there pension then women this  year difference was pointed out the issue dissappeared completely,0
theres lots of asain foods that are vegan thats basically all i eat ,0
 i know dang well you wouldnt be happy losing to a transgender if it were flipped around,0
so your saying,0
trish this video made me so proud of you sometimesmost of the time vegans or vegetarians can be brutal to meat eaters but we dont realise that we were once meat eaters and then we were enlightened it starts small i trust you to keep it up girl,0
powerfull ieconomic interests are behind vegans organisations please see on youtube how sintetic leather is produce sintetic or vegans leather how is know on the wold market all products made on sintetic leather when comes to is end as are made of pretroleo quimical components are very dangerous for the nature while are products made on natural animal leather are much more biodegradable for nature,0
so if  of women make more than their male counter parts arent you say men make less than women by  so there is no wage gap its all a myth do you even hear yourselves talk,0
also people obsessed with the wage gap i want to make this as clear as possible going around and blaming some secret sexist cabal of men and taking it out on your coworkers and claiming that theyre womenhaters or we is stupid men and women in theory strive equally to get paid and earn raises however a store that employs  people may have only  people actually in control of the salary those two to three people may or may not be as sexist as you think they are but taking it out on your coworker who is more interested in getting home to snuggle up to his so and spending time with the family and is doing his best to keep himself awake and in a positive mood while pouring over boring as hell spreadsheets or putting up with some idiot customer who firmly believes that  off applies to every item in the store instead of a specific product is only going to earn you animosity he probably doesnt set the wages he may even be mad as hell that hes putting in overtime and working extra hard but got passed over so the ceo could give himself a nice bonus he may even have a wifesisterdaughter who isnt getting paid what she should be and the entire family is suffering for it or hes doing his absolute best in his dwindling spare time to fix that accusing him of sexism is about as useful as getting mad at a chicken and accusing it of causing obesity,0
does freelee workout,0
i am so happy to hear this ive been a fan of yours for a long time and im also vegan i think youll love being vegan the benefits are amazing some vegan foods i like are gardein meat cocoroons svelte protein shakes and banana nicecream good luck trisha love you,0
i love this channel ,0
trish is always do something for attention love you blaire ,0
this is the best thing ive seen all day,0
someone get this woman a pay rise,0
i see that chikfila cup ,0
watch thatvegancouples video they have good advice,0
its not slaughter duh obviously its murder,0
if you want something sweet and are craving cookies eat enjoy life chocolate chip cookiesthe crunchy chocolate chip cookies taste exactly like chips ahoy,0
watch that vegan couples video on you i really think that itd be helpful im so happy that youre finally going vegan and i hope that you do it right so that you can stay on this lifestyle love you ,0
as a man the woman who was hired for my job before me made  more with less education and experience than me she literally made more than me for the exact same accounting job i dont think this wage gap is true youre stats are out of context of their papers thats awful science its not even science at that point nowhere do your stats talk about women choosing responsibilities or their perceived quality of life this is click bait id say stahp but it makes you waaayyy too much money and youre a woman making more than many men just by making videos based on stats i dont have to cite as you dont either,0
i guess im just lucky enough my parents taught me to value even the smallest amount of money even if there wasis a gender pay gap just be thankful you got paid at all p,0
this is amazing hope it goes well for you  ive been vegan for a little while now and ive found its best not to be afraid of healthy fats as i personally find they help keep me full and as for eating a ton of stuff its definitely not going to cause weight gain unless its oreos and other junk haha also on top of that just remember that for a lot of people it does take a while to lose the weight because it isnt a diet that restricts and causes it to melt off quickly its a slow but steady weight loss anyways good luck i know youll do super well and youll probably love the way it feels physically and mentally,0
wow im actually shocked vox a liberalbiased news source actually puts out real facts instead of the sjwagenda this is a step in the right direction the wage gap is not because of discrimination or women purposefully being paid less by male employers this was made illegal with the equal pay act of  it exists because on average women choose lowerpaying jobs are generally obviously there are exceptions less assertive when it comes to payraises and work less hours due to things such as maternity leave raising a family etc,0
trish i love being a thicc boi also trish i wore sports bras because i was self conscious about my boobs,0
this has the least amount of bullshit in a vox video ever,0
good for you ,0
mental illness over peoples gender and sexuality is ridiculous and ignorant,0
just go over the instagram and type in vegan foodu will be lost in ideas of what to eatyummy and amazingjust be carefulwhen u start vegan diet and dont know much about itu might unintentionally starve yourselfcause grapes and carrots wont satisfy umuch love and support from me on ur vegan journey ,0
my wife is trans,0
so the video says what everyone knows men are more willing to take on higher risk longer hours graveyard overtime and spend more time with their job for higher pay women are more likely to take on part time easier hours and a more limited job scope we get it theres no such thing as a wage gap thats just misinformation about individual preferences,0
if theyre comparing median pay wouldnt that be off of a limited set of data in a way,0
yay im so happy for you girl  make sure to eat plenty of whole foods especially carbs potatoes grains beans lentils tofu as much fruits and vegetables as you like,0
next womens boxing,0
react to can vegans swallow by onision,0
people are debating whether or not animals should be slaughtered for food living breathing caring  intelligent animals whats to debate im vegan because i love all animals  not just cats  dogs any health benefits are secondary,0
because men dont think women can do the same jobs as well you idiot,1
im a man then im not feminine at all ,0
congrats trish welcome to the club p try field roast  they make the best burgers and breakfast sausages also myokos makes the best cheeses everrr ,0
if two people have the same demand from other workplaces same experience same education same grades same connections and in every single way are identical to the workplace then they should get the same salary per hour thats simple the wage gap in many cases if not most comes because women value family time and social time higher than men do they also on average have more sick days than men do then you have the whole baby making period in the  year period for women if a man and a woman started out fresh out of university at the same job and same salary the statistics tell us that a man will sacrifice family time and social life to work more all these extra hours give more experience more connections and youll be more in demand by workplaces because of that in return that gives you a higher salary likewise a career woman that did all the same sacrifices that the man did will be similarly payed for their experience however another difference in men and women also determines their salaries and thats how much they demand a man will typically not be afraid of conflicts or stress in salary negotiations where as a woman will typically fold earlier and get a lower salary why because men are psychologically plugged or trainedinfluenced while growing up that men dont quit and women you have to sit pretty is it right or wrong neither each and everyone has their life to control if you want a career and rise to the top you have to sacrifice something if you want a family and time for kids and a lot of friends then you have to sacrifice something else biologically and psychologically were predisposed to certain things as a man i would love to be a stay at home dad and take care of the kids house and things like that however i work in education which also satisfy my desire to be around kids and teach with that comes many different advantages and disadvantages just like other types of work or lifestyles do point is that everyone needs to stop looking to blame others for their own shortcomings or sacrifices money isnt the only thing wealth can be measured in some  year old man or woman that sacrificed family and friends in order to build their career might have money but they dont have the same social life or family bonds again you pick what you want dont blame anyone else for that,1
they should compete with other men i wrestled a transgender he didnt seem to have a problem competing with other men he didnt claim he was a female he had that smokers voice that menopause voice i didnt know until my instructor said he was a transgender point of the story if youre a guy or have a dick between your legs or was born with a dick between your legs compete with other dicks,1
im attracted to gay men im feel masculine because im assertive shes literally just your garden variety western masculinized woman they all say these things ive heard these comments hundreds of times in real life meanwhile everything about her demeanor screams femininity shes literally just overthinking herself,0

loving trishs new blinged out nails  i wonder if trish will get dragged for this theres ppl that are actually transgendered lol this just seems like a scream for attention trish is a female that sometimes doesnt like to glam each day no need for the extra stupid labels trish always looks for something random to bring up lol smh,0
who just went straight to the comments to see feminists rage,0
gardein meatless meatballs chicken tenders crabless crabcakes and the fish sticks,0

i love this trisha,0
ok well i unsubbed a while back as i was getting fed up of all your videos  boring lame  stupid ass stuff that didnt interest me or benifit my life but i have had this pop up on my news feed going vegan is one of the most important things you will ever do and i will fully support you i hope to see  vegan  what i eat in a day videos  awesome maybe even advertising some vegan make up  that would interest me immensely,0
im not conservative and dont agree with most of pragerus ideas but there are some pretty good points they make in here,0
wtf that is so unfair,0
i know its a long shot youll see this but you give me hope one day mabye i can be me thank you ms white,0
sup with trishas bloated lips,0
thank god someone made a good video about this topic now when some sjw brings up the argument of the gender wage gap i can bring this video up,0
tried going wfpb a few times and i just dont feel any differentdo t know if im expecting miracle but the way people talk youd think id notice somethingi really wanna feel like these videos say you do,0
why does trisha look like she just got done with four rounds in the octagon ,0
youre so close vox i can see it in you youre so close to realizing that wage inequality is not a bad thing,1
freelee you should do a video to help trisha  give her all the info she needs to make sure she gets all the nutrients and carbs  it would also help people wanting to go vegan,0
chick peas are really good black beans too also if you look up vegan chilli recipes those are super good also check out sweetemelynes here on youtube cuz she has super amazing vegan recipes,0
this video pisses me off to the core not once have you mentioned real gender dysphoria in my eyes you need dysphoria to be trans i hang out with mostly boys too that doesnt make me trans you seriously are making the trans community who go through hell everyday look bad shut the fuck up fr,0
 the newsreaders clumsy script makes it sound like there were only  vegans in the uk in  im sure it intended to say   i personally knew at least  vegans in london alone then,0
wow libturds and social warriors have lost their mind  these are fking men  ,1
eat lots of greens it will help with the digestion and where you can get your protein,0
can someone explain why this video has a bunch of dislikes i honestly dont understand seemed like a decent factbased video to me did i miss something,0
i want you morgan freeman or drshaym as president,0
the wage gap is bull  women actually work less hours than men and i have evidence to support it women are most likely to get sick and take a day off so there is no gap there is just men work longer,0
this is a better way to look at it,0
omg u are gonna inspire so many of your viewers awesome vegan for  months now,0
how ridiculous they decided they were girls they decided they wanted to participate in girls sports im sorry you cant decide to have a chromosomal structure that you have,0
im making a presentation on this in school and i cant wait to piss off my liberal teachers,0
ive said something like this for a while now the wage gap exists in some workplaces but women in general dont earn  less when it happens its more like  less and guess what that  is illegal and is probably only still there because people often choose not to talk about what they are getting paid by a company as well as their credentials,0
this is why i dont watch the leftist media now i watch fox news,0
yaaassss you gotta help her queen banana girl  ,0
as an ftm gay man who is also a drag queen this is one of the most offensive things ive ever seen,0
sure  cents on the dollar may not be true but  is still really really shitty lets say you had a job that payed  a year and at the end of the year your boss came in toting a new company policy where all female employees are given a  bonus for doing your exact same job would you think oh yeah its only  not a big deal or would you be pissed that you were being payed less and told it must just be different choices that were hurting your income,0
trish go look at  they have amazing food recipes you dont have to starve to lose weight trust me i eat alot and im on a vegan diet and i still lose weight,0
woah im early,0
this is the one video that makes sense on this channel the majority of the content on this channel has a strange culty vibe,0
she is not trans i am a trans man on t for almost  months and her video actually made me dysphoric i am bisexual but scared to act more effeminate but while i want to be comfortable also liking men i am afraid people will think less of me as a man if i act a little gay and she was saying the exact opposite that she wants to be a man so she can be gay that just is painfully stupid,1
it is an unfair advantage just cuz your mind says girl,0
 is when my vegan journey began proud vegan and will never stop,0
did you ask to use this video,0
its simple women dont wanna work jobs like engineers and lawyers i go to an engineering school and the ratio is about  percent guys and  percent girls but when you look at the engineering classes the ratio is about  to  in favor of men,0
lol shit darling vegans are hypocrites despite eating no meat they still kill animals without realising it but well whatever makes you happy,1
youre going vegan because its trendy  ,0
absolutely ridiculous these boys are failures as men so they must beat women absolute cowardice bullshit if you support this then you are disgusting,1
individual choice thats where the sexism lies do you really think having women in the least paid college majors is an explanation and not a problem in itself  it reveals how sexism it impregnated in society because of differentiated socialization girls will be directed to least rewarding sectors literature classes for example in france instead of scientific section which is overcrowded by boys and have a very lower selfesteem than boys read sociology,0
if you need ideas on recipes i recommend watching raw alignment she is very inspiring and supportive,0
i dont think i can ever be vegan i dont have enough discipline im lazy ,0
is it just me or did anyone else just witness freelee mimicking trishas words at  of this video was trisha bought out ,0
i honestly feel kinda bad for her she is getting all this shame and i think she may just be confused no i dont mean the offensive confused that us bisexuals get labelled with all the time i genuinely think she is unfamiliar with the genderspectrum i may be completely wrong she could be in the beginning of her journey and for all i know she planned this for clout noone knows and noone will know so we are all basically torturing ourselves with unneccessary drama like when are we going to start ignoring coming out videos we all want it to be where people shouldnt have to come out or be labeled so why are we still acknowledging the flaws in others view about themself instead of moving ahead,0
i totally agree with you on the trisha topic but i guess its okay for sam smith to come out as nonbinary i believe in nonbinary being a thing i dont believe in genderfluid astrogender or anything crazy like that but when a person is trans and cant identify with being either male or female i believe its okay for them if it fits them to call themselves okay english is not my foreign language is themselves with v correct nonbinary if thats what makes you feel euphoric and eases your dysphoria hell yes go for it and with sam smith i just hope we have a positive example of a nonbinary person i just hope for some other representations than those crazy astrogender transtrender,0
but what about taco bea,0
well weed is becoming legal same sex marriage a black president and im still waiting on reparations with  acres and a mule power to the people ,0
equality of opportunity vs equality of resultsfeminists want the latter,0
i felt this video coming ,0
she makes a lot of sense until she reaches the point where she tries to explain the    gap by citing an example of a different variable other than gender and then somehow feeling satisfied that this means that the gender pay gap is basically nonexistent why does she need to take the complete opposite side of the argument and say that the gender wage gap doesnt exist at all why cant she concede that its possible that gender accounts for a noninsignificant part of the  unexplained gap,0
so nice to see such a positive response video freelee shows what a beautiful person you are ,0
you cant just eat fruits and veggies to be vegan you will have lots of health problems you need to eat grains and proteins and things that will fill your stomach longer than  minutes you should read up on veganism more and watch some meal prep kalel is a really good example she has amazing vegan meals and shes a devoted vegan ,0
why would she think that trans is on the outside clothes shoes makeup,0
sarcasm this video is bs show me one woman who is always on call sacrifice time instead of having a family and getting married in perusing her career like i guess like a man would dooh wait oprah,0
do i identify as trans  do i identify as my birth gender  bitch what that literally defeats the whole purpose like i appreciate her being openminded and accepting of the trans community but you really cant make a whole ass video coming out as trans when youre literally contradicting yourself the whole time and very clearly are not trans,0
omg please do a mukbang it would be bomb affffffffff,0
oh no i hope they dont make any permanent decisions because this is probably a identity crisis,0
so proud of you and trish thanks for spreading the message freelee,0
debunk the race pay gap,0
this is lit rally madness luv,0
i have to be honest ive never heard of trisha paytas and i have never seen any of your videos until right now however my judgement is seeping through just a little bit and i think trisha is  a troll  attention seeker because  shes crazy or is that offensive ron crazy people i have borderline personality disorder and someone in a fbi group mentioned tp and her bpd video so when i searched her on youtube i found this video and girl i like you you tell it like it is and i like your voice i like your demeanor and youre beautiful definitely subscribed to your videos and clicked that bell,0
i love hunting i love meat always eat in  i kill  animals,0
girl on your snap u were just in temeccula cali eating chicken with sean lol,0
hi trisha im vegan and it seems everyones recommending you the not so appetizing things to a meat eater like nuts legumes beans which are totally great but if youre someone who likes more meaty and fattier things theres so many amazing brands that especially where you live you can get substitutes at your regular grocery store some great ones for meat are gardiene eves and if you love ice cream some are coconut bliss so nice etc you can eat most potato chips and the best vegan cheese is daiya i like the blocks the most theres lots of butter replacements you can eat tons of dark chocolate etc etc,0
i love so much i have explained this a thousand times again i love,0
i think trisha and freelee just became best friends step brothers,0
fruit and veggie smoothies are good also,0
if these guys still got their dicks then that should be a first clue of not to compete against girls,1
i took from that last seen a female lion tamer female ice cream taster and female writer should make the same as a male doctor seriously,0
imagine your favourite food in the world mine was pizza and google a recipe for the vegan version of it you will be surprised how delicious vegan dishes can be if they were your favourite before also do not restrict if you want more food go eat more food if you want vegan ice cream go eat vegan ice cream this is the best lifestyle ever as you dont have to cut down calories because the food that your eating is so healthy anyway,0
wheres the proof,0
if the wage gap existed why dont companies hire more women for cheaper labor,0
why are there k dislikes people should like the truth backed by stats and logic more than a narrative right,0
oh ok who wants burger king ill pay,0
got trish in the thumbnail deepthroating a banana lol i love you trisha,0
sooooo if a team of straight trans guys dominate the sport there in what does that mean for female sports cause theres a clear difference between womans and mens basketball,1
leafy greens such as kale is amazing protein,0
trisha one week ago where i buy my bras from trisha now im transgender gender dysphoria crying in the corner,0
 love him that was powerful,0
gap is opposite women are promoted early to pump corporate management quotas those underqualified women therefore make less than their much older counterparts extending the  myth companies then forced to raise executive womens pay at the expense of males quotas and glassceiling myths drive womens pay higher and higher while any look across any management tier shows underpaid and underage women thus perpetuating the gendergap myth,0
her thinking that a venture capitalist or wall st bankers hours are  sums up the problem lol business is a dog eat dog world no one thats set on working  is going to make near as much as those willing to work more,0
this does not apply to any minority male,0
and thats when jason knew he fucked up,0
starches are your best friend girl  potatoes rice etc also fruits and green veggies  theres tonnes of great instagram accounts for food inspo,0
tofu is good in protein salads tofurkey sandwich chao cheese is really good alternative peanut butter or nuts are good for protein good luck and i am proud of you for trying every little effort makes a difference,0
the video is factional and all but how could you miss the way race ability etc affect the wage gap latinas in the us make like  less than white women and nearly half of what white men make this video seems to consider white women most of all and its even reflected in the clips of working women,0
tbh if trish can go vegan i can do it god dammit now i dont even have an excuse not to,0
lol this is one of the funniest,0
you can eat pasta with no butter,0
yeah yeah sureeee bitch loves meat too much,0
did you just assume my gender,0
also just type in your favorite foods on google but type in vegan before it like vegan pizza recipe or vegan pasta recipe ect you can veganize everything,0
everyone if you guys who watch a lot of vegan videos and called yourselves openminded i would definitely recommend you guys to watch a youtuber called goatis or his other account called svrige to really get an in slight on another persons ideas on veganism its not good to only watch freelee or other vegan youtubers for health informtation youll get a very biased opinion i know i did look at all sides of the spectrum,0
you can have so much food thousands of simple vegan recipes online eat potatoes rice beans smoothies frozen fruit you can even make vegan junk food such as nachos burgers ect but considering youre doing this to get in shape even making no oil french fries are healthy remember not to get discouraged and keep on researching for yummy healthy vegan recipes and make sure you allow yourself variety its the best way to stay on this lifestyle ,0
what the actual hell are you talking about,0
did anyone want to ask why the the male and female dominated careers make less money because social work elementary education are far more important to society than any of the high paying career choices yet they make far less also in the early days of counseling psychology it was a very high paying job even though we do a better job now and for some reason now its one of the lowest paying careers i could go on and on because this video is promoting the more favorable conservative idea that everyone has complete control over their lives and the truth is no one does,0
when have you ever said something positive im not really understand your goal you want people to go vegan yet you shoot them down whenever,0
you know damn well piers morgan liked that sausage roll he just didnt want to appear wrong or weak,0
trisha is the newest  transtrender,0

women should take on a disproportionate role in the household they should also teach their daughters to do likewise,1
minute  made me sick,0
shes full of shit,1
i want to make an essay about this but i need the sources for your numbers and facts,0
i have been waiting for this video for so long,0
there is no wage gap its normal for men having more salaries because more women tend to stay at home taking care of children while us men do for our familys need,1
holy shit i saw the notification and clicked that shit asap is this real life or am i literally dreaming,0
you all know nothing about animal agriculture,0
we can talk about the wage gap when we talk about the death gap k k,0
 feminists watched this video,0
trangender people have psychological problems,1
i find it interesting that the career paths presented as being dominated by females are industries predominately in the oversight and regulation of government not saying that the government doesnt have its hands in all of the mentioned industries just observing that the most government interaction is obvious in the female dominated industries,0
how long till she comes out as retarded,1
shut up shut up shut up,0
make reality fit my dreams when do you stop bending reality for them a generation who wont accept reality is sad xy is xy not xx,1
the commenters below are so bigoted and ignorant when transmen start to dominate mens sports like basketball football powerlifting and gymnastics what then will you do as your worldview of toxic masculinity crumbles all around you,0
you can get protein from beans lentils peas quinoa nuts oats chickpeas tofu edamame honestly i love this stuff lol etc you can google it and there are sooo many options,0
when women can force men into or out of fatherhood without any ability on the part of the man who will be saddled with alimony even if he never wanted a kid it makes sense theyd have to take care of it more more rights more responsibility,0
yes trish i have been on and off plant based for almost a year i am completely addicted to dairy and i have literal withdrawals so unfortunately i have always gone back to dairy i will never go back to meat though but seeing you doing this is giving me the motivation to do it too lets do this ,0
i usually dont like vox but this was well done,0
im sorry but if you were born a male u should compete with males be a female when i are not doing a sport,1
should have some hummus for your carrot sticks  best advice for protein is nuts beans and leafy green veg i usually toss some spinach in a fruit smoothie which is a great way to eat it if you dont like the taste,0
yes what people arent told is that the wage gap doesnt exist its a income gap,0
trisha female her whole like  i feel like a gay man im confution i dont think that there is anything wrong with it but im just confused,0
those two got no business competing against girls its not fair that they race what a pathetic scam phfff  connecticut and i lived in that sorry place,1
awww im so excited for you youre gonna love it good luck if you need any help there is a huge loving vegan community for you ,0
another thing you miss is that women tend to choose worse paing jobs,0
this isnt sexism its just common sense,0
it boggles my mind how supporters to these girls just completely ignore the fact than males are physically stronger than females this one fact cannot be argued against if you ignore that and look at the morality portion then you care so much about the  trans women that they completely ignore the feelings of literally every other born biological girl who runs in the state look i wish the  girls the best in their lives but that even they have to know they dont deserve those medals the crazy thing is this is he sports world in the sports world anything that gives an unfair advantage is instantly banned but their allowing this,1
only meat eater here,0
people need to stop making excuses for her the fact thats she uses mentail illness as a blanc card to do whatever she wants disgust me the stigma is hard enough with trish making us look like we cant control ourselves she makes me sick,0
wait a minute since when has she started saying hi to zac efron,0
girl go to whole foods the have so much vegan junk food i get all of my random junk food from there,0
trish please go see a gender therapist if you actually feel this way you still seem very confused about your identity so i think it would be a good thing for you to see if you are transgender nonbinary with the help of a professional that really understands the topic,0
what we all fail to realize is the possibility that women may not get these opportunitieswhether that be from being a stay at home mother or legitimate sexismdiscrimination or choicethe pay gap might just be an effective way to illustrate a bigger pointthat stuff appeals to voters and comes across as fact yet its notbut it gets the job done and is easierperhaps thats why politicians are citing it,0
i know why you had an effect on her i saw your videos on eggs im vegetarian and gave up eggs at  and started back eating them  years ago i became almost addicted until i saw your chicken video you reminded me why i gave up eggs i was so disgusted that was july th and i feel so much better trying to be a cleaner vegetarian in eating as natural as possible,0
watch the vegan corner a youtube channel for amazing recipes honestly theyre easy but so delicious its ridiculous,0

lady you forgot to mention how women still lag behind their male coworkers by  rather than  after controlling for age education and years of experience and theres a  difference in total pay between men and women also when you separate income data by occupation the gender wage gap becomes even clearer the biggest gender wage gaps due to occupational segregation are seen in jobs located in business finance law and healthcare occupations that are primarily self employed such as chiropractors the smallest wage gaps are seen in technology and science industries and healthcare positions with a small degree of selfemployment like pharmacists,0
hey ladies im hiring garbage collectors full time hours at hr submit your resume to me today  insert sound of crickets chirping  oh okay youre not so unhappy with your job at the mall clothing store making minimum wage that youre ready to step up and earn more money doing harder work got it thats the gender pay gap explained in one sentence women wont do tough jobs and for that reason they dont get paid like men nor should they,1

trish tip for singing you shouldnt be having dairy before a music video or recording the track id say leave a couple hours in between eating dairy and singing because it makes your voice a lot more breathy and makes your voice sound weaker then it is in case you didnt already know of course i recommend tea as a substitute to warm the vocal cords and relax the muscles in your throat,0
well i never thought i would see the day where i agree with a prageru video,0
meat is not a problem the problem is monsanto and glysophate hormones and antibiotics pollution wheat and sugar and piers morgan is a boob and waste of skin china is now making cheese and rice out of plastic next there is no climate emergency climate change used to be called changing seasons the planet isnt warming youve been scammed by governments and a hockey stick based on  whole trees no not ten thousand not  thousand not even  but ten actual trees worst scam in history greta thunberg needs to be extinct btw sea levels are not rising if you think so ask obama why he just spent  million dollars on  acres of waterfront property go through any actors closet and i bet you all the money in my bank account that those who claim to be vegans have leather outfits and or leather shoes in their closets i call total bullshit on them half these idiots are talking about having pizza instead of meat news flash cheese comes from cows milk and cheese are disgusting puss filled poison but vegans promote pizza idiots and still the number  killer of teens is texting while driving regardless of diet and vaccines are creating  out of every  people into autistic forget not eating meat you are so uninformed about so many other things meat is not the problem that said organic paleo keto and intermittent fasting are all a healthy option but dont get all twisted about not eating eggs fish or organic freerange animals make all meat kosher and then the killing is at least humane you want to get bent over something burning the amazon rainforest is a crime against the earth get mad over that,0

there is no gap if you consider habits hours education experience take a men and a women that have everything above the same they earn the same money for the same job why did you hide that in this video,0
dont be afraid to eat too much youre body will function so much better and process the food so much better if you are fueling yourself and as for food suggestions i literally live off of rice and beans smoothiessmoothie bowls and nice cream banana ice cream is sososo good and its all fruit so you can eat a lot of it and feel great and look great at the same time and you can never go wrong with oatmeal,0

guys when making the plan of such project start from the results you desire not from what or how you want to tell the things to the people i think it could been made much more effective,0
soo trans people may not be confused as you said but you certainly are just read something anything about gender identification and dysphoria before you make videos like these hating makeup or attention or labeling people or having lots of gay friends doesnt make you a transgender honey,0
this video is trying to prove the wage gap exists by saying wage gap over and over again while at the same time explaining what anyone with more than a double digit iq has been saying an earnings gap the video is explaining in a nutshell women couldnt work as much because their schedules dont fit the job therefore there isnt a wage gap they are simply working less and earning less the men made more money because they worked more that isnt a wage gap no one is slashing cents off of your dollar youre simply not earning the dollar stop self validating your ridiculous feminist agenda with utter bullshit even when youre explaining something else you delude yourself into believing that you are instead justifying a conspiracy if i call it a wage gap enough times people will believe it,1

is there a gender earning gap yes is there a gender wage gap  no companies have a legal requirement to maximise their profit for their shareholders therefore according to the wage gap proponents any company employing men is breaking the law by not reducing its labour costs and maximising it profit i look forward to shareholders suing the ceos and directors,0
i recommend eating enough carbs so that you dont have lots of cravings and feel satisfied whilst youre not eating animal products,0
gardenin is a good brand for fake meat there chicken patties and teriyaki chicken is the best  watch mommy tang,0
good luck i hope it goes well c,0
does anyone remember what the name of the video was the one freelee showed on snap chat,0
just another way to cheat,1
if we listen to feminists and really try to close the imaginary gender pay gap then women wont get paid more men will get paid less to balance it out people really underestimate capitalism,0
why dont companies hire only women then the same reason they get paid more in the first place,0
what people miss about the wage gap that it doesnt exist,0
trisha paytas is one of the biggest idiots on the internet this is a woman who asks questions like do dogs have brains,0
this video didnt favor one side or the other did it decent humans try to help other humans,0
do you identify as james charles,0
oh she mad mad ,0
you guys do realise trisha is a satire channel right,0
nicest freelee video ever,0
greens are the way to go carbs keep you fuller longer too and cut things out a little at a time or it doesnt last long so happy this is a thing and i hope you stick to it because youll feel so much better ,0
i feel like she could spend a little more time exploring and research a bit more time to find herself and get her words together a lot of things she said dont add up or just arent right like people that are referred to as they dont have did thats nothing to do with it,0
she came out as black im crying deadass,0
sooo  going by the school districts rules  a  muscular aerobicly fit dude who had been a great male athlete could grow his hair long start wearing skirts and say he identifies as a girl and would be kicking ass on the girls track basketball and wrestling teams that sounds fair,0
translation im in love with cedric botelho so now im a guey man ,0
cant wait for the next responce video,0
beeing a mother is the most important job of all,1
thatll last you maaaybe a day haha get some rice and potatoes lots of bananas try freezing them and making ice cream with them id suggest watching what i eat in a day videos from vegan youtubers bonnyrebecca mommytang clairemichelle stellarae and freelee of course have a lot of what i eat videos oatmeal with maple syrup and pb powder is literally orgasmic haha,0
freelee please make a what i ate today video please,0
she looked like she was on drugs her whole video im honestly just done with her  shes too old to be so ignorant shes sooo harmful to the community period,1
did you know that for every women who dies in the workplace  men die thats right companies are actively trying to kill men,1
booooooring work sucks as does feminism,0
trish i love you i write a column on veganism and i want you to be successful if you want i can share some insight with you this isnt self promo i just genuinely want you to be successful trish,0
so proud of you trisha major character development also almond milk and coconut milk is super yummy and very good for you you can put that in your coffee and i recommend veggie grill the restaurant amazing food,0
i think this day in age a lot of people want to stand out or feel like they dont belong so they will claim lgbtq and its sad because of how many real people struggled for so long with gender dysphoria etc for me i thought liking girls would send me to hell i think its become cool to a lot of people who arent lgbtq and that makes me ,0
there is still a gender wage gap the video is very good the conclusion misses something however the bestpaying specialties often require flexible hours in business for instance a high paying career is one that requires you to have a lot of meetings outside of your  routine given that women tend have more commitments at home than men they are not as free to shape their lives around their work like men so are there less women in highpaying jobs because they consciously dislike highpaying jobs and prefer lowerpaying jobs no because we expect women to take care of the kids to make dinner to wash the clothes to take care of the house as a result men are more flexible than women as a result you wouldnt hire someone who cant be as commited and if you are expected to not be as commited you wont even consider these jobs this explains why in science and research careers for instance which dont require as much commitment outside of  hours women do just as well as men is it fair its a different debate in my opinion yes it is see ya,0
clicked on the video as soon as i got the notification woooo,0
you look so unhealthy,0
when you literally said you felt bad for eating chicken and havent been wanting it then go and eat chicken and waffles today you have so many options in la you have no excuse to not be trying,0
vox this is why i love you,0
contrary to what jessica yaniv thinks periods are not fun i wish i never had to deal with them therefore i am trans,0
what r they so afraid of these eggheads r really showing their intelligence not,1
girl i recommend a bunch of rice and potatoes and broccoli and beans those are my goto foods to combine for dinner or lunch  im vegan and there are so many things for you to eat even if you think youre overeating you will lose weight i promise,0
lol first  seconds and they lie,0
justice at last,0
cheaters i i support the lgbt but this is wrong they have male hormones as they were born male so they do have an advantage,1
the nerve in monetizing this mess i cant,0
i see why  of black women are bisexual,0
that there is none,0
way to go im so proud of you  dont be too hard on yourself your not gonna be perfect in the beginning especially so if you fall off the wagon get right back on it and keep going dont starve yourself if your starving your gonna eat anything keep easy foods around the house ready to go so you always have something healthy get a rice maker and keep it going with rice in it all the time  brown rice will keep you full longer but some people prefer white do whatever works for you  keep canned beans and frozen veggies around too for yourself and of course the fruit but your already rockin the fruit,0
these parents let their minor daughter get surgery to change their pee pee to a vagina yup they are not even  and are still developing someone call cps,0
as a trans person this is sick shes just a fucking joke what ppl do to get attention i cant with this youtubers no more thats why ppl see us trans people as a joke cause of stupid brainless ppl like her,1
whats going on with freelees ig,0
vegan  instesinal discomfort for me    all day long ,0
 muscles glistening in the wind xd,0
im finally early  lol,0
wage gap doesnt exist,0
trisha paytas hmm having short hair this one time was nice gender confirmation surgery,0
im all for eating more plants but i dont think we should force people to stop eating meat if we are worried about methane check out taronis technologies they have the solutions to all of the climate arguments and they are talking to the governments around the world including our own we dont need extreme ideas just need to use our brains and create technology we need more co to make plants grow faster and bigger with our population increasing i dont think reducing the co is the answer but i would agree that we need to find cleaner ways to use the fuels we have taronis technology even adds oxygen to the atmosphere and im not sure that electric cars are going to make our world cleaner when the majority of our electricity comes from coal gas and petroleum we need clean technologies i do think that educating people on plant based diets is a good thing most will see the benefits if they are willing to try it,0
feminism is the  kicking of the cornerstone on the pyramid on manhood and this video really illustrates this,0
yes i love trish and i love you i used to hate your channel and as i watched more and more of your videos veganism has grown on me i have been vegetarian for a couple months and now im finally taking the final step and going vegan,0
i never thought u would succumb to freelee girl ,0
wait trisha is  wtf,0
hold up sis rlly be drinking chickfila sissy you know they homophobic rightt,0
of course she said it in a more proficient way then i would but i could make the same point there is no such thing as gender inequality,0
good chat they choosed a woman to tell this truth,0
what people miss about the gender pay gap it doesnt exist,0
be the change you wanna see,0
talk about being way better than buzzfeed,0
all the dislikes are those salty feminists,0
she came out as black wth omg,0
try chia seeds soaked in coconut milk with chopped fruit mixed in mango is delicious with this it has protein and an insane amount of omgega  its so tasty and filling it honestly feels like a desert but its super healthy also a healthy vegan version of american style pancakes is  one cup of flour  tbl spns agavemaple syrup  cup rice milk any non dairy milk  tbl spns coconut oil  tspn vanilla extract and  tbl spn baking soda mix then cook on a pan with a smidge of coconut oil so good  my heart warms when i hear of anyone turning vegan hope this helps x,0
 people who cant handle the truth,0
its not fair that a man takes over a womens sport,1
trisha dresses up as troy bolton on instagram trisha i am man,0
okay so you normalize for job title and years of experience but thats the problem men are much more likely to have roles in management and high paying job titles than women women are burdened with having to take care of children and work a fulltime job at the same time while the majority of men can just focus solely on their career and be home just in time for dinner to be ready while not contributing much else to the household and i could bet you that my male coworker who has worked there less than i have gets paid more just because he has a masters degree next to his name and because hes a male even though i have much more work experience in total than he does because our indian boss comes from a culture where there is a huge bias of gender and education title,0
just because trisha has a massive following doesnt make anything she says about herself  is invalid or done as some form of stunt for clout if she had only  followers she would be treated like any other transgender because theres alot that goes into an identity and just because one person has a completely different trans experience than you doesnt make your transness invalid a community is open to all not for those who fit within this specific frame or category of what they think transgenders should be if she identifies as a male then she identifies as male you can say your opinions to her but to now call her out of her name even after she told you her truth is so messed up and ignorant,0
raw till  is great but most people love the high carb low fat hclf diet and i think you would like it as well getting all those carbs in throughout the day makes you feel and look your best remember to just eat when you are truly hungry and eat until you are satisfiedfull because i know freelee preaches the whole smash in those calories thing but you actually can overeat so just listen to your body and everything will go smoothly,0
she looks like a gremlin,1
i cant stand her shes an attention whore and an annoying one at that,1
so i can enter the kentucky derby if i identify myself as a horse,1
blaire is really out here trying take my whole bonus check by releasing new merch ,0
you lost most of the population when you said its just common sense the masses lose all common sense and reasoning ability and go for virtue signaling and heard mentality thats why you see all these sjws and feminazis shouting this shit down peoples throats,1
what was not expecting this video at all,0
best decision youll ever make so proud of you yay,0
it sounds more like your genderfluid not trans  but you do you ,0
yup leftists are bad at math,0
so is she called tristan now,0
freelee does have a great body but its not just her being vegan she also rides crazy long bike rides  days a week if you were to eat her diet and not exercise the way she does you would actually gain weight,0
theyre are like foods you wouldnt think are vegan in grocery stores  for example lays potatoe chips and oreos,0
mais wtf les tudes compars ne sont pas faites entre personnes qui travaillent dans un mme champ  jy crois moyennement  cette vido hein,0
so proud of you trish and hopefully you get results like i did,0
please dont make vegan videos just watch others because there is too much videos on vegans,0
i know less feminine straight women,0
i have not eaten meat for over  years and im the best and strongest i have ever felt    ,0
if you watch her eyes she looks back and forth between the camera and the board where the script is,0
first off all when you see people being vegan raw raw to four vegetarian and fruitarian and their not over weight fat chubby or obese of course they will look good because they where original skinny and didnt have to lose so much weight they will look good and will promote that their lives are the best way to live where bigger people if they do theses diets or go on theses lives styles they will end up with excess skin just like every other diet,0
what is this doing as the add before my video triggered,0
do i identify as a male yes  do i identify with my born gender yes umno thatsthats not transit could be gender fluid but no just no,0
number  it doesnt even exist,0
wait so whos gonna tell her that she could just be genderfluid or nonbinary,0
dont do drugs yall smh,1
just please stop ,0
the mainstream media with their its a compelling argument on both sidesbullshit ,0
still on that globe ish ,0
you guys are amazing at explaining everything,0
im  in support of trans rights but honestly this is unfair to the cis females they compete against,1
it was chicken nuggets so it doesnt really count no its worse since it was probably mcdonalds and not anywhere close to organic or free range please research more vegans do not live on fruit you will lack vitamins and minerals,0
can you make a video about transtrenders,0
trish just likes to troll lol,0
feminists destroyed themselves,0
so these  get first and second place breaking all sorts of records along the way and try to say that it was a fair race and everything are the transgender that mentally unstable,1
no fuck this and fuck you if only you knew for a second what it was like,1
nope too much logic,0
aaaaand yet again a clearly feminist outlet obscures some important facts one men are expected to earn as much as possible to be viable partners two working longer hours equates to job experience three child rearing and household duties require availability and men being expected to earn the bulk of the household income directly negates that four  percent of unsheltered homeless are men five more than  percent of workplace morbiditiesfatalities are men six men on average work an extra  to  hours a week seven millenial women are outearning their male peers its interesting that people that clutch the wage gap so close to their heart never address these issues,0
finally somebody admits it,0
so u know its fucking offensive and stupid but did it anyway,1
being rational is sexists behavior,0
you are an actual idiot,0
freelee can eat a ton of calories because she excersizes like crazy and shes superrrr fit the key to the raw till  diet that she promotes is eating a ton of carbs in the form of fruit veg rice and potatoes and excersizing hardcore for an hour a day and being active if you want to loose weight on a vegan diet and not excursive that much you need to lower your caloric intake because your body wont be burning all of those calories off theres no doubt about it though that whole foods especially when theyre in their raw form are the best for your body and you will be the healthiest off nutritionally if youre just eating vegan not specifically raw till  or excersizing frequently i would suggest to eating so that the bulk of your diet comes from fruit and veggies cooked or uncooked with some brown rice  potatoes accompanying it and once in a while adding in some beans and rarely some nutsseeds you dont have to worry about protein deficiency because it literally doesnt exist since everything you eat has protein in it dont cook with any oil and try not to add salt to any food youre eating thats to loose weight if youre going to fall off the wagon and are thinking about stopping being vegan its good to educate yourself more on the ethical reasons why a vegan diet is so good watching forks over knives gary yourofksys speech on youtube called the best speech you will ever hear earthlings and other things will help also as well if youre feeling like youre going to fall off the wagon because you really want to eat your favourite   try looking for a vegan version of that in the grocery store lots of times the vegan version of things are really tasty and helps the transition or have some pasta or bread nonwhole foods carb options these things are not recommended for loosing weight though thats more for the rare treat or once youve reached your goal weight to loose weight cut out the alcohol up your water intake to about l a day a big l or l water bottle really helps with this and drink l of that water with lemon each morning before you eat breakfast maybe drink it while you go for a walk first thing after you wake up and then come back to eat and make sure youre getting adequate sleep and try to avoid stress hope this helps ,0
trisha has bpd so an identity crisis is just another day for her its an attention thing so dont take it on too much blaire,0
love this message thanks freelee  i went vegan partly bc of your videos and the amazing way you spread your message without being mean and a pessimist like some others ive seen would love to meet you someday come to seattle,0
wage gap is a lie,0
guys do you know how do they make these statistics i mean do they put in consideration the type of jobs the extra hours etc,0
why does freely talk like she invented vegan life style omg,0
omg i never expected this you go girl youll feel great but dont try to go fully raw the first few days because youll feel restricted and youll just crash good luck,0
lmfao she is a very handsome,0
no disrespect but it sounds more like gender fluidity than transgender but you know you better than me just saying what i thought about how you described everything much love trish keep doing you boo ,0
freele is gonna rave about this,0
trisha vegetarian  vegan is soo haard coz u cant have any milk chees or anything and you should eat fish for protein that kind of transision can be really hars on ur body,0
   you could literally end the video right there,0
its actually really easy you can essentially eat everything except meat and dairy i dont like cheese  so it was easy for me but for the most part you can eat as much as you want,0
stop going into gender studies so you can get a job that actually matters,0
also get b supplements or u can become anemic,0
i dont understand we should make more jobs more flexible which may or may not be beneficial or cost effective because it looks better on a graph,0
 what you mean no study can cover them all a scientific experiment can eliminate many variables for example there is study that can cover them all there are experiment that let hr evaluate identical resumes of either having a male or female name the resume with male name usually have a higher income or acceptance rate,0
got to say it is funny how these studies only look at less common and higher paying jobs i would love to see data from more common job sectors,0
its insane how many stupid people watched this video and missed the entire point it really is sad,0
i love how its all men saying the age gap doesnt exist lmao,0
last thanksgiving  i was the only plant based eater in my family and this thanksgiving we had  of my family members join me so excited to see the growth and the health in my family,0
you can also get frapps with soymilka ned no whip cream,0
you know what trisha this is the best thing ive heard this day  my tips for you  mainly eat fruits  vegetables and aside of that additionally eat carb stuff like rice bread pasta potatoes etc  eat enough  a human needs    caloriesday if you feel tired or develop cravings its because you eat not enough caloriesday or not enough carbs  drink a lot of water best thing when you wake up start the day with drinking water because you got dehydrated in the course of the night,0
its a man wearing a weave if thats fair then whats the point of separating boys from girls in the first place just have co ed track because thats what this is,0
you know shes a troll right,0
they made a movie about how this is cheating its called juwanna mann,1
so were the fuck are the feminist women r getting fucked by men out here and they wont say shit,1
go vegan  its sooo easy and soooo yummy i love it,0
im eating mongolian beef tacos while watching this,0
shes eating fried chicken right now with waffles she if full of it freelee i cant stand how greedy and gross she is she is going to suffer for health problems she is already there,0
 triggered feminists disliked this video,0
totally pro trans but not in playing womens sports its wildly unfair im gay i have to accept the fact me and my partner will never a child thats half himhalf me its just a fact acting like it isnt is silly a transwomen shouldnt compete agains bio women its just not fair,1
i think this also lets two genders think different from different opportunities employment and by how much they all work although thats me ,0
as a polyamorous pansexual unicorn i want the right to give birth to a child,0
wait no ones asking the important question here though will you be participating in no nut november now,0
hey freelee i love that you do these videos to new vegans but have you thought about doing like one video a week to a new vegan on youtube who is trying to go vegan that is not well known i think that you could reach so many people out there and help spread the message even more just bc so many people look up to you i know you helped me to go vegan and ive lost lbs since but it would be cool if you did just a thought happy wednesday,0
now this is a woman i would want for president,0
i support the transgender community but come on biologically they do have an advantage not discrimination,1
physically and chemically transgender will always have an advantage level thats it make your own sports transgendered sports league and you can compete with each other fairly ,1
always remember that just because theres a vegan label on a product doesnt mean its super healthy you cant expect to not gain wait if you eat vegan junk food good luck trish hopefully you carry on your vegan journey even after your music video i wish you the best ,0
any advice for people who want to go vegan but have a deadly allergy to peanuts tree nuts and soybeans a friend of mine tried to go vegan without these things but she had a serious protein deficiency and had to go to the er after fainting she cant take protein supplementspowders either because she is also allergic to the binding product in it,0
their response to whether they would be upset if they were born girls and trans females starting beating them at track  was a complete lie we all know they would be pissed and rightfully so we need to look at the fact instead of trying to protect the butthurt people,1
the amount of boob jobs and naked photos shes donehad shes not trans ,0
thought it was too good to be true but im so happy youre doing this i eat tonsss of rice and pasta but whole foods has a lot of vegan junk food like cupcakes and mac and cheese that are really good not the healthiest but it definitely helps if youre craving it jealous of all the good restaurants you have out in la too ,0
this is ridiculous co does not correlate with temperature however cars planes and factories pollute the environment but what about testing bombs using weapons that also pollute the environment,0
i do love that household chores are listed but yard work isnt how about auto maintenance building projects diy chores im a stay at home dad and my wife still does way more household chores than i do but its not because shes oppressed but because she is willing to clean the whole house if i do the bathroom cleaning the bathroom sucks and it gross but it takes me like an hour a week so i just do it its the same deal with mowing the lawn ive never brought up doing it to her other than to make the point about what i do around the house because i like doing it i take a great deal of pride in my yard but when it comes to cleaning out the dog kennel bernese mountain dog bernese cross two boston terriers and i run a doggy daycare that sucks but it still needs to be done again it buys me a lot of chore credit so i accept it and just do it the problem with assessing peoples personal choices at home is the lack of context my wife would love to stay home clean the house and take care of children but she got a really good job that turned into a great career and its not cost effective if women arent on your equality bandwagon thats fine its time you stop worrying about such stupid things,0
vox failing at math again women dont make less than men they earn less than men men on average work longer hours get sick less take fewer holidays and dont have to push human beings out of their bodies its illegal to pay people different wages for the same job dummies,0
these transgender athletes are narcissists of course they think its fair theyre winning,1
fruit is great but it wont fill you up throw in sweet potatoes green veggies whole wheat grains,0
i had to come back to this video to re strengthen my sanity after having my civicshistory teacher brainwash my whole class about this,0
bitchy jewish girl voice theres going to be some bullshit here,1
vegan cannot be bad if it can i would like to know,0
well done thank you for your dedication and commitment to helping our mother earth to heal helping her non human animal kingdom to gain the respect and consideration it deserves and by doing so helping to restore humanitys collective soul keep on keeping on with the great works,0
none of this is relevant outside the usa,0
why is she eating chick fil a ummm hello,0
this is stupid smh they are men m,0
to become vegan was the best decision of my life i love this so much,0
men and women should be equal you cant hit me im a girl what youre a man no your opinion doesnt matter on mens issues feminists lmao,0
i feel bad for myself that i am a woman and i have make really big choices in life like to pause my career to bear a child,0
this is great trisha and freelee re friends yay                   ,0
even though i do lean left its pretty obvious the wag gap is bs then again feminism as a whole is bs,0
god youve reached a new level of disgusting,0
there is no such thing as a wage gap men simply work more statistically work harder jobs  of deaths and injuries on a workplace is men this id because women simply dont want to have these jobs and generally work less than men so there is no wage gap men just work harder and that is a statistical fact and i dont care what you say yes there are women who work hard but not as much as men so this whole wage gap thing is just bs that women want us to believe to give them even more of what they want stop using your gender as an excuse and if you use taking care of a child as an argument you are even more ridiculous dont have kids then if you want to pursue a career,0
im pretty sure billy eilish is not vegan she might eat plant based but i think she wears animal products,0
dont get too excited guys tomorrow shell get mcdonalds and do a watch me eat video,0
i like this women,0
this shows you that men are men and women are women waiting for triggered people to come in my comment section,0
i am so fucking proud of you,0
until you take away personal choice from women their will be a wage gap force them all into stem and make birth control mandatory,1
damn the script comes in clutch now i can just copy and paste my comebacks lol,0
all of prager u is right wing propaganda,0
there is a study in germany that says that woman earn  les with the same backround,0
lmfao  they have a dick  they should be totally ashamed of themselves sissy boys,1
thank you for this everyone needed this to prove the feminists wrong,0
watch the the video you dumbasses it clearly states that the debate about wage gap cannot be summed up in a sentence,0
vegan since ,0
this is such old news and a really a red herring,0
hahahahahahahahahhahahaha this is so cute,0
just because you feel like a girl dont mean youre a girl  why people gotta make shit complicated ,0
men are wired to be vicious aggressive  protective that is how humans survive thousands of years ago with those sabertooth tigers lurking just outside your backyard apply those alpha male traits in the business and you get those male dominated ceos in business the big boss cannot wink fold and be weak otherwise the competitors and even business partners will eat himher alive testosterone makes a big difference as well,0
i am so so proud of you omg yes trish,0
how does this have dislikes,0
 the actual wage gap shrinks to only  cents or there is no gender wage gap pick one,0
i cant believe this wage gap myth is still going on,0
guys please keep in mind that this is the same bitch that asked if dogs had brains,1
also its easy to find vegan thai food and sushi oreos are already vegan so u can eat those look up vegan fast food orders too not the healthiest but everyone gets tempted when u go to a fast food restaurant so its good to have an order down so u dont cheat,0
do i hate chicken yes  do i eat it daily yes ,0
 i consistently get the oh my god i didnt know you were straight it hurts especially when my first interaction with them is normally flirty maybe if i follow trishas logic im a transgender stripper,0
i hope she still goes through with it although she is in the middle of a really bad breakup right now,0
the wage gap doesnt exist,0
lol go cry on that floor fuck off with this shit,1
why do people think they can do these little surveys and make a huge and mostly missleading conclusions their are simply too many variables that effect the results in a large way that have not even been concidered in a simple physics expirement that might have  controlled variables you still need to be pretty spot of to get even close to the theoretical values with the practical aspects to really have an accurate surveys you would need to take into account almost everything like qualifications if your comparing something like running a business its even more difficult this is what happens when you teach the socialists statistics,0
this is so great  raw till  is great for weight loss ive also heard a lottttt of people lose weight on the starch solution as well you should do some research on that either way youre going to look and feel amazing,0
yes spread the message,0
women shouldnt even be allowed to work we wouldnt have this stupid myth if we just kept women at home in the first place,1
it is unfairthose two people feel like girls but their not girlsthey are biological boysperiod  simple to understand,0
good info but this narrators voice is annoying at the end of each sentence valley girlish,0
love the choice of music  love massive attack and goldfrapp just saw ma in detroit for the mixtape show,0
its just too complicated to fully understand i want everything to be fair but am just not sure about whats wrong and right,0
pasta rice lentils legumes  delishous,0
ahhh i hope freelee that vegan couple and sorsha see this because it is lit so proud of you trisha make sure you stay carbed up and keep variety in your diet it makes it so much easier to maintain a plantbased lifestyle you cannot go wrong with rice potatoes beans and smoothies,0
there are so many vegan options for not vegan foods,0
i have a phobia of make up i must be a man c how do i to tell my fiance,0
maybe shes gender fluid i dont know but im seeing people share their stories with coming out and comparing each others and such instead of bashing her educate her,0
finding meat the deli is super easy finding meat at restaurants is super easy i always say could you slit a cows throat peel its skin off and then grill the steak could you chop a chickens head off and de feather it i guarantee if people eating meat had to do it themselves we would mostly be vegans mostly because some cant feel from my understanding serial killers have that issue,0
why do they never link the damn sources,0
as a black man i am disgusted these are men the father and mother with low morals teach your kids how to be the correct sex they were born disgusing shit,1
thats not transgender u fucking fool,1
oh nigga u gay,1
basically the wage gap statistics didnt consider many factors like working hours and choices of industries and many more so the  thing is fake,0
thank you ms sommers youre videos are excellent and i greatly appreciate you taking your time to make this and thanks to the editors and artists extremely well put together,0
came here just to like,0
we need more woman like her p,0
literally just looked at ur sc and youre eating chicken and waffles you chat so much shit,1
these sick fucks will be delt with during the cw this is the poison that helps rot peoples minds fucking cheeters,1
those  are the milli vanilli of trannnies and if youre  or older you know what happened they were a fraud and these  boys are too,1
if they want to earn more money then maybe they shouldnt have had a kid in the first place,0
i really hope one day everyone can fully understand what transgender really means  and can accept it and treat everyone equal,0
nonono you cannot eat as much as you want when you have the mindset of wanting to lose weight calories in vs calories out you need to be in a calorie deficit in order to lose weight eating food will not make you lose weight no matter what any miracle website out there tells you find out what your maintenance calories are the calories required to stay at your current weight and then eat under that there are  calories in one pound so as long as your total caloric deficit per week is around there you will drop a pound per week which is healthy also do not let these hclf people tell you avoid fat no fat you need fats in order to absorb certain vitamins and it aids in protein synthesis which helps build tissue  produce cells make sure youre doing this in a healthy manner do more research and find out what it is that you need to do i weight lift on a higher carb vegan diet  of my calories comes from carbs and it works for me so i can tell you that doing the lifestyle right will produce great results that you can stick to but if you do this completely blind youre gonna end up hitting a wall because someone turned you onto a vegan fad diet understand what macro and micronutrients are what they do to your body and how they work in sync with others make sure youre getting what your body needs depriving yourself will put your body at great risk understand calories in vs out etc etc just be smart about this and it will work trish good luck ,0
holy crap what words literally fail,0
number of female ceos  too damn low number of female coal miners just fine,0
im going veganbgshsbnsnjsndndndjjdjdnndjdnfhfwb haaah wtf can she slow fucking down,0
thank you i m vegan  yeargo vegan,0
tips eat bananas  they have alot of protein,0
this was the most ignorant video i get where you are coming from but you arent a gay man and you arent transgender you fit more into the demigirl category,0
love you blaire you always tell it straight forward and to the point hope this is just a case of trisha trolling again,0
huntee you need some pasta potatoes whole grains check out some nondairy milks go to whole foods you can find everything you need there,0
i support whatever the fuck people wanna be but just because you dress down or dress up it doesnt change who you are its common to not dress up everyday either its a everyday normal thing it means nothing but comfort or style that you may want to wear then and there i dont wear makeup everyday i try to just do my eyebrows or lashes before i leave the door thats it i try to dress up nicely for the most part but if i leave looking under dressed so what no one truly gives a shit and who cares if youre comfortable nothing to do with anything else,0
ummm so what im getting is you are pansexual and you are not sure what you are in terms of gender,0
you should definitely also eat more cooked carbs like potatoes rice and co also lentils beans and legumes in general are a great source of protein  and also greens are very healthy and important and also can be so yummy but the fruit is a good start for sure ,0
this is the only channel where i learn something new with every video,0
so this video claims the opposite of what others claim so which one is real,0
coming from a women im way happier why cant society understand as a  year old i totally understand why women protest and stuff like that but i know for sure they dont know how to fix it,0
why we should fight for just women rights and not for men and women where are my rights as a man i lost my rights this is so inequality we as humans should fight for human rights not a certain gender,0
how do they have an advantage theyre running,0
great video from a vegan of  years this lifestyle has positively changed my life in so many ways so grateful,0
what if we cant afford all the healthy food and we can only eat what our parents put on our plates,0
where i work women tend to want to work less hours and call in more often then men they also complain more about work and usually the manager has to cater to the woman more when it comes to the task at hand its just a number game though i cant say that there isnt women that are more capable then me but when it comes to labor its hands down a mans industry,1
trisha check out that vegan couple on here their channel will really help x,0
god damnit that woman is ugly,1
make a transgender league,1
someone doesnt have to identify as one or the other sexuality and gender is a spectrum ,0
i really hope she follows through with this shes going to be grateful she did,0
blaires reading every comment ehh heres my chance blaire will u marry me,0
or we could just leave the wage gap as is and let women be dependents,1
i dont think this is right but dont girls usually run faster anyway,0
omg i love you trish,0
factually correct  not really,0
has vox considered that perhaps women would prefer working longer hours at home and men would prefer working longer hours at work everyone makes tradeoffs and those tradeoffs often result in different wages there is nothing wrong with this and its a mistake to assume any difference between aggregate male wages and aggregate female wages is an injustice that must be remedied,0
but business have started to hire only women just last year almost rd of new hires were women despite being less than half of the workforce population this trend has been worsening in recent years and shows no signs of reversing,0
well she did say  weeks that is indeed a challenge lets hope shell keep it up further other then just two weeks ,0
trish ive followed you for years and this is music to my ears knowing what the animals go through kills me everydayso thank you for taking a step forward toward a higher consciousness ,0
trish is so uneducated on the topic the fact that she made a video about this is ridiculous ,0
i understand its kind of a trend right now but its really annoying the more you hear it women are purposefully making a raspy swing in their voice when they are speaking the california rasp its psychologically a way to show the woman doesnt feel comfortable sharing what shes sayingthe vocal tone is slow disengaging and tired kim kardashian and her siblings are great examples of it unfortunately the woman in this video sharing important information is doing it  look up the term vocal fry,0
really well explained,0
if youre born a female than youre a female this world is getting worse and worse,1
omg so happy for you trisha  give your body time and itll change for sure  i lost  pounds in a calendar year  i feel great  the first month is the hardest so try to keep motivated by watching videos and educate yourself  whatever you ate as a meat eater just make the vegan alternative  good luck trisha ,0
your still irrelevant freelee now you found someone else to be equally irrelevant with,0
how is this cheating these are women just like you libs said they are,0
why try to make jobs more flexible instead of making men care for children more wtf,0
noooooooo nooooo nooooo,0
hopefully she doesnt get your channel deleted for this ,0
i was born a female i grew up a tomboy i played tackle football and hockey still female i have a shaved head dont wear makeup and am tattooed still female i dated a gay guy long story  still female i am super independent opinionated and outspoken still female i think her video confession does more harm than good,0
how does this video not have  million disslikes lmao this is genius,0
potatoes rice beans and pasta are your friend,0
didnt trish say she smoked meth before im not trusting anything she says,0
 i love how you advocate flexible hours rather than ideally having men and women hold the same responsibilities at home because men just cant do it  but the comments section still manage to be an argument of how the problem doesnt exist  i guess it really makes sense then that my mother and her sisters make a lot more than their husbands because they work in jobs with flexible hours as a result they have to work a lot harder though,0
im vegan and there are a couple meals i eat that are super yummy white rice or wild rice with steamed broccoli and carrots with whatever sauce is your favorite over the top is so good if you put orange sauce or soy sauce over the top its just like its from panda for breakfast a smoothie or a banana or two and some english muffins with peanut butter or pb on them is delicious and pasta is always a good option when you are super hungry and want some carbs lol mix in some marinara and veggies and its bomb these are just some foods that i ate alot when i was transitioning cause thy were things i already ate when i wasnt vegan i love you trish ,0
we do it to ourselves and thats why it really hurts,0
they have to train too its not like they were born athletic its hard for boys to even get to their athletic skill being assigned male at birth doesnt make you stronger or faster their efforts are being undermined,0
trisha i love vegan chicken fingers the best brand is gardein you pop them in the oven for  minutes and theyre great with condiments or in salads theyre not the healthiest but when youre craving something breaded and crispy theyre a great option ben and jerrys also has nondairy ice cream the chocolate brownie one is my favorite since you live in la you are at the center of bunches of amazing vegan restaurants you have got to go try some i would also love to watch a video of you trying different vegan foods taste test on your channel good luck,0
the brand gardein i might have spelled it wrong has vegan chicken and other meat products that taste so similar to meat its unbelievable you can also make foods like grilled cheese with vegan products that taste amazing,0
why dont businesses hire only women like hiring people isnt already a resourceintensive expensive process and you think reducing the employee pool by half is an option have you ever worked,0
in my opinion i think you made your title wrong it should have been women are not being paid less because they are women there is a gap with male and female annual salaries is it unfair no there are many reasons women make less than men and it has nothing to do with them being simply women from being a women yes,0
so what these feminists want is equality of outcome not equal opportunity they want to they want to work crap jobs and get paid same as a ceo,0
holy shit someone other than a man made a video on this,0
trisha trader joes is a grt place to buy all kind of vegan food  not just fruit u should go again and just look for meat less stuff also that frozen potato n green bean n mashroom are soooo good try them ,0
im so confused i thought she was a toaster ,0
when feminist and sjws say that women are stronger and better than men just sayin,0
pathetic clearly not good enough to compete with the men they arent even heavily transitioned,1
the guy at the end sounded like the toefl instructions guy,0
i love this ladys voice ,0
does anyone have sources,0
i love vegan mexican food you can get tacoburrito shells and fill them up with rice beans salsa guac and veggies i usually have like two or three and they are super filling big smoothies are the best way to start the morning fill them with frozen bananas strawberries blueberries mango or whatever you want,0
right now ive been loving rice so easy so filling so healthy,0
dude you shouldnt make videos like this this is a highly controversial topic and may make many feminists very upset,0
sorry  is not  percent less than  it is  of  or  less obviously semantics but it changes the of the statistic pretty heavily,0
how about for the account of worked hours overwork i dont believe the wagegap is all that real the only diffrence is that woman tend to negociate less but if someone holds the exact same position in the same placew with the exact same hours youll see the wagegap is none exsistend the only diffrence is though how you willl negociate,0
not like she did a whole video on making eggs and bacon,0
clutural marxist propaganda,0
if youre not vegan youre doing it wrong,0
looks like hh broke her,0
your so hot,0
liz plank isnt going to be happy about this video,0
but people on the comments are even watched the video anyway just educate all people to help in domestic commission and help rise children but sometimes seems that both genders want just to complain,0
the data is from between  years ago you cant apply that to the current day and call it a fair comparison,0
to the six thousand people who diliked this video would any of you like refute any of what was said,0
hmmtired of onision,0
this are menthis is insane,1
meat is doneoverkaput,0
i would never expect it,0
oh god now onision is going to claim he is trans,0
im a tree,0
shame on these two boys they just cant compete with boys so they became girls,1
signs up for the girls wrestling team sees what wrestling team girls look like switches to boxing,0
right in this moment freelee is the most satisfied person on earth,0
wtf did she do to her lips,0
thank you so much for your work ive been vegetarianvegan for more than a year when i never ever thought i could do it its a necessity im in for life ,0
third day vegan never going back,0
these science projects makes me sick,1
but you stole those girls video you are bad for veganism freelee lol jk,0
she didnt talk about the reason why women go into lesser paying jobs why do women choose these less paying jobs why dont more women choose higher paying jobs women want to work regular hours because they are usually caring for childrenthey have families its not that they need to get to work though i am compelled by the no wage gap argument there is still a stigma though less prominent than it has been about where a woman should be placed in society,0
shit so i can increase my chance of winning state if i say im a girl at heart and was just born a guy wrestling here i come,0
what people miss on the wage gap is that it dont really exist unless youre a feminist and just want to get paid more for doing less,0
omg finally someone not speaking just some shit joining the mainstream thank you so much for this video,0
yassssssss trisha slay ,0
real life twilight zone,0
i like how you say its more complex seems like people on tumblr seem to never focus on the complexity of human society i swear tumblr has boarderline personality disorder,1
or we should pay them both equally so whoever wants to stay home can stay home and have the job they want to someone want stay home and have kids thats great for them somebody else wants to go to work men women it doesnt matter we should treat them like human beings with dignity and respect,0
trish girl on your snapchat just yesterday you were eating bacon and eggs,0
im going vegan today ,0
rice bean nuts seeds grains pasta veggies fruit etc smoothies for breakfast are so good  you can still have pizza just no cheese trisha eat till youre full you can still have a latt just ask for soya or coconut milk if you want to lose weight you cant eat too much you can put weight on eating a vegan diet trust me i did any questions just message me love u girl,0
blair i am sorry sweetie i think you are wrong you sort of dont get penis envy you have one you have the enviable position of having male privilege and female total feminist principles so be kind blair you are wrong be kind,0
i think the difference between men and women is a load of balls,0
there are many wayst o solve this wage gap problem i personally dont see it as a problem so long as earnings per hour is the same these mannerisms are all purely social and it boils down to undemonizing men and fathers as incompitent holliwood loves to show the mother as the does everything and the men as unparenting and if they are a good parent they are a divorced b mother died or c learning the mother is always more compitent in shows and movies in parenting this provides a social stigma that if there is a child in the family the man isnt the main influence its the woman this makes bosses in the business district highly uneasy with giving women promotions to jobs that require heavier hours or more rigorous work when they are pregnant as they will also have the burden of their children now another example is that in a core family ideal it is the man who does the work and the woman who stays home now when this ideal shifts its interesting to see how people react if both parents are working theyre both valued and putting money on the table if the father is working and the mother is not its considered a normal basic family if the mother is working and the father is taking care of the house he is often considered a leech and a deadbeat thus the men in order to avoid social hatred from peers and so on always gets a job or at least most men will try to get a job a woman on the other hand doesnt always need a job to be considered acceptable or normal a very huge example of this is in the military there is a large amount of males in there in a stable secure and well paying job while a large amount of women associated with the army happen to just be house wives without much of a job stastically this forces the wage gap to be in mens favor since they are socially required to be employeed or theyre considered practically on the same boat as criminals and meth heads finally this wage gap will probably never be fixed because of that earlier detail i mentioned the military is a dangerous job as well as lots of other jobs its clear that men favor or do not mind dangerous jobs that could result in injury or death while women on the other hand do not favor those jobs dangerous jobs pay more,0
the day we treat other human beings better is the day we treat the rest of the life on this planet including the planet itself better,0
hi mom i love u,0
make this viral,0
good job vox,0
yay vox waita not buy into femenist dogma and rationally explain it thank god if only the olympics video had done the same tho,1
shes just trying to make rent this month,0
so its been thoroughly debunked by trusted institutes yet feminists still cry about this and how can you downvote this its pure facts thats the equivalent of a child plugging their ears and yelling real loud because they dont want to go to bed or something,0
sjws and regressivism are losing people every day theyre in panic mode dont stop,0
how would one go about researching the wage gap myth what are key words to search for other than wage gap,0
finally a reasonable vox video,0
so the wage gap does exist just not in the same way we thought and its not necessarily fueled by direct sexism,0
okay but like i do not agree with trisha i dont think she is trans but when you brought sam smith and the person from queer eye into it saying they wanted to come out for clout i do not agree with that yes they might not talk about it maybe because they dont just want the attention if they just did it for clout dont you think they will make it a bigger thing than it already is yes the person from queer eye might have not came out in  but thats because not a lot of people were okay with lgbt and gender identity and things like that back then its  it is the best time to be coming out because you do have so many people supporting it and a lot more acceptance and a lot more rights not saying there arent people out there who hate but im just saying its more accepted now then it was a few years ago but with the whole trisha being trans thing yes she is obviously doing it for the clout and views no arguments on that one,0
this is awesome i remember trish saying in one of shanes videos that she didnt like animals and didnt care what happened to them so her  ethical reason was very surprising to me i really hope that she can make it work but at least now shes beginning to see the truth and the benifits,0
very good arguments but when i first heard this myth i did my own research and found that there is a different sized wage gap for every single job out there and that something like  of those is where women are the bigger earners so i think my arguments deviate somewhat from sommerss arguments but they still argue against the same lie,0
i love that you bought chik fil a especially because theyre run by people who support conversation therapy i will admit their chicken is good but not good enough for me to sleep at night after giving them my money,0
i dont buy it if its just a cleanse yes but ethical no youre going have to purge everything you own make up purses shoesdo your research so you dont get sick have fun trying something new and healthy watch what i eat in a day vegan vlogs very educational,0
so happy and thankful i discovered your channel freelee youre truly inspiring  btw im new to the vegan lifestyle does anyone have any recommendations for websites or youtube channels with vegan recipes,0
so basically you envy male dominance in todays society and wish you could feel the same power as a woman,0
i can totally see her genuinely feeling the way she described in her video but i also recognize that  she could just be trolling,0
i did not ask for this response video but i wanted it any way ,0
most of my male friends make less than their wives,0
this takes so much away from the real girls these guys have more bone density more muscle plus testosterone this is wrong,1
proud of trisha although i know shes probably not gonna stick with it,0
you are stealing the animals food,0
my brain hurts,0
you need way more than just fruit i tried that too but you have to have more than that to be healthy you need greens grains rice and starch you also need to eat beans for a snack eat seeds and nuts,0
do make up videos  xxxx  do make up videos please  some more please xxx  ,0
may i see your sores,0
have you looked into what gender fluid is,0
ive actually seen recordings of feminists saying that its wrong to pay women less just because of their choices and working hours d,0
im sorry this really pisses me off why is society changing the rules to make a few happy instead of the majority its b,0
all tea all shade ,0
again i want to commend vox for allowing comments almost all of the other sjw networks ban comments because they cant handle it thank you vox that being said  you are wrong the fact that most of the other networks covering this issue ban comments is a big sign that you are wrong they need to ban discussion on the topic to protect their fragile opinions i commend you for allowing the comments,0
common sense sign i cant believe that we cant even use this word easily damn postmodernism,0
fantastic job thank you sharing ,0
she thanking u for ur kindness when she met you not the bullyingbullying never works or putting people on spot,0
theres a pay gap between each person,0
so youre ah queer  stop making videos if you are not  sure,0
ahhh lovely start boo im super proud of you just make sure youre eating a lot more than that ,0
stupidity at its finest that is a very special kinda stupid too,0
 k dumb feminists disliked this,0
id hesitate to even call them girls without at least adding the word transgender in front they were born black men ergo naturally stronger and faster they have testosterone flowing through them putting on a wig and a sports bra and taking a couple shots of estrogen does not instantly make them girls nor does it grant them the right to be treated as such these confused peculiar men have an unfair advantage and they know it and these poor girls the real ones cant do anything about it,1
if a woman tells you that they earn less than a man for doing the same job just ask them to give you an exampleand that will be it,0
in soviet union we didnt have this problem called rising intonation,0
then people are nothing but a bunch of weirdos and i wouldnt trust them around my kids,0
love it trisha def try the huge variety of food u can have as a vegan def do some research on that,0
athletics are based of physical differences of male a female so their identity weather it is justified or not its not about identification its about physical ability i hate these people because their fuckin dumb,1
trisha your following is far too large for this madness and this is not a topic to toy with,0
not everyone can do it overnight i feel positive reinforcement when you do something good works better than punishment when you do something bad,0
k feminists disliked,0
so the main point they try to drive home here is jobs should allow schedule change more freely because of women,0
the fact that the parents or the  transgender girls dont see as this to be unfair is the real problem but we all know that if they were actually on the mens team we probably wouldnt even know who they are they wouldnt be dominating the boys track team its really disrespectful to continue to be on the team knowing that you have an advantage,0
yeah i am gonna stick with meat,0
new shirt this is vodka by the way,0
im nearly  i turned vegan  years ago after i became ill fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis and sky high blood pressure i am healthy now and im an animal rights activist and people cannot believe my age when they look at me  best thing ever govegan,0
i understood absolutely nothing in this video d,0
encouraging flexible hours us something conservatives and liberals can get behind,0
ill be damned a quality video from vox,0
these two are functionally male i dont have an issue with trans but you cant demand that others share your delusion yes ill call you by the gender pronoun she i will acknowledge you as your preferred gender to be polite  but do not expect to enter female restrooms female sports competitions or ask me to date you like i would a woman or ill go no way my dude,1
um how did i get here i was watching pewdiepie,0
i love trish but she had bacon and eggs on her snap yesterday and todays the ,0
get potatoesrice and pasta vegetables etc try high carb low fat diet,0
they call that cheater ,1

i struggle with existential depression everyday and this documentary gave me hope for the future i hope that we can all share our word that being vegan is one of the most powerful things you can do for the planet ,0
get gardein mini chicken burgers they taste similar to chicken burgers,0
i hear the call in  now more than ever is important to stop being greddy and see what is happening,0
with the pharmacy example  theyre saying we shouldnt own our own business to reduce the wage gap better to work for a multi billion dollar company than be your own boss,0
even if shes trolling that honestly makes it worse she has no issue making the lgbt community look like a bunch of confused attention seeker psychos just so she can get some attention she claims to care about lgbt rights but has no issue pulling this stunt that gives them more bad rep,0
go buy vegan chicken teriyaki and make it with rice and vegetables,0
can you make it seem more obvious that youre reading off of a prompter ffs,0
i would like to point out that those individual choices are affected by sexism and gender roles women are dissuaded from going into manly careers where they earn more because theyd be the only women in that workplace and people tell them its not a womans job yes its technically individual choice but its a highly railroaded choice,0
 triggered feminists,0
lmao trisha is on some extremely good drugs ,0
eat as much as you want girl vegetarian or vegan as long as you eat on a high carb vegan or vegetarian diet you wont gain weight itll take time to lose it yes but you wont gain,0
i think if they want to compete they should have to wear a set of balls hanging out the back of their pants like on jackass,0
so yesterday i was in history and my teacher started to pedal the wage gap myth i tried to debunk her but i didnt get enough evidence and almost got a lunch detention i really wish i had this video then lmao,0
i dont think anybody has the right to say if he is or isnt transgender trisha should be left to his own devices,0
yikes scary looking no matter how screwed up hisher gender is yow ,0
o so now its the jobs women work at and the way they choose to work   i thought it was misogyny and patriarchy ,0
my favourite at work is looking at over time  of women in my job decline the overtime whereas  of men accept it,0
man wtf  wow wow wow trish this isnt your diary if you need to put it in video form make the video and store that thing away we dont need to see and hear such tom foolery this is what happens when you dont have friends,0
co is pumped into greenhouses its not pollution plastic is the problem love from australia ,0
you have just explained that people who arnt available for a pm meeting because they have a kid to take care of get paid less than people that are more available either dont have kids or get your husband to do the chores both options that a woman and man have the choice to make whats the point of this wage gap conversation it basically says that some people prioritize their career over their family,0
i love how she said u can see a compelling argument on both sides what is the world coming too,0
post this on tumblr and the huffington post please,0
one of the variables for the  cents left is maternal verse paternal leave in australia employers are at least legally binned to offer  weeks paternal leave verse something like  weeks i think im not  sure for maternal leave so even if both people take their maximum allotted leave and come back with their spouse taking care of the child the man will still work more hours the pay given is still equal but less than they would earn than when theyre working therefore there is at least part of that  cents probably a large part due to it being not even mentioned in this video,0
thats not right boys are stronger faster,1
well i just dont want to do they type of jobs that pay a lot this is my choice it was not forced on me and a lot of women i know like doing theses things for their kids and do not mind men working more to make the money,0
you should eat fish,0
a michael jackson vegetarian what someone explain,0
me too i find it hard to watch any suffering,0
frozen grapes are the best thing ever,0
the comment section is horrendous people forgetting that these are still young children and they are excelling in healthy activity probably maintaining good to excellent grades and using their personal time wisely to perfect their craft and do what they love enjoying their youth and doing what makes them happy not being disrespectful at all but yet its a religious sexist racist vile and an astonishing amount of people spreading their hate in the comments its actually very sad change starts within yourself i hope that when you face a challenge or are challenged in some type of way where you are the minority you remember the hateful things that you typed here ,0
didnt expect this from vox,0
i think youtube is up to something i searched up gender pay gap myth and the top results were liberal videos with just over mil views when normally this video should come up because it had more views i liked this video but when i came back it said that i hadnt liked it google and youtube tries to censor out the right and promote their own left ideologies typical,0

this will probably last  days and she will be back to doing burger king haul taco bell etc,0
how is it fair they are physically stronger than biological girls there is nothing more to it they shouldnt compete agaisnt them when it is so clearly not a fair competition,1
thank you so much,0
omg this reminded me of when i was going through puberty and thought i was born in the wrong body because of all the hair growth lol i told my mom i was turning into a boy  thank goodness she didnt take it to the next level or i wouldve gone through the transition in my teens,0
be careful to not follow what freelee says because she works out like hardcore and a lot of people had the misconception that they could eat whatever they wanted and no exercise but you cant ive heard a lot of people gained weight after doing that so just be careful and you go girl,0
its sounds like you are nonbinary not transgender,0
probably the definitive book on this is warren farrells why men earn more written some four years before this study it identifies  areas where men on average make different decisions than women on average that is all the points made in this video and more the central insight is that the road to higher pay is a toll road higher pay generally means sacrificing something lowerpaid people do not why this is so important is that realising the actual reasons for the earnings gap empowers women  and men for that matter  to make choices to boost their earning potential if thats what they want to do any given person has of course the right to decide that they dont want to miss their kids soccer game move to the other side of the country or work in a highly stressful and competitive environment areas of their life other than their paycheck will doubtless benefit its just a bit silly for anyone  regardless of gender  to make these choices then turn around and compare their paycheck with another person who decided the money was important enough to them for them to make these and other sacrifices,0
yawnthis video could be so much shorter if she just got to the pointgood luck though and be careful because you can still gain weight,0
this is good journalism other vox reporters take note back up your claims with real facts and research and you will be better received,0
great initiative but sorry can you talk more slowly please   veggieone,0
chicken tenders arentt vegan,0
solution dont get kids or go into a flexible job thank you vox,0
we stan a black trans pregnant gay chicken nugget,0
wait so if she says that somedays shes a girl and somedays shes a boy isnt that genderfluid please correct me if im wrong,0
what happened to freelees instagram,0
i donno man i dont want to downplay her feelings but i think shes gotta a lot of information just doesnt know how to apply it shes valid in feeling the way she does but sis is throwing legitimate terms on her emotions just because you hate your name and feel more assertive doesnt mean youre trans,0
you dont understand  that shrinking gap is feminist activist achievement  not the female get more productive in the workplace,0
warning this channel spreads climate skeptism and denial this is no university channel but a fraud the founder of this channel dennis prager is a religious fundamentalist and a republican politician in us clearly this man wants to spread the hatred of other religions misinformation against gender equality and basic climate science i have no doubt that this channel is funded by big corporations to spread lies and misinformation in people and thus make them weaker against their interests please do not share or spread the videos posted by this channel,0
sorry but kim kardashian can never call herself a vegannot with all the products she uses that gets tested on animals as well as the implants im aware she hasnt called herself a vegan as yet,0
soooo since i dontt wear makeup i might be transgender too,0
dont calorie restrict or else youll feel horrible dont binge either make sure you eat each meal until you feel satisfied and saying that you cant eat just a banana or just an apple for a meal,0
i appreciate this study however most of the points it makes for reasons women do not work late is children the conservative side argues that women in general do not work longer hours before i accept this video at face value i would like to see the same study for women without children and see if the wage gap still exists there if it does your video might need some rethinking if it does not your video is legit and make sure the ages of the childless women are about the same as the ages of the women with children or the conservative side will argue that women tend to work harder at an earlier age and that the earlier aged men slack off more than their older counterparts have to have all bases covered,0
a drag queen has nothing to do with transgender sure some drag queens later transitioned ex gia gunn however their are drag queens who are gay bi pansexual even rarely straight its  people also drag shows are used as entertainment its a job thats why they dont go full glam everyday but they dress like gay men because they are gay men who are working drag queens smh trisha theres my two cents peace ,0
they forgot about taking into account different job positions as well as the fact that its illegal to pay a woman less,0
wages and earnings are not the same thing men and women have the same wages there is no wage gap there is an earnings gap because men do make more money only because they choose to do more difficult jobs and do more overtime and work more hours and take less breaksdays off and ask for raises more often women dont make as much money because they are not hard workers it has nothing to do with muh patriarchy,0
 years later and we are still talking about this,0
